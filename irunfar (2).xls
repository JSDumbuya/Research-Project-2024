2024 Grand Trail des Templiers Results: Caitlin Fielder and Thomas Cardin Victorious,"[Editor’s Note: This article was written by guest writer and runner,Deki Fourcin.] At 5:15 a.m. on the last day of the 2024 Festival des Templiers, the headlamps of 2,500 runners surged through the darkness as they began their journey through the heart of the Grands Causses Regional Natural Park in France’s Aveyron, for the 2024Les Templiers, or theGrand Trail des Templiersas it’s more formally called. Exactly 6 hours, 38 minutes, and 14 seconds later,Thomas Cardin(France) crossed the finish line to win the men’s race.Caitlin Fielder(New Zealand) dominated the women’s race, finishing in 7 hours, 42 minutes, and 24 seconds. After a rocky start to the week, when torrential rain and flooding threatened to disrupt the event, Sunday’s race was blessed with balmy temperatures, sunshine, and mostly dry trails. The course covers 80.4 kilometers (50 miles), with 3,429 meters (11,250 feet) of elevation gain, setting off from Millau and passing through the forests, canyons, and caves of the Causse Noir, the Causse Méjean, and the Larzac plateau before returning to Millau again. The race saw a significant increase in the prize money awarded to the top 10 finishers, with the first, second, and third places receiving €10,000, €4,000, and €3,000, respectively.

With neither choosing to return to defend their titles, the door was wide open for two new names to be inscribed on the list of champions. Les Templiers is the climax of the three-day festival and is France’s oldest trail race. It’s known for drawing in a star-studded lineup, and in its 30th year, the 2024 edition was no exception. In the women’s race, fans were expecting a showdown between the French duo ofClémentine GeoffrayandBlandine L’Hirondel, but it wasAdeline Martin(France) who took the early lead, dominating the race through 65 kilometers (40 miles). Fielder bid her time, pouncing during the final section to take the lead. She increased her lead through the later stages, flying down the final descent into Millau and crossing the line as the champion. The French delegation was strong in the men’s race too, withThéo Détiennetaking an early lead beforeThomas Cardintook the reins around halfway through the race. Cardin, who finished fourth in 2023, was a strong favorite, and his win marked the end of a six-year drought of French winners in the men’s race. By the race finish, Cardin had totally run away with the race, finishing nearly 20 minutes ahead of second place. Adeline Martin(France) andJennifer Lichter(U.S.) passed through the 8k mark together, followed by Norway’sSylvia Nordskar, France’sBlandine L’Hirondel, and New Zealand’sCaitlin Fielder. By 23k, a lead group including Martin, L’Hirondel, and Lichter had formed, coming through just in front of Nordskar,Clémentine Geoffray, and Fielder. Martin used the next 500-meter climb to the Massabiau checkpoint at 29k to her advantage, pulling away slightly from L’Hirondel and Lichter. Hot on their heels, Geoffray and Fielder made sure that the podium stayed in sight. The passage through Roquesaltes at 44k saw Martin increase her lead to almost three minutes, with Lichter and L’Hirondel holding onto second and third positions. Over the halfway point of the course, but with more than half of the elevation gain left to climb, less than three minutes separated positions two to seven. Nothing could be taken for granted, and everything was still at play. Martin held on to the gap on the next descent and the climb up and over to the La Salvage checkpoint at 56k. L’Hirondel, Nordskar, Fielder, and Lichter continued their pursuit of Martin there. The group kept their positions through the next couple kilometers, but then after that Fielder and Nordskar moved up to second and third, closing in continuously on Martin. Fielder and Nordskar made their move on the steep descent into Massebiau at 70k, storming onto the next climb in first and second before Fielder disconnected from Nordskar to take the ultimate lead. L’Hirondel and Geoffray were also there, now battling for third place. At this point, longtime leader Martin had dropped back in the field by a bit. Some 10 kilometers later at the finish, Caitlin Fielder crossed the line in first, holding a narrow 2.5-minute lead on the rest of the field. Sylvia Nordskar remained the second-place woman, also by a fairly narrow margin to third place, Blandine L’Hirondel. Only 90 seconds later, Clémentine Geoffray finished fourth, and about 10 minutes passed before fifth-place Jennifer Lichter next crossed the line. After leading the race for so many kilometers, Adeline Martin ultimately took eighth. The 2024 Grand Trail des Templiers women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Sylvia Nordskar, 1. Caitlin Fielder, 3.

There was some trading of places in the early miles, but by 23k, Détienne was two minutes ahead ofThomas CardinandRobin Juillaguet, both of France. Just behind, the lead peloton of 11 runners was still going strong, leaving the way open for anyone hoping to make a move. By 29k, although the runners were less bunched, there wasn’t much change to the order, with the top three holding firm, followed byAziz Yachou(Morocco) andSébastien Spehler(France). The sun was rising over the mountain peaks as runners approached St. Andrée de Vezines at 36k, and a determined-looking Détienne came through the village after two hours and 44 minutes of racing, with Yachou, Cardin, and Juillaguet in hot pursuit, around 1.5 minutes later. Cardin used the passage to 44k to his advantage, catching up with the leader, then taking the lead during the descent after that. Yachou and Juillaguet had also gained on Détienne, meaning that with 30k to go, the top four runners were all within a minute of each other. The section up to La Salvage at 56k climbs onto the Larzac plateau, featuring technical singletrack and nearly 500 meters of elevation gain over 8k. For the first time, there was a clear distinction between the top three places, with six minutes separating Cardin, Yachou, and Juillaguet. By the time Cardin arrived at Mas de Bru, with 16k to go, it seemed that his victory would be undeniable, having extended his lead over Yachou to six minutes. Cardin continued to power on in his victory quest, storming tirelessly up the final climb. By the time he reached the top, 7k from the finish line, he was over 17 minutes ahead ofMiguel Arsénio(Portugal), who’d overtaken Yachou to move into second place. Next to the top, and right on the heels of Yachou, wasAndreu Simón(Spain), and just behind, Détienne, determined not to lose sight of the podium. Simón had started the race more easily, moving up into and through the top 10 as the race progressed. Here, he’d placed himself in podium contention. In the last kilometers, Simón overtook Yachou, to move into third place. This ultimately settled the top five positions for the last downhill to the finishing arch, with Thomas Cardin storming over the line ahead of second-place finisher Miguel Arsénio, followed by Andreu Simón in third place. Rounding out the top five were Aziz Yachou and early leader Théo Détienne. Sébastien Spehler ultimately finished well outside of the top 10.

2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals Trail Race Results: Kipngeno and Adkin Win Series,"The 2024Mountain Running World Cupfinished with a pair of competitive races in northern Italy. The Saturday, October 12 vertical kilometer (VK) race and the Sunday, October 13 trail race marked the end of this year’s 12-race series that spanned seven countries. It was a fitting end. Kenya’sPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andJoyce Muthoni Njeruwon the race, while Kipngeno and the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won the series. Kipngeno and Adkin earned €5,000 for their world cup wins, part of a €30,000 prize purse that paid money 10 deep. TheWorld Mountain Running Championshipshappen every other year. The event was contested last year in Austria and will happen again in 2025 in Spain. Absent a world championships event in 2024, the Mountain Running World Cup Finals take on greater importance this year. The World Mountain Running Association administers both. The Sunday, October 13 trail race was contested as part of theVal Bregaglia Trailrace. The course stretched 23 kilometers long and with 850 meters of climbing and 900 meters of drop on a point-to-point course from Switzerland to Italy.

The 29-year-old Klein ran Sierre-Zinal this year too, finishing 205th. Call that a bad day, though; his better results include a third at this year’s European Off-Road Championships and a sub-30 minute 10,000-meter run as recently as 2021. Klein greatly outperformed that Sierre-Zinal result here. France’s Théodore Klein leads the 2024 Val Bregaglia Trail at 16 kilometers into the race. He was a pace pusher all race, and ultimately finished in third.

2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals VK Results: Adkin and Elia Fastest to Top,"After 10 races across seven countries, the 2024Mountain Running World Cupwraps up with a pair of finals on back-to-back days in Italy. Up first, theKilometro Verticale Lagùncran on Saturday, October 12, where the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Italy’sAndrea Eliaemerged as uphill champions. TheWorld Mountain Running Championshipshappen every other year. The event was contested last year in Austria and will happen again in 2025 in Spain. Absent a world championships event in 2024, the Mountain Running World Cup Finals take on greater importance this year. The World Mountain Running Association administers both. A true vertical kilometer (VK), the uphill race gained 1,000 meters over 3.3 kilometers in distance. With a history dating back to 1986, it is the oldest VK race in the world. The course took runners from Chiavenna to Lagùnc, Italy, and was run in a time-trial format with runners sprinting from the start every 15 seconds. It was a cool morning with some rain and mist, making for fine conditions, if a little bit slippery on some sections of the course. Finally, this VK served as the 2024 Italian VK National Championships, which brought some additional competition. Many of the runners doubled back on Sunday, October 13, to run theVal Bregaglia Trailrace to conclude the series. Read ourresults articlefor that full race story.

World cup series leaderJoyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya) went third to last, and was followed from the start line by the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Kenya’sPhilaries Kisang Jeruto(pre-race interview).

Adkin won the race in 37:57, ahead of Jeruto Kisang’s 38:35. Adkin had a commanding 38-second lead when the finish times flashed. It was Adkin’s third world cup win of the year, on top of a strong second-place finish at Sierre-Zinal this year.

Her runner-up spot matched last year’s silver medal at the 2023 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race. Stampanini’s surprise early-in-the-race 39:13 split held up as third best. Series leader and 2024 star across both the Mountain Running World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series, Muthoni Njeru was just fifth on the day in 39:55. That was, however, enough for her to hold onto her world cup series lead heading into the next day final race.

The first man left the start line at 10:01 a.m. and another followed every 15 seconds clear up through 11:43 a.m. As with the women, the top men went last. The world cup series leader, Kenya’sPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), started fourth to last. The U.S.’sJoseph Gray(pre-race interview), as with Kipngeno, a former uphill world champion, was seventh to last, and second in the world cup rankings. Kenya’sPhilemon Kiriago(pre-race interview), was ninth to last at the start line. As with the women’s race, there was rain and mist alternately throughout, making for wet terrain on the climb. Italy’s Andrea Elia, the 2024 Kilometro Verticale Lagunc champion, which was part of the Mountain Running World Cup Finals. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The world cup has been dominated by Kenyan runners this year, and the country had six runners in the field. At the finish, though, it was the host country that starred. Italy placed four runners inside the top seven. When the race organizers laid out this start order, somehow they absolutely nailed it. Just fifth at last week’s 2024 Šmarna Gora race in Slovenia,Andrea Elia(Italy) started the race second to last.Henri Aymonod(Italy), an uphill powerhouse who won last year’s race here, went last from the starting line. Italy’s Henri Aymonod looks calm on his way to taking second at the 2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals VK.

Elia hit the top after 31:08 and Aymonod was only seven seconds behind in 31:15. Italy thus stood atop both the gold- and silver-medal podium positions. Kipngeno, last year’s World Mountain Running Uphill Champion, was third in 31:50. As with Muthoni Njeru in the women’s race, that did score enough points to still lead the overall series heading into the next day’s final race on October 13.

Mammoth Trail Fest 26k Results: Joyce Muthoni Njeru and Elhousine Elazzaoui Dominate,"The eighth race of the 2024 Golden Trail World Series, and the last before the final, theMammoth Trail Fest 26kkicked off in Mammoth Lakes, California, at 10 a.m. on Sunday, August 22. The 16.1-mile course, starting and ending in Mammoth Village, has more than 3,900 feet of climbing and tops out at 11,053 feet, making it a proper high-altitude race. Racers were greeted with cool, clear, and sunny conditions on race morning. The women started 20 minutes ahead of the men, providing them with their own race. Golden Trail World Series leaderJoyce Muthoni Njeruof Kenya took the early lead and never gave it up, finishing nearly three minutes ahead of Romania’sMădălina Florea. In the men’s race, the top four in the series standings ran together earlier on beforeElhousine Elazzaouiof Morocco andPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya pulled away over the summit of Mammoth Mountain and ran together for the rest of the race to a sprint finish, where Elazzaoui came away with the win. The event is the queen event of the three-day Mammoth Trail Fest event. With a $21,000 prize purse up for grabs and prize money going 10 deep — as well as points leading into the Golden Trail World Series final up for grabs — the field was filled with some of the best shorter-distance trail racers vying for the top spot on the podium. After leaving the village, the single-loop course climbs steeply to the top of Mammoth Mountain in the first 7.5 miles, gaining nearly all of its elevation in the span of three miles along the Dragon’s Back. From the summit, it drops steeply to the McCoy aid station, tackling the new Bullet downhill, before starting a more gradual descent on mountain bike trails back into the village for a final romp through the streets to the finish line. Joyce Muthoni Njeruof Kenya, the current leader of the Golden Trail World Series, didn’t waste any time, taking off from the start to establish an early lead in the women’s race. By the first aid station at Twin Lakes, 3.6 miles and 25:21 in, but before any of the steep climbing, she’d already opened up an 18-second gap on second-placeMădălina Floreaof Romania and a 39-second gap on third-placeLauren Gregory.

Photo: Sarah Attar Muthoni Njeru reached the summit of Mammoth Mountain, 7.5 miles into the race, at 1:14:29, leading Florea by more than two minutes. But coming over the top, Florea opened up her stride, not ready to surrender the race. Behind them, on the steep, rocky, and switchbacking climb up to the summit of Mammoth Mountain,Rachel Drakeput in a huge effort to move into third over the summit, two and a half minutes behind Florea and with a 17-second lead onAnna Gibsonin fourth place. Gregory was just another 30 seconds back in fifth, the spots for the podium still up for grabs on the long downhill. Florea held a fast pace on the initial miles of the downhill, looking to be running much more aggressively than Muthoni Njeru on the wider open sections on the ski resort, but was unable to close the gap. Coming into the McCoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles in 1:37:24, Muthoni Njeru held a 2:09 lead on Florea, while Drake and Gibson ran together another 4:38 back. Gregory was only a minute back from the duo, still within reach of third. After McCoy, racers faced the Bullet downhill, a newly added section of steep and technical downhill on the course. The steeper sections didn’t slow anyone down, and as the race reached the flatter mountain bike trails, Muthoni Njeru continued to hold a strong pace in the lead, reaching the Garage checkpoint at mile 14.8 in 1:56:45. Florea was 1:56 behind with a significant six-minute gap over third-place Drake and fourth-place Gibson, who continued to run together. Joyce Muthoni Njeru cruised into the finish without any pressure with a time of 2:11:56, taking her third win in the series and further padding her overall series lead, and Mădălina Florea finished second in 2:14:51, after taking a fall and cutting her knee. Anna Gibson used her background in the track to pull away from Drake on the gradual downhill to take third. (In 2023, Ostrander was suspended for four months after testing positive for canrenone, a metabolite of spironolactone, after it was determined that she mistakenly took the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.) Full results. It didn’t take long for the top four men in the Golden Trail World Series standings to separate themselves from the rest of the field.Philemon Ombogo Kiriagoof Kenya andRémi Bonnetof Switzerland pushed the pace on the relatively flat early miles, withElhousine Elazzaouiof Morocco andPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya chasing. The group came through the first aid station at Twin Lakes around 22 minutes into the race within 10 seconds of each other, and 15 seconds clear of the rest of the field. Last year’s winner and course-record holder, Bonnet, was just 48 hours clear of winning the vertical kilometer (VK) race and had stated in a pre-race interview that he planned to stay with the leaders early on before launching an attack on the climb, hoping to create a gap big enough to hold off the rest of the field before the downhill. But when the climbing started, Elazzaoui, Kipngeno, and Ombogo Kiriago pushed the pace and opened up a gap on the defending champion. Kipngeno was the first to the summit in 1:01:50, just three seconds up on Elazzaoui, who is known for his descending prowess. The duo had opened up a significant 1:40 gap over Bonnet, who looked to be struggling, potentially dealing with fatigue from his VK effort two days prior, and Ombogo Kiriago, who also dropped off the pace, another 40 seconds back. In the early miles of the downhill, Elazzaoui let Kipngeno set the pace on the twisting singletrack, and the two came into the McCoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles together in 1:21:38. Elazzaoui continued to stay behind Kipngeno, letting small gaps open before cutting the apex of the corners, taking slightly shorter routes to repeatedly close the gap. When the two came to the new, and steep, Bullet Downhill section, Elazzaoui, who had been clearly biding his time, made his move and quickly opened a significant gap with only a few miles to go. At the Garage checkpoint, Elazzaoui, who is not known for liking to lead alone, was back with Kipngeno with 2.3 miles to go, setting the pair up for a sprint finish. Behind them, Bonnet was three minutes back. In the final streets, Elazzaoui opened up the sprint first, and when Kipngeno tried to get by on the inside of a corner, he found himself blocked by the Moroccan and had to hit the brakes. Elazzaoui took the win in 1:49:35 and also took the overall lead for the Golden Trail World Series going into the final. Ombogo Kiriago came in third ahead of last year’s winner Bonnet.

2024 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile Results: Mann Sets Course Record and Lockwood Secures Second Victory,"TheRun Rabbit Run 100 Milehas been a quintessential American fall 100 miler for years, both for its mountain fall scenery and competitive dynamics, and the 2024 edition was no different. In the men’s race,Richard Lockwoodran away with his second win, backing up his 2022 victory with an even faster and more dominant performance. In the women’s race, CanadianEmilie Mannset a new course record by running 19:48:05, in doing so bestingMichele Yates’smark of 20:16:54, which had stood since 2013, by more than 27 minutes. For 2024, the event experienced good weather, with warm daytime conditions leading to a cool to cold night, all normal for a mid-September weekend in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile course is about 101.5 miles long, with 20,300 feet of climbing, and takes place at altitudes ranging from about 6,600 to 10,600 feet. Uniquely, this event hosts two starts, one for the speedier “hares” and another for the steady “tortoises.” The hares’ race began on Friday, September 13, at 1 p.m. local time and had a 30-hour cutoff. Also uniquely, this event hosts a huge prize purse — over $100,000 in total — with $15,000 going to the men’s and women’s winners, prize money seven deep in both races, and a host of other dollars doled out for preems, a team event, masters and senior runners, and more.

To those of us watching from the outside, he seemed to be patiently passing the miles until the other men around him dropped back one by one. The last man fell behind somewhere before mile 71, and from there, Lockwood exerted utter dominance over the men’s field. His lead grew slowly at first, and rapidly in the race’s final miles, until he crossed the line in 17:24:41. This was about 47 minutes clear of the second man and 35 minutes faster thanhis 2022 victory.

His 18:12:17 was well clear of third place. With three prior finishes at this event, including fifth and sixth places,Christopher Hammesknows how to run this race. Letting some of the racing games happen around him while running in the middle of the men’s top 10 for most of the race, he moved into his ultimate third-place position after mile 82 to finish in 18:56:34, close to an hour faster than his best prior finish. This follows a win at the 2024 High Lonesome 100 Mile less than two months ago. Tyler GreenandNicholas Lightbodyrounded out the men’s top five. With this finish, Green caps off a summer 100-mile double that saw him take seventh at the 2024 Western States 100 before finishing fourth at this race, and Lightbody continuing to develop his trail-ultra career, following up on sixth at the Black Canyon 60k and second at the Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile in 2024. Full results. In winning the women’s race,Emilie Mannof Canada made event history, setting a new course record and besting a record time that had stood for 11 years. Her approach was to chill among the lead women early, run a steady middle race, and totally slay the final miles. At the top of the first climb, Mann arrived among a passel of fast women, running a minute and change behind earliest leader and course record holderMichele Yates. As late as mile 89, Mann was still running in second place behind then-leaderLeah Yinglingbefore assuming the lead, running away with things, and finishing in 19:48:05, a win of over 30 minutes. Second-place Yingling put up a heckuva fight, running among the top women early, assuming the women’s lead for some of the race’s middle to late miles, and ultimately taking second in 20:19:24, just 2.5 minutes shy of the prior course record. This possibly closes a big year of racing for Yingling, which has included participating in the lululemon FURTHER six-day event in the spring and taking 10th at the 2024 Western States 100 in the summer. Shea Aquilanocrossed the line to finish in third place in the women’s race, but was marked later as a DNF. Her social media explains that she went off course for about two miles, but didn’t know until after the finish. Barrett Graywas, thus, retroactively moved up into third position, in what looks to be her 100-mile debut. Nicole Laughtontook fourth, whileStacey Marionwas the fifth woman. For Laughton, this performance follows up on past wins at events like the Rocky Raccoon 100 Mile and Arkansas Traveler 100 Mile in recent years. And Marion caps off a big summer here following a finish at the Broken Arrow Skyrace 46k and a win at the Tushars Mountain Runs 100k.

2024 UTMB Results: A Course Record for Schide and a Surprise Win for Bouillard,"For the front of the field, the 2024UTMBis already history. The iconic UTMB course, with its 176 kilometers (109.3 miles) and almost 10,000 meters (32,500 feet) of elevation gain, has crowned new champions, as more than 2,500 runners try to encircle the Mont Blanc massif from Chamonix, France, through Italy and Switzerland, before finishing back in Chamonix. In the women’s race, AmericanKatie Schidemade sure there were no similar surprises at the top of the podium. In a commanding, nearly wire-to-wire victory, Schide crossed the finish line in 22:09:31 to breakCourtney Dauwalter’scourse record by 21 minutes, secure her second win at UTMB, and complete the Western States 100-UTMB double in the span of just over two months. “When I went out fast this year, I wasn’t afraid like I was in 2022,” Schide said after the race, referring to the first year she won UTMB. “From two more years of training, I had the confidence to run my splits.” Katie Schide claiming her second UTMB win in three years, this time in course-record time. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks KiwiRuth Croftand CanadianMarianne Hoganfinished in second and third, respectively, for a strong podium. At the finish line in Chamonix,Vincent Bouillardput his hands on his head in disbelief and smiled toward the crowd: He had done it. In one of the biggest — and most unexpected — breakthroughs in the history of the storied race, Bouillard, an unsponsored Frenchman who works in research and development for Hoka, won the 2024 UTMB in 19:54:23, to become the fifth runner to break the mythical 20-hour mark and cement his name in race lore. “Winning UTMB was never expected,” said Bouillard, a former track and field athlete turned trail runner. “I’ve been coming to this race since almost the beginning for my work, but only in my wildest dreams would I win it.” Vincent Bouillard after becoming the unlikely champion of the 2024 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Those wildest dreams became reality on a hot day in France, which saw several of the pre-race favorites, including AmericanJim Walmsley, the U.K.’sTom Evans, and FrenchmanGermain Grangier, drop out. Bouillard, along with second- and third-place finishersBaptiste Chassagneof France andJoaquín Lópezof Ecuador but living in Spain, took advantage of the opportunity to complete a podium that perhaps not many people predicted. But that, of course, is the beauty of ultrarunning, especially at a race as competitive and deep as UTMB. A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of UTMB possible! Read on for full race details. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: After finally breaking through to become the first American man to win UTMB last year — with a course record, no less —Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) entered this year’s race as one of the clear favorites. He had also won, for the fourth time, the Western States 100 in late June to set up an attempt to become the first man sinceKilian Jornetin 2011 to win the Western States 100-UTMB double. In his pre-race interview, Walmsley projected calmness and perspective. “The cards that I have in my hand this year are different,” he said, “but also, I wouldn’t be lining up if I didn’t think I had a chance to compete up front.” And for nearly nine hours, that’s exactly what he did. Walmsley, wearing bib No. 2, started with the pack but took the lead by 35k as the climbing — and night — set in. He ran at the front for the next several hours, stopping for two minutes at the Les Chapieux aid station (51k), and came into Lac Combal (70k) looking strong and still in the lead, leaving in less than 90 seconds. The start of the 2024 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein But between there and Courmayeur at 83k, he began to struggle, dropping nine places to 10th and 13 minutes off the lead. As he entered the large aid station that serves as the near halfway point of the race, he looked rough. While the race leaders were efficient with their stops, Walmsley sat to eat for a relatively long time and did not look like he wanted to get up. He would later officially drop, a tough conclusion to a promising race for the champion. Winning the Western States 100-UTMB double still seems to be one of the most challenging feats in men’s ultrarunning. “Jim has been struggling to shake a knee injury since Western States,” reada post on his Instagram story, “but wanted to give himself the chance to see what the day would give him.” Walmsley was not the only of the pre-race favorites to drop out. The U.K.’sTom Evans(pre-race interview) — who followed up a third-place finish at the 2022 UTMB by winning the Western States 100 last year — had a very similar race to Walmsley, running near the front for the first half of the race and entering Courmayeur in second. He was part of a large chase pack that had passed Walmsley by 83k and spent less than three minutes at the large aid station, leaving in third behind FrenchmanGermain Grangier(pre-race interview) and eventual championVincent Bouillard(post-race interview), another Frenchman. Jim Walmsley and Tom Evans leading the 2024 UTMB in Les Contamines at 31k. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi By Refuge Bertone at 88k, though, he began to look fatigued and though he remained in the top five until 101k, by Grand Col Ferret at 106k he had dropped 23 places to 28th. He would also later drop — another top contender out of the race. “Tom has sadly had to withdraw. He is okay and with family and friends,” read apost on his Instagram story. “Fueling became an issue through the night and you can’t run this race on empty.” The carnage, unfortunately, did not stop there, either. Grangier looked strong for more than 115k, running in second and charging up the hill at Grand Col Ferret at 106k and looking calm at La Fouly 10 kilometers later, only six minutes behind Bouillard. He stayed in second as the morning came, but looked fatigued by Trient at 146k, where he would also drop. FrenchmenMathieu Blanchard, who famously battled Jornet at the2022 UTMB for a second-place finish, andAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-race interview), whowon both the Hardrock 100and Diagonal des Fous in 2023, both dropped at 69k, while Spain’sPau Capell, the2019 UTMB winner, dropped at Courmayeur like Walmsley. Germain Grangier runs into Champex-Lac during (128.5k) the 2024 UTMB. He would drop late in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi None of this is to take away from the brilliance of Bouillard or the other top finishers, who survived the historic carnage and heat to come away with some performances of a lifetime. It starts and ends, of course, with Bouillard, who was on few people’s radar when the race began. Last year, Bouillard, who does not even have a photo on hisofficial UTMB page, won the Kodiak 100 mile and Gorge Waterfall 100k, but few expected him to compete at the world’s most competitive trail race. He did exactly that. Wearing bib No. 139, Bouillard ran in the lead pack at the start of the race, coming through Refuge de la Croix du Bonhomme at 46k in ninth, and methodically working his way up to the front, entering Lac Combal at 70k in second. By Courmayeur, he had taken the lead and spent less than three minutes refueling before heading back into the early morning darkness. From there, he would not relinquish the lead, running the rest of the race relatively unchallenged as he continued to look strong and smooth as the sun rose. Later in the morning, he would cross the finish line to seal a strong and surprising win. Men’s champion Vincent Bouillard descends into Vallorcine (158k), on his way to winning the 2024 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Brady While Bouillard won by nearly 30 minutes, there was a true race behind him. France’sBaptiste Chassagne(post-race interview) ran in the top 20 for most of the first 60k and entered Courmayeur in 11th. By 129k, he and fellow FrenchmanArthur Joyeux-Bouillon, who had taken the opposite approach by running at or near the front from the start, were within seconds of each other in fourth and fifth place, respectively, and 34 minutes behind Bouillard. Chassagne continued to look and run strong, entering Trient at 146k in second just ahead of the Ecuadorian living in Spain,Joaquín López(post-race interview), where he would remain until he crossed the finish line in 20:22:45 for his most impressive finish of his six-year streak of a top 10 at a UTMB Mont Blanc festival race. Baptiste Chassagne was pretty stoked to take second at the 2024 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks López, meanwhile, had a very similar race to Chassagne, running in the top 30 at the start of the race before moving into 10th position by the time he left Courmayeur. Over the final half of the race, he moved up even further, and was just four minutes behind Chassagne at 161k. He could not ultimately catch him, but he did hold off Germany’sHannes Namberger(pre-race interview) to finish third in 20:26:22.

Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Namberger, a two-time top-10 finisher at UTMB, had another strong race to finish fourth in 20:31:54, looking like he might nab a spot in the top three with a fast finish. The agelessLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) of France, who just over a month agoset the course record at the Hardrock 100, had another stellar performance, moving up from 47th at 40k, all the way to 10th by 100k, before picking off several runners in front of him to finish fifth in 20:57:48. It was his second straight fifth-place finish. Joyeux-Bouillon held on for sixth, while AmericanCody Lindran into seventh position. Spots eight through 10 — Spain’sManuel Anguita Bayoalong with FrenchmenGautier BonnecarrèreandYannick Noël— were separated by only four minutes, with Bonnecarrère and Noël appearing to tie for ninth in 21:45:16.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Just two months ago,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), an American living in France,led the Western States 100 from wire to wire and nearly broke the course record en route to a commanding win. On Saturday in France, Schide somehow improved on that performance: She again won in dominating fashion, but this time also nabbed the course record to cap one of the most impressive doubles in ultrarunning history. (Of course, last year,Courtney Dauwalter, who did not race UTMB this year, won each race in the Western States 100-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple.) In her pre-race interview, Schide, who lives and trains in France, admitted that her primary focus this season was on the Western States 100 and that she took the runner’s insurance for UTMB when she signed up in January in case she canceled. After she dominated an impressively deep and competitive field on Saturday, though, it was hard to believe UTMB was not the top race on her calendar this year. Katie Schide in La Floria just 4k from the finish and a new UTMB course record. Photo: iRunFar/Amiria Macbeth Schide went out fast and kept that assertive pace for nearly an entire day of running. She was 21st overall at the first aid station at 13k; New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Canadian living in FranceMarianne Hogan(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the eventual second- and third-place finishers were, respectively, 118th and 72nd overall there. Schide did not take her foot off the gas and continued to run with her characteristic calm, strength, and smile, entering the Lac Combal aid station at 70k in 7:34, looking focused. By Courmayeur at 83k, she was 50 minutes under course-record pace and nearly 40 minutes ahead of Hogan, and by La Fouly at 116k, she was nearly an hour under record pace. The only question from there was if she would set the record. With Hogan losing 10 minutes in 12 kilometers by 141k to fall to 40 minutes back, Schide’s win seemed close to inevitable, especially with the way she was running. Just before Vallorcine at 158k, Schide’s lead on the course record had lessened to 32 minutes and a few kilometers later she was working hard and taking encouragement from fans. With four kilometers to go, she smiled as the crowds cheered her on, knowing that history was just minutes away. She reached Chamonix and the celebration began. Schide smiled to the crowd and gave several high fives before crossing the finish line more than 20 minutes faster than any woman had done before, and the double was complete. Katie Schide after winning UTMB for the second time. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks If Schide was chasing history, Croft was chasing dozens of runners in front of her. Croft, who was forced to withdraw before the start of last year’s race due to illness, came into UTMB as one of the favorites, having won the Tarawera Ultramarathon and Transvulcania earlier this year. She ran conservatively at the start, coming through 31k in sixth place next to AmericanAmanda Basham, 22 minutes off the lead, and later falling to ninth place almost 38 minutes back just over 10 kilometers later. But by 88k, with about half of the race in front of her, Croft had moved up to fifth, next toEmily Hawgoodof Zimbabwe, who lives in the U.S, and from there she kept moving up. At the Grand Col Ferret at 106k, she was in fourth behind Schide, Hogan, and2023 third-place finisherBlandine L’Hirondelof France, but Croft did not hang around: She broke into a run as soon as she started the descent. Ruth Croft flying through Champex-Lac (128.5k). Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi By 129k, she had passed L’Hirondel and was in third place, looking fast and determined. At Trient, 17 kilometers later and about a half-hour behind Hogan, Croft was the only woman to run through the entire section and looked to be on the hunt. By 158k, she had cut Hogan’s lead to 14 minutes and looked the stronger of the two, flying downhill and making up time. Between there and the climb up to La Flégère, Croft finally passed Hogan and left six minutes ahead. With four kilometers to go, she was in second and flying to the finish. She’d reach it in 22:48:37, just over 22 minutes ahead of Hogan, in her debut at the race. Hogan,who finished second in her 2022 UTMB debut, had another strong race, running in second for most of the day with a smile on her face, before fading late. She didn’t let falling to third dampen her spirits, high-fiving fans and enjoying their cheers at La Floria four kilometers from the finish after being passed by Croft. After crossing the line in 23:11:15, she was greeted by a large team at the finish to celebrate her second podium finish in three years. Marianne Hogan running through Champex-Lac in second. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Behind the top three, there were more strong performances. China’sLin Chenfinished fourth in 24:16:33, while L’Hirondel put it all on the line for a fifth-place finish. The ever-smiling Hawgood, a paragon of consistency who seemingly always finishes in the top 10 of major trail races, was about 22 minutes behind her in sixth with a time of 24:58:19, her third top-10 finish at UTMB and fastest by more than an hour-and-a-half. Lin Chen in Champex-Lac on her way to taking fourth at the 2024 UTMB.

And perhaps there are no better illustrations of the depth of the women’s field than Stanley, who passed Tremps late to improve her time from last year’s ninth-place finish by roughly 90 minutes, and Bartholomew, who finished in 10th for the second year in a row — but with a time 1 hour and 45 minutes faster than last year’s.

"2024 CCC Results: Hawks Wins Again, McCann Victorious in Step Up in Distance","The 100-kilometerCCCrace left Courmayeur, Italy at 9:00 a.m. local time on Friday, August 30. Official stats put the race at 62.7 miles and with 19,888 feet (over 6,000 meters) of elevation gain. The race goes the opposite direction from the earlier-in-the-weekTDS, connecting the race start in Courmayeur to Champex-Lac, Switzerland and then the finish line hub in Chamonix, France. As withOCCandUTMB Mont Blancfor the 50k and 100-mile distances, CCC too was the UTMB World Series final for the 100k distance, and that meant €13,000 to each of the winners and prize money going 10 deep. The total CCC prize purse was €76,000. Hayden Hawks winning the 2024 CCC. Photo courtesy of HOKA. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: Pre-race favoriteToni McCann(South Africa, living in France) led early with onlyMartyna Młynarczyk(Poland) in reach. The two were less than a minute apart 16 miles into the race. McCann, the 2023 OCC winner, was expected to be here, but Młynarczyk was a surprise this high up. She was sixth at the Tenerife Bluetrail by UTMB 73k earlier this year, but also a standout Ironman triathlete. A chase group led by 2023 fourth-placerHau Ha Thi(Vietnam),Jazmine Lowther(Canada), andHeather Jackson(U.S.) was over seven minutes back. McCann’s lead swelled as she climbed through Italy up to the Grand Col Ferret. She was now nearly four minutes up on Młynarczyk and over 10 minutes on everyone else. Lowther fell back to seventh on the climb and would later drop from the race, and Jackson moved up to third.Holly Page(U.K.) entered the top five, 17 minutes behind the race leader. Roughly halfway into the race at mile 34 in Champex-Lac, Switzerland, it was still McCann and, boldly, Młynarczyk at the front with a big gap on everyone else. McCann led Młynarczyk by almost three minutes, and everyone else was at least 14 minutes behind Młynarczyk. Ha Thi was again third, Jackson fourth, andRosanna Buchauer(Germany) had moved into fifth 13 minutes in front of a now sixth-place Page. Ten miles later at mile 44 Trient, Switzerland, McCann and Młynarczyk were still out front, but Buchauer had fallen 22 minutes off the lead, while still third alongside Ha Thi. Finally, by mile 51 in Vallorcine, France, McCann fully broke free of Młynarczyk. The gap between the first and second runners was now eight minutes, and Buchauer had regained some separation from Ha Thi. Buchauer was six minutes ahead of fourth-place Ha Thi. At the top of the last climb, La Flégère, the positions were set. It was just a four-mile downhill run to Chamonix to go, and McCann, Młynarczyk, and Buchauer kept their podium spots in order. McCann won in 11:57 in her debut at the 100k distance. Młynarczyk finished a breakout run in second at 12:11. Buchauer was third in 12:16. Toni McCann of South Africa winning the 2024 CCC.

Sixteen miles into the race the first 20 men were barely two minutes apart. The group included pre-race favorites likeAdam Peterman(U.S.),Hayden Hawks(U.S.),Manuel Merillas(Spain), andPetter Engdahl(Sweden, living in Norway), among others. A nearly three-mile climb up to the Grand Col Ferret at mile 19 thinned the pack. Hawks gained a 30-second lead over Peterman and Engdahl, and everyone else fell off the lead group by at least two minutes. Seth Ruhling(U.S.), the race’s 2023 sixth-place finisher, bridged up and ran into the lead alongside Peterman on the next downhill to La Fouly, Switzerland at mile 25. Hawks was just 22 seconds behind at the checkpoint. Ruhling dropped from the race shortly later with an ankle injury, Engdahl too, and Hawks passed Peterman five hours into the race when climbing to Champex-Lac. Behind Hawks and Peterman,Huo-Hua Zhang(China) charged in third two minutes behind, andAndreu Simon(Spain) andDan Jones(New Zealand) were over three minutes back in fourth and fifth. Hawks continued to lead through Trient, Switzerland, seven hours into the day. His training mate Jones briefly moved into second, over three minutes back. Hawks and Jones were third and fourth in June at the Western States 100. Peterman was now third, 50 seconds behind Jones andPeter Fraňo(Slovakia), third at the 2023 Trail World Championships Long Trail, was in fourth now less than two minutes behind Peterman. Zhang started to fall back climbing to mile 46. He moved to fifth, while Hawks grew his lead. Hawks led Peterman, Jones, and Fraňo by seven, eight, and 10 minutes respectively at that mile 46 timing point. No one could catch Hawks the rest of the way. He won in 10:20. Hawks won CCC back in 2017 too, then in 10:24. Fraňo escaped the chase group over the final climb for a second place 10:27, and Peterman was third in 10:28.

2024 OCC Results: Hemming and Yao Win UTMB 50k World Series Final,"The 2024OCCrace started at 8:15 a.m. local time on Thursday, August 29. The race links up the towns of Orsières, Switzerland; Champex-Lac, Switzerland; and Chamonix, France — giving it the abbreviated OCC name. It is often referred to as the Little Swiss Sister ofUTMB. This year’s course matched the 2022 track and was longer than last year, when a rockslide closed a section of the traditional course. The official stats put the course at 57 kilometers (35 miles) with 3,500 meters (11,500 feet) of elevation gain across three big climbs. The race was the UTMB World Series Final for the 50k distance, and that meant €13,000 to each of the winners and prize money going 10 deep. The total OCC prize purse was €76,000. There were some 1,800 runners from 90 different countries in the race. The hot-weather kit requirements were activated for this year’s race, with temperatures climbing to 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit) range. Runners were required to add sunglasses, a Saharan cap, sunscreen, and extra water capacity to their normally required gear. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: Christian Allen(U.S.) opened a near-immediate gap on the field at the start and ran alone for nearly all of the race’s first half. Eli Hemming(U.S.),Benjamin Roubiol(France),Francesco Puppi(Italy), andRémi Bonnet(Switzerland) formed a strong initial chase pack that thinned to just Hemming and Bonnet 90 minutes into the race. At Trient, Switzerland, 15 miles and nearly two hours into the race, Allen led Hemming and Bonnet by two minutes. The race’s second of three big climbs went up Col de Balme, a mountain pass near the Swiss-French border, and here, Hemming dumped Bonnet and ran down Allen. Three hours into the race, Hemming was clear of the rest. Behind Hemming, Bonnet dropped after taking a fall, Allen hit a wall, andAntonio Martínez(Spain) made a huge move to leap into second on the Col de Balme climb, though still over six minutes behind the leader, however. He also ran a stirring second half at last year’s race when finishing third. Eli Hemming, the 2024 OCC men’s winner. All photos courtesy of UTMB. Puppi found the acceleration up the race’s third and final climb, returning to the lead group for the first time since early in the race. Puppi overtook Martínez to move into second and cut into Hemming’s lead. Hemming ran into trouble on that final climb, briefly stopping near mile 31, but recovered on the downhill finish to maintain his pole position to win in 5:11:48. Puppi was second in 5:14:46, and Martínez was third in 5:17:56. Hemming became the first American to win OCC, and Puppi and Martínez were both second and third for the second straight year. For perspective, in 2022 on this same course,Manuel Merillas(Spain) won in 5:18. Full results. The 2024 OCC men’s podium: (left-to-right) 2. Francesco Puppi, 1. Eli Hemming, 3. Antonio Martínez Tabor Hemming(U.S.) andDani Moreno(U.S.) led early, butMiao Yao(China) made an aggressive move to the lead on a downhill section less than an hour into the race to take the lead. The surge timing mirrored Yao’s push in last year’s race when she finished third. Yao’s time alone at the front was short-lived though, and Hemming regained the lead on the climb to La Giète, Switzerland, two hours into the race.Judith Wyder(Switzerland) also overtook Yao on the climb to move into second. When the course again turned downhill into Trient, Switzerland, Yao again charged. Yao, Wyder, and Hemming exited the Trient aid station, 24.3 kilometers into the race, together with two big climbs to go. Yao broke the group up on the Col de Balme climb, heading up to the course high point at 34 kilometers, and again blasted the downhill right after. She was three two minutes ahead of Wyder at the top, and Hemming would drop from the race further on. Yao led the rest of the race from there, and Wyder stayed in second, too. Miao Yao celebrates winning the 2024 OCC. Miao’s winning time was 5:54:03, and Wyder finished in 6:00:05.

2024 TDS Results: Dohin and Marquet Win for France,"Here we go! The weeklong group ofUTMBraces in Chamonix, France, is certainly the year’s biggest week of ultrarunning, and one of the first races is the 148-kilometerTDS. An acronym for Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, the TDS race left Courmayeur, Italy, with nearly 1,600 runners just before midnight local time on Monday, August 26, 2024, and gathered about 9,300 meters of elevation on its way to Chamonix. That’s about 92 miles and 30,500 feet of elevation gain. TDS is considered more technical than either of the longer UTMB orCCCraces and is on more remote trails. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: Ariane Wilhem(Switzerland) ran the downhill six miles from miles 51 to 57 seven minutes faster than then-leaderEmilie Collomb(Italy) to temporarily take the lead, but further backMarie Dohin(France) was full of run. Dohin climbed past Wilhem and into the lead heading up to Barrage de la Girotte at mile 66. Ten miles later, Dohin held a nine-minute lead over Wilhem, and the pair further separated from each other the rest of the way. Dohin, who was fifth at this race in 2021, was the race winner in 24:06, and Wilhem held onto a second-place finish in 24:42. Marie Dohin, the 2024 TDS women’s winner. All photos courtesy of UTMB. Despite a shorter course than last year’s rerouted race and with better weather this year, the winning time was around 30 minutes slower than in 2023. Céline Finaswas third in 25:41. French women took six of the top 10 finish positions. Full results. Ariane Wilhem, the 2024 TDS second-place woman. Thibault Marquet(France) hit the top of the Passeur Pralognan at mile 38 in a lead group alongsideAleksei Beresnev(competing as a neutral athlete) andAleix Toda Mas(Spain) and quickly separated from them over the next two downhill miles. Beresnev would fall way back, and Toda Mas would end up not finishing. Marquet led the race the rest of the way, and at the end, he was well clear of second place. Marquet dipped under the 19-hour mark with an 18:59:36 finish, running 37 minutes quicker thanChristian Meierdid when he won the 2023 race on a longer course and in snow. Marquet was 12th on the full UTMB course in 2022. Thibault Marquet, the 2024 TDS men’s winner. No one had a stronger second half than runner-upAlban Berson(France). Just inside the top 20 early on, Berson was still only in eighth at mile 45. He moved up quickly and held that second-place spot from mile 66 through the finish in 19:56:40. Berson raced UTMB in 2022, also finishing one spot behind Marquet in 13th. Alban Berson, the 2024 TDS second-place man. Gautier Airiau(France) overtook a fadingSimon Gosselin(France) with about 10 miles to go to move into third. Airiau finished in 20:07, and Gosselin did not finish. Airiau had a similar second-half charge to Berson. All of the top five finishers were French. Full results. Related articles:"
2024 Sierre-Zinal Results: Joyline Chepngeno Takes Surprise Win While Kilian Jornet Seals 10th Victory,"The 2024Sierre-Zinalmountain race was thrilling right until the athletes crossed the finish line.Joyline Chepngeno(Kenya) won the women’s race in a breakout performance, whileKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway) took his 10th win of the men’s race, and set a course record by the narrowest of margins. The race started at 11 a.m. local time on Saturday, August 10, in the village of Sierre, Switzerland, in the heart of the Valais Alps, and featured around 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) of elevation gain over 31 kilometers (19 miles). The event finishes in the village of Zinal. Sierre-Zinal is an iconic European mountain race and is also known as the ‘race of five 4,000s,’ as the course sits in view of five main Swiss peaks: Weisshorn (4,404 meters), Zinalrothorn (4,221 meters), Obergabelhorn (4,063 meters), Matterhorn (4,478 meters), and Dent Blanche (4,357 meters). Recently, we used data inthis articleto dive deep into the history and competition of Sierre-Zinal. The race was simultaneously part of the World Mountain Running Association (WMRA) World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series. It was a hot start to the day, with temperatures reaching 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) at the start line. There were clear blue skies throughout and dry conditions, with temperatures only getting warmer throughout the race. There was a shock win for Kenyan athlete Joyline Chepngeno, who had a huge lead throughout, despite it being her first ever trail race. Whilst Kilian Jornet won the race for the 10th time, he was pushed to his limits byPhilemon Ombogo Kiriago(Kenya), last year’s champion who attacked near the close of the race. Read on for the full race story. This year’s Sierre-Zinal’s biggest story surrounded the women’s winnerJoyline Chepngenoof Kenya, a true underdog in the race. This was Chepngeno’s first ever trail race. After the birth of her two children, Chepngeno lost 30 kilograms and decided to run again, and this was her spectacular debut to the world of trail running. Not only did Chepngeno win one of the most competitive trail races in the world, but she won by a huge margin. Right from the beginning, she took pole position in the women’s race, and extended her lead throughout. Joyline Chepngeno, the surprise winner of the 2024 Sierre-Zinal. Photo: World Mountain Running Association/Marco Gulberti There was some speculation as to whether Chepngeno was going to be able to maintain the lead, potentially going too hard at the start and unable to fend off more experienced athletes. However, she buried any of the doubts and dominated the women’s race to the end, finishing more than eight minutes clear of her closest competitor. Whilst Chepngeno took the lead, another ascendant athlete took second place.Scout Adkin(U.K.) was taking part in her longest trail race to date, however she’s been quickly rising through the WMRA World Cup ranks this summer, with prior top performances. She passed through the checkpoint at Ponchette (7.5 kilometers) in 59:29, one minute ahead of one of the race favorites,Joyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya). Scout Adkin takes second at the 2024 Sierre-Zinal. Photo: World Mountain Running Association/Marco Gulberti Running with Muthoni Njeru wasMonica Mădălina Florea(Romania), who recently took second at the 2024 Marathon du Mont Blanc. As the runners entered the next checkpoint at Chandolin, Muthoni Njeru overtook Adkin for second place, but this lead was seemingly short lived. On the descent to Tignousa at 16k, it looked as though Muthoni Njeru had overcooked it, and Adkin made a strong attack, retaining her second-place position. Adkin passed the checkpoint 29 seconds ahead of Muthoni Njeru. Florea continued to maintain her position in fourth a minute back, whilstPhilaries Jeruto Kisang(Kenya) came through in fifth a couple of minutes later. Unfortunately for Muthoni Njeru, she continued to fade, and this worked to Florea’s advantage. She overtook to take over third place around the 20k mark, now less than two minutes behind Adkin in second. As a powerful downhill runner, this was a chance for Florea to make up ground, but Adkin maintained her position all the way to the finish line. Joyline Chepngeno crossed the finish line in 2:54:06, taking a huge win. She was followed by Scout Adkin, who finished in 3:02:21, and Monica Mădălina Florea in third in 3:04:29. Philaries Jeruto Kisang moved up to fourth and finished in 3:05:52, andCristina Simion(Romania) finished fifth in 3:07:51. Joyce Muthoni Njeru dropped out of the top 10 and finished in 12th in 3:13:30. Monica Mădălina Florea celebrates third place at the 2024 Sierre-Zinal.

It was a bold but expected start to the race from favoriteKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway), who already had nine wins to his name on the revered route. He started at the front of the race and looked to have a significant gap on the rest of the field. Kilian Jornet winning the 2024 Sierre-Zinal in a sprint finish. Photo: World Mountain Running Association/Marco Gulberti However, at the Ponchette checkpoint, 7.5k in,Josphat Kiprotich(Kenya) had closed the gap and came through hot on Jornet’s heels. Switzerland’sRémi Bonnet, the 2022 and 2023 Golden Trail World Series overall winner, came through next, followed byPatrick KipngenoandPaul Machokaof Kenya. The first twist of the men’s race came shortly thereafter, when Kiprotich overtook Jornet. This is where the first battle at the front of the men’s race commenced and it was a cat-and-mouse chase between the two athletes, with Kiprotich running within 15 seconds of course record pace at the 12k mark. By halfway, Kiprotich still had a modest lead, coming through the checkpoint in 1:23:15, followed by Jornet in 1:24:01. Whilst the battle ensued for first, Kipngeno and Bonnet worked together to hold onto third and fourth positions, as they passed through the 16k mark together in 1:25:26.Philemon Ombogo Kiriago(Kenya), the 2023 Sierre-Zinal champion, had by now managed to overtake Machoka to move into fifth place. Philemon Ombogo Kiriago is all smiles after a second-place finish at the 2024 Sierre-Zinal. Photo: World Mountain Running Association/Marco Gulberti After the 20k mark, where most of the climbing had been completed, the race really became unpredictable. Jornet caught up with Kiprotich and they passed the 20k checkpoint in 1:43:17, but this is where Jornet made his attack. He created a 30-second lead on second place, and rolled along the trails whilst others battled it out behind. Although Kipngeno and Bonnet hit Hotel Weisshorn at the same time (1:45:03), it was Kipngeno who went for the attack and overtook Kiprotich for second place. But that wasn’t the end. Kipngeno’s training partner Ombogo Kiriago steamed ahead, and with a polite tap on the back, powered past Kipngeno and had his sights set on Jornet. On the technical descent toward the finish line, it looked like Jornet had a comfortable lead when Ombogo Kiriago came out of nowhere to overtake the nine-time winner and even gained on him. This was by far the biggest shock of the race, and it wasn’t long before Jornet drove down the descent hard to reclaim first position, but he had to work for it all the way to the finish line. Ombogo Kiriago was chasing hard, and the sprint finish through the streets of Zinal led Kilian Jornet to win and also take a new course record, finishing in 2:25:34, beating his previous 2019 course record by a single second. Philemon Ombogo Kiriago finished just behind in 2:25:36 and the two athletes collapsed as they crossed the line. Patrick Kipngeno held third position and crossed the line in 2:26:59, followed by Josphat Kiprotich in 2:31:35 in fourth, andRoberto Delorenzi(Switzerland) in 2:32:26 for fifth place. Paul Mochoka ultimately took sixth in 2:32:35, and Rémi Bonnet faded during the latter end of the race and dropped back to ninth position, crossing in 2:33:57.

"2024 Speedgoat by UTMB 50k Results: Sinclair Sets Record, Lowther Wins","The 2024Speedgoat by UTMB 50kkicked off at 6:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, July 20, high in Utah’s Wasatch Mountains at the famous Snowbird ski resort. Once all 32 miles (52 kilometers) and 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) of climbing were complete,David Sinclairhad a new course record, while Canada’sJazmine Lowtherled the women’s race from wire to wire. The weather was truly typical for a high-altitude summer day: fresh crispness in the morning, eventually yielding to a full sun whose heat always feels stronger at altitude. Sinclair’s no-contest treatment of both the course and the men’s field showed that he was far-and-away the best men’s runner of the day.Samuel Hendry’s(Canada) performance for second place, while holding that position for basically the whole race, was also dominant. And for Lowther, though the women’s race ran more closely, she, too, showed strength to stay ahead of a big chasing field, including significant pressure from second place byMali Noyes, who made her presence known in the second half of the race. Read on for more of this year’s Speedgoat 50k story. The start of the 2024 Speedgoat by UTMB 50k. Photo: Nils Nilsen It was a tight start to the men’s race, but that didn’t last long. Through the first checkpoint at mile four, a group of eight men rolled through within a minute of each other. Then, at about mile nine and the top of the first major climb, the summit of 11,000-plus-foot Hidden Peak, two men,David SinclairandSamuel Hendry(Canada), who would ultimately go one-two at the finish, passed through together, with more than two minutes on the rest of the field. Sinclair is familiar with this race, having finished it three times and won it twice before, as recently as 2022. Hendry, an elite cross-country skier and skilled shorter-distance trail runner, looked to be moving up in distance with this race. Behind them at mile nine, the top-10 men had strung out to within seven minutes of the lead. Among that group and pushing the pace wasAdam Peterman, a prior Speedgoat 50k champion and the then course record holder, andScott Patterson, a two-time Olympian in cross-country skiing and a mountain runner. From here on, though, it was the Sinclair show, as at each checkpoint, his gap on Hendry — as well as the rest of the field — increased. By mile 20 at the Mineral Basin checkpoint, on the backside of Snowbird ski resort, Sinclair’s lead was just shy of nine minutes, and it only extended from there. For the race’s final third, it was only the clock that Sinclair raced. When he crossed the line, after summiting Hidden Peak a second time, racking up a boatload of vertical, and taking the fast-and-furious descent back to the base of the ski resort, David Sinclair won in 4:57:35. This broke the previous course record of 5:04:31 set by Peterman in 2021. Sinclair also shaved over 11 minutes off his previous time when he won the race in 2022. David Sinclair on his way to winning and setting a course record at the 2024 Speedgoat 50k. Photo: Nils Nilsen Onto the rest of the men’s race. For as dominant as Sinclair was in first place, so was Hendry in second. By mile 20, Hendry had built a four-minute lead over the rest of the field, which he would hold at each aid station until the finish. Samuel Hendry ultimately crossed the finish line comfortably in second place in 5:24:57, with more than seven minutes on the next chasing man. At every single aid station, it was Patterson holding a strong third place. So when the Olympian Scott Patterson crossed the line in third with a time of 5:32:26, it should not have come as surprise ending. David Hedgestook fourth in 5:38:35 andGrant Barnettefifth in 5:45:56. Early pace pusher Peterman ultimately found his way to the finish in sixth.

While the women’s race for the win ran much more closely than in the men’s, Canada’sJazmine Lowthertook the lead from the get-go, never gave in as women ran closely behind her, and put the hammer down to crush the final descent — and the rest of the women’s field. Lowther was coming to this race after recovering from a longer-term injury that followed a pretty incredible couple years of ultrarunning, which saw her win the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k and take second at the 2023 Transgrancanaria. To look at Lowther’s lead over her closest chaser, as the race progressed, it bounced from about a minute at the first checkpoint at mile four and over Hidden Peak for the first time at mile nine, before growing to more than 3.5 minutes by mile 20. She gave back some of that time in the next five rough and verty miles, holding just an 80-second lead when she summited Hidden Peak for the second time at mile 25 and began the big descent to the finish. Over those final seven-ish miles, Lowther put six minutes on second place. That cracking descent from Jazmine Lowther ensured her victory and she crossed the finish line in 6:15:05. Jazmine Lowther, 2024 Speedgoat 50k champion. Photo: Nils Nilsen The race for the rest of the women’s top five was highly dynamic, with women moving around for much of the race. The closest chasers at the first checkpoint at mile four wereEmkay SullivanandMartina Valmassoi(Italy), the former of whom would remain dominant all race and the latter of whom would need to drop due to physical issues. After over 6,000 feet of climb since the start of the race, over the first summit of Hidden Peak at mile nine,Emily Caldwellalso made her presence known, passing over Hidden Peak in second place, with Sullivan right there in third. Over the next 11 miles, another runner presented herself a challenger,Mali Noyes, a prior two-time finisher who took second last year. The cross-country and downhill skier at least partially converted to trail running a few years ago, and has been racking up experience in American trail races. Noyes moved into second place for the women before mile 18 and then held it to the finish. Mali Noyes’s impressive climb up the leaderboard in the first half, before holding steady in the race’s second half, led her to finish in second place in 6:22:31. Much like Noyes in second place moved into that position before mile 18, so did ultimate women’s third-place finisherKodi Kleven. Kleven is a local runner, coach, and former collegiate runner who finished seventh at the 2022 Speedgoat 50k, so she was looking to move up this year. And also like Noyes, Kleven’s gap on the rest of the field stayed fairly close and fluctuated. For Kleven, her breakaway from the rest of the field took place on the beefy climb back up to Hidden Peak for a second time at mile 25. There, Kleven had carved out a fairly comfortable seven-minute lead, which she extended to 11 minutes by the finish line. Kodi Kleven crossed the finish line in 6:24:12 for third place. Emkay Sullivan ultimately finished fourth in 6:35:09.Lindsay Allisonalso moved up during the latter half of the race, finishing in fifth in 6:41:39.

2024 Hardrock 100 Results: Pommeret and Dauwalter Break Course Records and Claim Commanding Wins," It was,Ludovic Pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said, a dream when he kissed the rock at the end of the 2024Hardrock 100. He finished his lap around the San Juan Mountains of Colorado with a new overall course record of 21:33:06, breakingKilian Jornet’sprevious record, set in 2022, by just over three minutes. Pommeret, a 48-year-old Frenchman, led almost wire-to-wire in a commanding fashion. “I dream all the day,” Pommeret said at the iconic rock-kissing finish just past 3:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, July 13, 2024. “The nightmare never came.” Neither did it come for the women’s winnerCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who seems to redefine what is possible in ultrarunning every time she toes the line. Dauwalter won the women’s race in 26:11:49, setting a new overall women’s course record, breaking her own mark of 26:14:12set last yearas the second race ofher historic Western States 100-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple. That means Dauwalter, who also led essentially wire-to-wire, has set a course record the past three times she’s run and owns the fastest three women’s times. Courtney Dauwalter early in the 2024 Hardrock 100, on her way to a third victory at this race in course-record time. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell But before the two champions got back to the rock, there was a lot of running to do. At 6 a.m. local time on Friday, July 12, 146 runners set off in the predawn darkness under the watchful gaze of the San Juan Mountains in Silverton, Colorado, to begin one of the most famous, arduous, andscenically stunning100-mile races in the world. The Hardrock 100, famous for itsdifficultyandselectiveness, is a 102.5-mile trek featuring more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain and an average elevation of 11,000 feet through the rugged San Juans. It alternates directions every year, and this year’s race went clockwise. Starting in the smallminingtown of Silverton, runners made their way to Telluride before continuing on to Ouray and near Lake City and then returned to Silverton to kiss the iconic rock. The course, often impacted by snow, was mostly snow-free this year, and temperatures vacillated between sub-40 degrees and 80 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day and night. “It’s 100 miles. It’s huge mountains. It’s altitude,” Dauwalter said in her pre-race interview with iRunFar. “So, adventure is guaranteed for sure.” Read on for more details about that adventure. Thank you so much toTailwindfor sponsoring iRunFar’s coverage of the 2024 Hardrock 100! Thanks also toFractelfor sponsoring our race coverage. Entering the race, it was fair to wonder what droveCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) to return to the event again. Over the past two years, she’d won twice and set course records in both directions. But she was back, she said during her pre-race interview with iRunFar, because she still felt that she had left something on the course. “I am back because all of my runs here have had just really significant chunks of time that were spent in very low places,” she said. “I would love to try to smooth out those lows just a little bit, and see if I can get around that course without having so many huge hours.” And while she struggled with stomach issues for some of the second half of the run, she still reset the overall course record, breaking her previous clockwise record by more than 30 minutes. Dauwalter, whowon the Transgrancanaria 126kand the Mt. Fuji 100 Mile already this year, is so consistently dominant that her wins in major ultras can seem like a foregone conclusion. But Hardrock is never easy, and she still had to cover the 100-plus miles and 33,000-plus feet of elevation gain. Once again, she did it faster than any woman ever had before her, including herself. Katharina Hartmuth and Courtney Dauwalter enjoying the early miles of the 2024 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks France’sCamille Bruyas(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Germany’sKatharina Hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) posed the biggest challenges to Dauwalter. Both had finished second by Dauwalter at UTMB in 2021 and 2023, respectively, and both had spent the last few weeks in the U.S. acclimating to the high elevations and learning the terrain. While Dauwalter had opened a small gap on Bruyas at the Kamm Traverse aid station (mile 11) and maintained it through Chapman at mile 18, by Telluride at mile 28, Bruyas had closed the gap and came through in the co-lead with Dauwalter, two minutes under course record pace. Dauwalter slowly began to pull away — five minutes up at Kroger’s Canteen at mile 33 and six minutes by Ouray at mile 44 — before making a strong move to increase her lead over Bruyas to 31 minutes by mile 52. At that point, just over halfway, it was Dauwalter, followed by Bruyas, Hartmuth,Tara Dower(pre-race interview), and France’sClaire Bannwarthrounding out the top five. Katharina Hartmuth runs into the town of Ouray on her way to taking third at the 2024 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi From there, Dauwalter continued to run alone. Smiling and moving swiftly in a bright yellow shirt, she was 18 minutes under course-record pace by Animas Forks aid station at mile 58, making quick work of the aid station and picking up her pacer. One of the few signs of fatigue she showed all race was at the Sherman aid station at mile 73, after climbing and descending from Handies Peak, the course’s high point at 14,058 feet. She stayed for five minutes to rest and refuel before running on into the dark. By Maggie Gulch at mile 87, she was nearly an hour under course-record pace and looked strong. Six miles later, at Cunningham Gulch, she picked up her husband as her pacer as they made their way up and over the final climb. Less than three hours later and now in the early-morning sun, Dauwalter returned to the rock, and kissed it once more. Behind her, Hartmuth, who was nursing a bruised sacrum from a fall three weeks prior, had closed the gap on Bruyas during the mid-race miles to as little as 13 minutes by Sherman at mile 73. Eye issues slowed Hartmuth later in the race, causing blurry vision and slow movement, and Bruyas doubled her lead by Pole Creek at mile 81. Bruyas took an 18-minute stop at the Maggie Gulch aid station at mile 87 to refuel and get warm, while Hartmuth, who was also feeling the miles, also took an extended break. Camille Bruyas running into the town of Ouray, before the halfway point of the 2024 Hardrock 100. After helping to push the pace for the lead for over 40 miles, she’d go on to take second place. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Camille Bruyas battled through the rest of the race to finish second in 29:28:11, and Hartmuth, after a long stop at Cunningham Gulch (mile 93) to get warm under a blanket and deal with her deteriorating vision, finished third in 30:29:12. The race for the top five behind them was perhaps the closest of the day. After saying she had thrown up eight times, Dower, just three years into her ultrarunning career, battled to catch up to Bannwarth by Maggie Gulch at mile 87. Bannwarth, who was visibly struggling, fell off the pace, while Dower flew along in pursuit of a spot in the top five. Tara Dower at the 2024 Hardrock 100. After a strong first half, she struggled with her stomach over the course high point on Handies Peak, but got her stomach back and rallied into fourth place with a late-race surge. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By Cunningham Gulch at mile 93, the three women in contention for positions three through five —Yitka Winn,Emily Halnon, and Dower — were separated by only 16 minutes. All three made short stops at the aid station before continuing. Between Cunningham Gulch and the final descent at mile 97, Halnon made a move. She passed Winn to move into fourth place, making up more than 20 minutes in less than six miles. Dower, meanwhile, put in a huge move of her own on the rocky final descent and also passed Winn, with the gap growing visibly in a very short distance. Therein, perhaps, lies the beauty of Hardrock and ultras in general: After almost 100 miles of racing, the battle for the top five came down to two moves made on the final descent and the final rolling miles into the streets of Silverton. In the end, Tara Dower held onto fourth in 33:10:55, Yitka Winn finished fifth in 33:17:00, and Emily Halnon came in looking absolutely ecstatic in sixth with a time of 33:24:22.

Camille Bruyas taking second at the 2024 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The first significant news in the men’s field came a week before the race began. AmericanZach Miller, who wassecond in last year’s UTMBand had put ina monster training blockin preparation for Hardrock, was among the favorites, but did not race following an emergency appendectomy on July 5. Ever the optimist and making the most of a disappointing situation, Miller spent part of Saturday morningmaking his patented donuts for fans. Along with Miller, France’sFrançois D’Haene(pre-race interview) was expected to contend for the win, even if he had been coming back from injury and not feeling 100% leading up to race day due to an illness a few weeks ahead of time. D’Haene, one of the best runners in the world at long mountainous ultras, set the counter-clockwise course record for the win in 2021 before placing second behindKilian Jornetin 2022 in the clockwise direction. Entering the race, D’Haene had two of the fastest three times in race history. From right to left, it’s Ludo Pommeret, François D’Haene, and Diego Pazos in the early miles of the 2024 Hardrock 100. Pommeret and Pazos would finish one-two, while D’Haene would be forced to drop after midway. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell And whileLudovic Pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was certainly expected to be among the top contenders this year, it’s probably fair to say he was not the favorite. But once the race began, the Frenchman made his intentions clear. Pommeret, who was running his first full Hardrock after pacing for last year’s winnerAurélien Dunand-Pallaz, arrived in Silverton on June 14 and completed two laps of the course as multi-day trips, otherwise known as Softrocks, as part of a month-long training block to acclimatize to the altitude and mountains. That fitness and preparation were clear from the moment the race began when Pommeret led a pack of runners, including D’Haene,Jason Schlarb(post-race interview), and Switzerland’sDiego Pazos(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) through the Rainbow Trail at mile 1.5.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks At Kamm Traverse (mile 11), Pommeret, D’Haene, and Pazos all came through in the lead together. By mile 28, when Pommeret entered Telluride in 5:34 elapsed, he was two minutes below course-record pace, with D’Haene 2.5 minutes behind him. Then began the famous 4,300-foot ascent to Kroger’s Canteen aid station, which sits at 13,100 feet above sea level at mile 33. Pommeret came through in the lead again, smiling and drinking Coke before leaving after only a minute. D’Haene was still close behind, and Schlarb — whotied Jornet for the win at Hardrockin 2016 and has been recovering from a torn ACL from a skiing accident two years ago — came through in third, 32 minutes off the lead. “It’s hard to feel good up here,” Schlarb said, drinking only water and leaving quickly. Pazos, who has several strong finishes at UTMB, came across the iconic pass four minutes behind Schlarb. Jason Schlarb running strong into Chapman aid station, 18 miles into the 2024 Hardrock 100. He would ultimately take third place. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi It was on the descent to Ouray that Pommeret began to open up a gap. By Ouray (mile 44), the gap to D’Haene, who began to show signs of fatigue on a hot, humid section of the course, was 23 minutes. It was a stark contrast to Pommeret, who looked as smooth as ever. At just over the halfway mark (mile 52), the top four men were Pommeret, D’Haene at 62 minutes off the lead, Schlarb just two minutes behind him, and Pazos a further 11 minutes back. By Animas Forks at mile 58, Pommeret had increased his lead to 1 hour and 24 minutes, and Schlarb, despite puking, and Pazos had passed D’Haene, who was sadly in tears at the aid station. D’Haene dropped from the race soon after, saying, “You don’t know if you don’t play.” He was clearly still feeling the after-effects of an illness just 10 days prior. Pommeret continued cruising. He looked smooth and efficient at the next several aid stations, refueling quickly before continuing his record day. At the Sherman aid station at mile 73, now 22 minutes ahead of course-record pace, Pommeret was animated and sprinted away after a three-minute stop, less than 20 miles from history. Almost exactly seven hours later — after three more characteristically short stops at the remaining aid stations — Pommeret made history, running the final few steps in the cold dark before hugging the rock that had awaited him for the past 21-plus hours. He was officially a Hardrock champion and course-record holder. Pommeret’s win is a testament to his longevity: He ran his first UTMB 20 years ago,won it in 2016, and now, eight years later, has won Hardrock. Both D’Haene and Miller were at the finish line to congratulate the new champion. After D’Haene dropped, the battle for second was between Schlarb and Pazos. Schlarb was in front by 13 minutes at mile 62.5, but Pazos looked determined to reel him in. By Sherman at mile 73, Schlarb reported that he had been cramping for most of the race, while Pazos, who quietly devoured a cup of noodles, had cut into his lead.

Pazos had turned a nine-minute deficit into a six-minute lead. That order would remain until the finish, with Diego Pazos taking second in 24:39:33 and Jason Schlarb coming in third in 24:48:13. Jeff Rome, thesecond-place finisher in 2018who lives just blocks away from the start of the race and was quoting J.R.R.

2024 Western States 100 Results: Walmsley Wins a Fourth Time While Schide Rocks the Women’s Field,"For hours,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) chased ghosts. For hours,Jim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andRodFarvard(post-race interview) chased each other. And in the end, after 100 courageous, gutsy miles at one of the world’s most iconic ultramarathons, it was Schide and Walmsley who won a fast, dramatic 2024Western States 100. Schide, an American who lives in France, was on pace to break the course record until late in the race, while Americans Walmsley and Farvard battled throughout most of the second half of the race, alternating the lead as late as mile 85. Schide’s winning time was 15:46:57, just over 17 minutes behindCourtney Dauwalter’s2023 course record, almost an hour faster than her own time last year, and the second fastest women’s time ever. Walmsley, meanwhile, won his fourth Western States in 14:13:45, the second fastest time ever — only behind his own record of 14:09:28 that heset in 2019. Second and third in the men’s race came down to an epic sprint finish on the track between Farvard andHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who finished in 14:24:15 and 14:24:31, respectively. In the women’s race for the podium,Fu-Zhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished second in 16:20:03, andEszter Csillag(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took third for the second time in a row, in 16:42:17. Both races featured one of the deepest and most competitive fields in race history, with the men’s top five all coming in faster than last year’s winning time, and the women’s top 10 finishing just under 40 minutes faster than last year’s incredibly competitive top 10. At 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 29, they were all among the 375 runners who began the historic route from Olympic Valley to Auburn, California, traversing 100.2 miles of trail with 18,000 feet of elevation gain and 22,000 feet of loss. After last year’s cool temperatures, the weather at this year’s race was a bit warmer, albeit with a notable lack of snow in the high country. The high temperature in Auburn was in the low 90s Fahrenheit. A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible! Thanks also toFractelfor sponsoring our race coverage. Read on for the full race story. The start of the 2024 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell In his return to the race that propelled him to the heights of global trail running and his first ultra on American soil in three years,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) demonstrated why he is, once again, the king of Western States. Before the race, Walmsley exuded a calmness that perhaps eluded him during his first attempts, when he attacked it with an obsessive intensity that led him to famously take a wrong turn and then dropping out in back-to-back years. “We’ll just roll with what plays out and just kind of see what happens in the race,” he said in hispre-race interview. There’s a marked difference when compared to his remarks from hisinterviewbefore the 2016 race. What happened in the race was this: In his fourth Western States,Rod Farvard(post-race interview) had the race of his life to push Walmsley like he’d never been pushed before in his long history with the event. Farvard — a 28-year-old from Mammoth Lakes, California, who has improved his finish each year at the race, from a DNF in 2021 to 41st place in 2022 to 11th place last year — put himself in a strong position from the start, leading a large pack of runners that included Walmsley at the top of the Escarpment, the 2,500-foot climb in the first four miles of the race. For the next 45-plus miles, Farvard remained in the top 10, part of a chase pack of AmericanHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), KiwiDan Jones(pre-race interview), and Chinese runnerGuo-Min Deng, among others. Dan Jones (left) and Hayden Hawks rolling through Robinson Flat during the 2024 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At the Robinson Flat aid station at mile 30 — the symbolic end of the runners’ time in the high country, which features an average elevation of around 7,000 feet — Walmsley, who started the race conspicuously wearing all black, came through in 4:24 looking fast and smooth, now wearing an ice-soaked white shirt. Jones,the 2024 Tarawera 102k championand fifth-place finisher in his Western States debut last year, and Hawks,who set the course record at February’s Black Canyons 100kafter dropping out of last year’s Western States, followed about 90 seconds later. The two runners, frequent training partners, ran together frequently throughout the day, with Hawks often foregoing ice at aid stations. After the trio of Walmsley, Hawks, and Jones went through Last Chance at mile 43 together, Walmsley put nearly two minutes on them up the climb to Devil’s Thumb. “I was with everybody at the bottom,” he said, according to the race’s official livestream. About halfway through, at mile 49.5, the order remained the same: Walmsley in the lead with an elapsed time of 6:58, followed by Jones one minute back, Hawks two minutes back, and Farvard just over two and a half minutes back. The rest of the top 10 were last year’s 17th-place finisherDakota Jones;2024 Transvulcania UltramarathonchampionJon Albon(pre-race interview), who is from the U.K. but lives in Norway; 2023 fourth-place finisherJia-Sheng Shen(China) (pre-race interview);2023 Canyons 100kchampionCole Watson; Western States specialistTyler Green(pre-race interview); andJupiter Carera(Mexico). Cole Watson (left, in orange) and Tyler Green (right) running through Robinson Flat. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Then began a thrilling, chaotic second half of the race — featuring a gripping back-and-forth between Walmsley and Farvard, a wildfire near the course, a two-man river crossing, and a sprint finish on the track. It all started when Walmsley entered Michigan Bluff at mile 55, again looking calm and in control, changing shirts and getting doused with ice. Farvard came in just behind him and left the aid station first, leading the race for the first time since the first climb up the Escarpment. The same routine took place seven miles later at Foresthill: Walmsley entering first, Farvard leaving first. Rod Farvard finishing the climb to Michigan Bluff in second during the 2024 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell For the next 18 miles, the two runners alternated in the lead. By mile 78, they were so close that they were crossing the American River at the same time. Their battle underscored the overall depth of the field at this year’s race: At mile 80, the top five men were within 16 minutes of one another. Rod Farvard crossing the American River in first with Jim Walmsley on the far bank. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Around then, the 15-acre Creek Fire, which started not long before, was visible from the final quarter of the course and crews were temporarily not permitted to travel to the Green Gate aid station at mile 80 because the route to it passed close to the fire. Eventually, a reroute was established for crews to get to Green Gate and, later, after the wildfire was controlled, the regular route was reopened. At Green Gate, Farvard came through in the lead, with Walmsley four minutes back and looking like he was hurting. It was then, perhaps, that the thought entered people’s minds: Could Farvard really take down the champ? But Jim Walmsley is Jim Walmsley for a reason, and he again proved why he is among the world’s best. Against the ropes, facing one of his first real challenges in the race that shaped him, he delivered, entering the next aid station, Auburn Lake Trails at mile 85, more than a minute earlier than Farvard. He had made up five minutes in five miles. Walmsley never trailed again, increasing his lead to 11 minutes by the Pointed Rocks aid station at mile 94 and then picking up his crew, including his wife,Jess Brazeau, at Robie Point to run the final mile with him. He entered the track at Placer High School to loud cheers, his loping stride still looking smooth, stopping a few steps short of the tape to wave to the crowd and raise his arms in triumph. He had done it again. Jim Walmsley, 2024 Western States 100 champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Behind him, Farvard was fading but determined to cap an extraordinary race with a second-place finish. Hawks, who had made up five minutes on Farvard in the couple miles between Pointed Rocks and Robie Point, was on the hunt, and by the time he stepped on the track, Farvard was within sight. It was then that fans were treated to one of the most unique sights in all of ultrarunning: After 100 miles of racing, two men were sprinting against each other on a track. In the end, Farvard’s lead held, and he finished 16 seconds ahead of Hawks. He collapsed at the finish line — a fitting end to an epic performance. Dan Jones ended a strong race with a fourth-place finish in 14:32:29, withCaleb Olsoncapping an impressive second half of the race — from 11th at mile 53 to fifth in 14:40:12 at the finish. All five men ran a time that would have won the race last year. Dan Jones being aggressively cooled down by his pacer during the river crossing. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Behind Olson came Jon Albon, running 14:57:01 in his 100-mile running-race debut, followed by the surgical Tyler Green, who finished in seventh for his fourth straight top 10 finish at the race. Green’s time of 15:05:39 also marked a new men’s masters course record, breaking the 2013Mike Mortonrecord of 15:45:21. Rounding out the top 10 were Jia-Sheng Shen in eighth with a time of 15:09:49,Jonathan Reain ninth who methodically moved his way up during the last 60 miles to finish in 15:13:10; andChris Myersin 10th in 15:18:25.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Through the high country, into and out of the canyons, and along the river of the world’s oldest 100-mile trail race,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) raced only the ghosts of the clock and history. Smiling throughout, she seemed unaffected by the solitude and the enormity of the possibility that lay before her: to attempt to break the course record of one of the world’s most iconic trail races. Schide, an American who lives in France, came into the race as the clear favorite, and for good reason: She finished second last year, breakingEllie Greenwood’spreviously untouchable 2012 course record by more than three minutes and losing to onlyCourtney Dauwalter, who broke Greenwood’s record by an astounding 78 minutes on her way to a historic Western States-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple win. Schide, winner of the 2022 UTMB and 2023 Diagonale des Fous 100 Mile, spent the last two-and-a-half months in Flagstaff, Arizona, training for Western States, winning this year’s Canyons 100k in an impressive tune-up and putting ina monster training block. In her pre-race interview, Schide said that she had thought about ways to improve her race from last year, which perhaps should have been the first warning to her competition. The second, then, was her immediate separation from the women’s chase pack: She summited the Escarpment, a 2,500-foot climb during the first four miles, in first place and never looked back. By the first aid station — Lyon Ridge at 10 miles — she was already 12 minutes under course record pace, and by Robinson Flat at mile 30, she was 21 minutes ahead of second-placeEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview), from Zimbabwe but living in the U.S. Katie Schide in control in the high country at Robinson Flat during the 2024 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The lead only ballooned from there. By Dusty Corners at mile 38, Schide was an incredible 26 minutes under course record pace, and though she lost a few minutes from that pace by the time she climbed up to Michigan Bluff at mile 55, her smile had not waned even slightly. She smoothly entered the iconic aid station, doused herself with ice, changed shirts, and was soon on her way. She never sat down. Twenty-seven minutes behind her was Hawgood, looking to build on back-to-back fifth-place finishes.Eszter Csillag(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), a Hungarian who lives in Hong Kong, followed soon after, in the same third spot she finished in last year.

Ida Nilsson running her way back into next year’s Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At the halfway point, the top 10 were Schide, 33 minutes up in an elapsed time of 7:26; Csillag; Hawgood; Chinese runnerFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the fourth-place finisher at last year’s UTMB;Lin Chen(China); AmericanHeather Jackson, a versatile former triathlete who recently finished fifth at a competitive 200-mile gravel bike race; ultrarunning veteranIda Nilsson(pre-race interview), a Swede living in Norway;Becca Windell, second in this year’s Black Canyon 100k;2023 CCCwinnerYngvild Kaspersen(Norway); andRachel Drake, running her 100-mile debut. Schide, easily identifiable in her pink shirt, maintained her large lead throughout the second half of the race, remaining calm, controlled, and upbeat throughout the tough canyon miles. By Foresthill at mile 62, she was 19 minutes ahead of course record pace and 48 minutes ahead of the second-place Xiang. Schide’s stride still looked smooth as she waved to fans and even high-fived a cameraman. Schide’s aggressive pace eventually slowed — by Green Gate at mile 80, her lead on the course record had dissipated — but her spirits did not. After a quick sponge bath at Auburn Lake Trails aid station at mile 85, she fell behind course-record pace for the first time all day, only 15 miles remained until the finish. Schide entered the track a couple of hours later, running with her crew and no headlamp. She would finish before dark. She stopped for a hug on the final straightaway and lifted the tape with, of course, a smile. Katie Schide, 2024 Western States 100 champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Xiang had methodically pulled away from Hawgood and Csillag during an incredibly strong second half to win the battle for second. Fu-Zhao Xiang finished in 16:20:03 for the third fastest time in race history. Chen, who dropped out at mile 78, was one of the few elite runners who had a DNF on this day, which was categorized by a lack of attrition in both the women’s and men’s elite races. Eszter Csillag came in about 22 minutes behind Xiang in 16:42:17 for her second consecutive third-place finish, a 30-minute improvement from last year — a statistic that perhaps exemplifies the speed of this year’s race better than any other. Eszter Csillag enjoying(?) her crossing of the American River. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The battle for fourth and fifth was nearly as close as Farvard and Hawks’s race for second in the men’s race a couple of hours earlier. At Pointed Rocks at mile 94, Hawgood led by barely two minutes, running hard and straight through the aid station. Kaspersen, meanwhile, was drinking Coke and made up almost a minute by Robie Point. Western States rookie Yngvild Kaspersen ran a smart race en route to placing fifth. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Emily Hawgood’s lead ultimately held, and she finished fourth in 16:48:43 to improve her finish from prior years by one spot. Yngvild Kaspersen was less than two minutes back in 16:50:39. Ida Nilsson capped a strong day to finish sixth in 16:56:52 and breakRagna Debats’smasters course record by almost 45 minutes. That means the top six women all finished in under 17 hours in a race that had only ever had three women finish under that mark — and two of them, Dauwalter and Schide, were last year. The rest of the top 10 were Heather Jackson in seventh in 17:16:43, and, in close succession, Rachel Drake in 17:28:35,Priscilla Forgie(Canada) in 17:30:24, andLeah Yinglingin 17:33:54. The top 10 women were all faster than the 12th-fastest time in race history going into the day. Leah Yingling making her way across the American River. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results.

2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k Results: Njeru and Kipngeno Lead From Start To Finish,"With start-to-finish dominance, Kenyan athletesJoyce Muthoni NjeruandPatrick Kipngenotook first place at the 2024Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k. The 2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k took place on Sunday, June 23, and was part of the weekend of the Broken Arrow Skyrace festival, including a Vertical Kilometer, 11k, 18k, the Ironface Challenge, and 46k races. After last year’s route was cut short due to poor weather conditions, this year, there was much less snow and a cloudless, warm morning — the stage was set for an exciting race. The start of the 2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace. Photo: Scott Rokis Photography The race is 21.75 kilometers (13.5 miles) long and has 1,433 meters (4,700 feet) of vertical gain. It takes place in the Palisades Tahoe ski area, where the legendary Western States 100 begins next Saturday, and routes itself on the resort’s more technical paths. This race was the season opener for the 2024World Mountain Running Association World Cup, as was the Vertical Kilometer race, which took place two days prior. Last year’s winners of the women’s and men’s races,Allie McLaughlinandEli Hemming, took part in this year’s event, so the pressure may have been on them to retain their titles. In the end, the Kenyan athletes reigned supreme. Plus, the drama and close racing continued to the finish lines, especially in the women’s race. Read on for the full story. The first three miles of the race are the fastest and most runnable part of the course, making it a quick start.Joyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya) was first to the Snow King checkpoint at 4.6 miles in 40:23. She held a just-under-two-minute lead onTabor Hemming, who passed the checkpoint in 42:03. Less than one minute behind second place was last year’s winnerAllie McLaughlin(43:11) in third followed shortly byJade Belzbergin fourth andDani Morenoin fifth. There may have been a small gap at the front of the race between the leader and the rest of the field, but the competition remained fierce between second through fifth places and beyond.

The women’s race remained steady as the runners held their positions. Njeru increased her lead by another minute (1:21:12) against Hemming (1:24:08), setting her up well for the race’s second half. McLaughlin closed the gap in third place (1:24:59) while the race remained tight, with Belzberg only 30 seconds back in fourth. Moreno (1:28:15) ran in fifth. After descending into Shirley Basin, the runners next climbed 550 feet back up to checkpoint three at the High Camp aid station at 10.5 miles. It was during the ascent that Belzberg started to make her attack. Njeru (1:44:50) and Hemming (1:47:22) remained in first and second as they passed the checkpoint, but Belzberg overtook McLaughlin, taking over the third-place position in 1:48:15. However, the gap remained tight with McLaughlin reaching High Camp at 1:48:53 and Moreno three minutes behind at 1:52:00. Jade Belzberg all smiles on an ascent.

Jade Belzberg made up a lot of time on the steep descent to finish in second place, just over 30 seconds behind Njeru in 2:12:29. It was an incredible race for the athlete who managed to take a podium spot in the last few miles of the route. Tabor Hemming came through the finish in third in 2:13:31, while last year’s winner, Allie McLaughlin, finished in 2:14:53 for fourth place. Dani Moreno maintained fifth place in 2:17:04. It was an exciting end for the women’s top positions. Tabor Hemming on her way to taking third at the 2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k. Photo: Jonathan Wyatt Full results.

However, it was Kenyan athletePatrick Kipngenowho took the lead into checkpoint one, setting a tone for the day. Kipngeno came in at 32:49, one minute faster than Hemming. He was followed shortly after by Kenyan athletePhilemon Ombogo Kiriago(34:15) andTaylor Stack,who remained close behind in third and fourth. Just 30 seconds later,Meikael Beaudoin-Rousseauentered the first checkpoint at 35:24, a spread of about 2.5 minutes for the top five men.

Situated just after the race’s highest peak, athletes face a challenging climb, scrambling at the top, followed by a steep descent. Next to the checkpoint were Kiriago, Stack, and Beaudoin-Rousseau. There was less drama in the men’s race, with no significant changes as Kipngeno managed to hold onto his lead on the last incline to the High Camp aid station, passing the checkpoint at 1:23:24 and Hemming at 1:25:21, still taking a two-minute lead on last year’s champion, the same gap as at the prior checkpoint. Another two minutes later, Kiriago crossed through at 1:27:13, followed by Stack (1:28:30) and Beaudoin-Rousseau (1:29:59). It was no surprise that Patrick Kipngeno took first place, crossing the finish line in 1:45:37, followed by Eli Hemming in 1:47:00 for second place.

2024 Comrades Marathon Results: Gerda Steyn Sets Course Record; Piet Wiersma Wins Men’s Race,"At 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, June 9, in the raucous darkness of Durban, South Africa, more than 20,000 runners, powered by nerves, adrenaline, and the “Chariots of Fire” theme song, crossed the start line of the 2024Comrades Marathonto take part in the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world: nearly 86 kilometers of road running throughout the hills of South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province. It was the 97th running of the event, which has only missed four editions since World War I veteranVic Claphamstarted it in 1921 to commemorate the lives of South African soldiers. Elite women before the start of the 2024 Comrades Marathon. Eventual champ Gerda Steyn is at center left. Photo: Comrades Marathon/Paul Henman Two of the runners —Gerda Steyn, of South Africa but who lives in the United Arab Emirates, on the women’s side andPietWiersmaof The Netherlands on the men’s — cemented their names in race lore by taking home wins, and sizable paydays, in their respective races. The race has a massive prize purse, with a total 4,092,000 Rand ($217,000) on the line. Steyn, the defending champion, broke her own course record for the Up run direction by more than nine minutes for her third win at Comrades. She also holds the women’s course record for the Down run when the race is held in the opposite direction, which she set in 2023. Wiersma, meanwhile, backed up his impressive Comrades debut last year — where he finished second only three seconds behind the winner — with his first win at the race. The Comrades Marathon famously alternates the direction each year, and this year’s race, which was run in relatively ideal conditions with temperatures ranging from the mid-50s to low-70s Fahrenheit, was the 49th Up race, meaning runners began in the lower-altitude Durban and ended in the higher-altitude Pietermaritzburg. The race featured around 1,750 meters of elevation gain, with most of it during the first half of the race, when the course runs through three of its “Big Five” hills. The Up run, therefore, demands a smart, measured racing strategy. Read on for full race details. The 2024 Comrades Marathon top three men and women at the post-race press conference (l-to-r): 3rd man Degefa Yohannese Lafebo, 2nd man Dan Moselakwe, 1st man Piet Wiersma, 1st woman Gerda Steyn, 2nd woman Alexandra Morozova, and 3rd woman Courtney Olsen. Photo: Comrades Marathon For the race’s first half,PietWiersma(The Netherlands) seemed content to stay conservative and save his energy for the back half. A two-man pack ofJobo Khatoane(Lesotho), looking for his first Comrades finish, andAleksei Beresnev(Russia), back for a second time after debuting inside the top 10 last year, were within a minute of each other at Drummond, around the halfway mark, with the next runner more than five minutes back and Wiersma sitting in 10th, almost nine-and-a-half minutes off the lead. But then Wiersma dropped the hammer, increasing his pace to 3:37 per kilometer from 3:58 per kilometer to jump into the top five by the Cato Ridge checkpoint at 56.6 kilometers into the race. That seemingly set the tone for big moves for the race’s second half, where Beresnev was still holding the lead and followed byDegefa Yohannese Lafebo(Ethiopia). With this race, Lafebo was moving up in distance following two top-10 finishes at the Two Oceans Marathon, a 50k race. South AfricansTete Dijana, the two-time defending champion, andDan Moselakwe, a prior Comrades podium finisher, sat in third and fourth, respectively. Wiersma continued to run strong and moved into the lead by Umlaas Road, 67.5k, passing Lafebo, and by Mkondeni at 79.1k, he had increased to nearly a minute. Behind him, Beresnev dropped off the pace, while Dijana couldn’t hang on, either. The pair would finish, but outside the top 10 this year. Moselakwe took advantage of fading runners to move himself into second.Joseph Manyedi(South Africa), meanwhile, methodically moved his way up to finish in fourth, his eighth and best Comrades finish, whileAndrew Davies(U.K.) jumped from 12th to fifth over the course of the second half of the race. This was Davies’ first Comrades finish. At the finish line, Wiersma would stay clear of Moselakwe by 45 seconds and third-place finisher Lafebo by nearly three minutes.

Gerda Steyn(South Africa, lives in the United Arab Emirates), who won the Comrades Marathon in 2023 and 2019 and is also set to run the Olympic Marathon in Paris, France, later this summer, was at or near the front of the race from the beginning. At the 5.5k and Pinetown (18.5k) checkpoints, she sat in a group withCarla Molinaro(U.K.) andLoveness Madziva(Zimbabwe). Molinaro was a six-time Comrades finisher with her best performance last year in third place, and Madziva was looking for her first Comrades finish after lots of strong performances around the 50k distance. Those three women led a tight pack of runners through Winston Park (29.6k), with the top 10 women all within six minutes of the lead. But then Steyn picked up her pace by four seconds per kilometer to gap Madziva by almost a minute by Drummond (42.6k), about halfway into the race. By then, the 10th-place runner was more than 10 minutes back of Steyn. Steyn’s lead only increased over the latter half of the race, but behind her, there was significant movement within the field.Alexandra Morozova(Russia), the 2022 champion and a many-time Comrades podium finisher, made a big move between the Umlaas Road (67.5k) and Mkondeni (79.1k) checkpoints, dropping her pace by nearly 10 seconds per kilometer to pass Molinaro andNobukhosi Tshuma(Zimbabwe) and jump from fourth to second, a position she wouldn’t relinquish. Tshuma was another runner looking to move up in distance after successful shorter-distance ultrarunning. Perhaps the most dramatic move, though, came from AmericanCourtney Olsen, who methodically made her way into the lead pack throughout the race. By Drummond, she was in ninth place before jumping three spots at Umlaas Road. As Pietermaritzburg approached, Olsen jumped three more spots to finish third. Olsen’s incredible debut Comrades follows up on prior top-five finishes at the IAU 50k and 100k World Championships. No one, though, could get close to Steyn, who raised her arms in triumph as she broke the tape under a cloudless blue sky and took a small bow, setting a new women’s Up run record and finishing more than 15 minutes ahead of second-place Morozova.

2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results: Jon Albon and Ruth Croft Win,"The 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon getting underway. All photos courtesy of race. TheTransvulcania Ultramarathonis well-known for bringing in talented runners worldwide and being a highly competitive race. The 2024 edition was no different. Early on the morning of Saturday, May 11, racers set off on their 72-kilometer (44.7 miles) journey, starting at the southern tip of La Palma island, one of the Canary Islands, at the lighthouse of El Faro de Fuencaliente. The race’s finish line is set on the island’s west side in the city of Los Llanos de Aridane. Racers had to use their strength as they accumulated around 14,000 feet (4,350 meters) of gain. The course is as beautiful as it is challenging. Aside from the seemingly non-stop climbs to the course’s high point just after 50k and a 1,000-foot (320-meter) climb from the ocean to the finish, racers must somehow manage the nearly 8,000-foot (2,400 meters) descent from the high point to the ocean over the course of less than 11 miles (18k). Dominated by singletrack, the course tackles challenging terrain, including loose volcanic pumice and sharp lava rock. Five years after attempting the Transvulcania Ultramarathon and coming in fourth place,Jon Albonfinally found his way back to the island of La Palma. He claimed his crown, winning the 2024 edition. On the women’s side,Ruth Croftalso found her way back to the island, in her case eight years had passed. She made up for the lost years and not only came away with the victory but also the women’s course record. Read on for more of how the race played out. There were no fewer than 9 previous Transvulcania wins represented on the start line, including Dakota Jones (left, 2 wins) and Luis Alberto Hernando (right, 3 wins). The men’s race was one that wouldn’t be lost early, as at least 10 men rolled into the second aid station at Deseadas (17k) within 73 seconds of the lead. There was a distinct lead pack withJeshurun SmallandDakota Jonesof the U.S.,Tom EvansandJon Albonof the U.K, andThibaut Baronianof France.Ben Stout(U.S.),Dimtry Mityaev(Andorra),Davide Cheraz(Italy), andAntoine Thiriat(France) were all within a minute of the lead. Fourteen kilometers later, at El Reventón (31k), four of the five essentially remained in the lead pack, with only Jones dropping back to sixth while Stout moved up into fifth at 2.5 and 2 minutes off the lead, respectively. Technically, Baronian was 19 seconds off the lead trio of Albon, Small, and Evans. Cheraz,Ionel Manole(Romania, living in Spain), Mityaev, andTobias Geiser(Italy) rounded out the top 10. Fast forward to the high point at El Roque de los Muchachos (51k), and we finally started to see some gaps between the top men, even if that was mostly Albon pulling away from the rest of the leaders. Indeed, Albon hit el Roque with a 4.5-minute lead on Small and a 5.5-minute lead on Mityaev, while Baronian and Evans sat 6 minutes back. Jon Albon in the lead in La Palma’s high country. From there, gaps quickly grew with Stout at 8.5 minutes, Manole at 18 minutes, andManuel Anguita(Spain) at 19.5 minutes back in sixth through eighth as the only other runners within 20 minutes of the lead. Not long after El Reventón, Jones quickly fell behind the lead pack to eventually finish in 17th. The colossal 8,000-foot, 11-mile descent down to the seaside town of Tazacorte saw two of the previous top five runners fall back, while three held their position or moved up. Albon hit the ocean with the same 4.5-minute lead he had an hour and a half earlier high atop the island. Ah, but Evans made up 90 seconds to move into second along with teammate Mityaev over the descent. Dmitry Mityaev and Tom Evans running together in second late in the 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. At the same time, Small fell into fourth at 8.5 minutes off the lead. From there, there was a substantial gap back to the next runners with Manole, Stout,Pere Aurell(Spain), and Anguita all under 20 minutes off the lead. Baronian deployed his parachute on the descent and ended it in ninth, more than 30 minutes off the front. As the men made their way into the city center of Los Llanos de Aridane, Jon Albon held on to win in 7:03:10. Making up 2 minutes on Albon over the final 5k climb, teammates Dmitry Mityaev and Tom Evans finished hand in hand, tying in 7:05:16. Although he lost some time on the descent, Jeshurun Small ran strong over the final kilometers to take fourth in 7:10:54. Ionel Manole threw down a furious final sprint to beat out Ben Stout and hold onto fifth by 11 seconds, with the pair finishing in 7:19:21 and 7:19:32, respectively.

Ionel Manole (left) and Ben Stout (right) congratulate one another after a sprint finish for fifth at the 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Despite having a stacked field, the women’s race was dominated already in its early kilometers. By Deseadas (17k), Ruth Croft (New Zealand) had a 2.5-minute lead on Ida Nilsson (Sweden, lives in Norway), but Nilsson was, in turn, nearly 5 minutes in front of the rest of the women’s field. Here,Azara García(Spain) andEkaterina Mityaeva(Andorra) ran in third and fourth at 7 minutes off the lead withMarianne Hogan(Canada) andHannah Allgood(U.S.) less than a minute back.Keely Henninger(U.S.),Sunmaya Budha(Nepal),Emilie Collomb(Italy), andHillary Allen(U.S.) were the rest of the top 10 women at 9, 9.5, 10.5, and 13 minutes off the lead. Ruth Croft running in the lead late in the 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Croft continued to pull away from the field en route to El Reventón (31k), where she built a 4.5-minute lead on Nilsson. Budha held strong to move into third place at 12 minutes off the lead while the rest of the women’s field continued to fall off Croft’s furious pace. Hogan and García ran 13 and 14 minutes off the lead in fourth and fifth, respectively. While we don’t have a split for Mityaeva at El Reventón, she was sixth at the aid stations before and after that location. And then Nilsson dropped the hammer with a tremendous surge to catch Croft before El Roque de los Muchachos at 51k. At the same time, the lead duo continued to build time on the rest of the women’s field. Budha continued to run in third at the high point at 15 minutes off the front. At the same time, Allgood had run her way up into fourth roughly 24 minutes off the front with Hogan holding onto fifth at 28 minutes off the lead. Ida Nilsson (right) briefly leading Ruth Croft at the race’s high point. For perspective on just how well Croft and Nilsson were running up front through 51k, the sixth through ninth women at 50k were Mityaeva,Katharina Hartmuth(Germany), García, and Henninger, all of whom have world-class ultrarunning resumes and yet ran from 32 to 47 minutes off the leaders. Wow! Of Croft and Nilsson, it was Croft who had the downhill legs on the day. The Kiwi put 8 minutes on the Swede over the 8,000 feet and just over 90 minutes of descending to the ocean. Budha held her own on the descent, actually gaining a minute on Croft, but still sitting in third 14 minutes off the lead. At that point, the women’s podium seemed set with just 5k to go. Still, only 6 minutes separated the women in fourth through sixth. Mityaeva had made up ground on the descent to move into fourth at 34 minutes off the front. Allgood and Hogan raced in fifth and sixth, at 2 and 6 minutes behind Mityaeva. Ruth Croft continued her phenomenal run to the finish, coming across the line in a women’s course record time of 8:02:49, lowering Ida Nilsson’s time of 8:04:16 from 2017. Ida Nilsson rolled into the finish to take second in 8:16:32. Sunmaya Budha continued to close in on Nilsson, but ultimately finished in third in 8:20:31. Ekaterina Mityaeva held onto fourth in 8:40:59, while Hannah Allgood finished in fifth in 8:43:23. Sunmaya Budha running in third late in the 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Full results.

2024 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: Entrekin and Subertas Prevail in Dramatic Race Finishes,"With the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile frontrunners having crossed the finish line in Flagstaff, Arizona,Rachel EntrekinandHarry Subertasare winners of the women’s and men’s races. Both prevailed through truly dramatic and fascinating race stories. The race began at 5 a.m. local time on Monday, May 6, and concludes on Saturday, May 11. This edition marked the race’s fourth running. The point-to-point route begins in Black Canyon City and finishes in Flagstaff. The course changes from year to year, but this year’s course is said to be 249.4 miles long with roughly 40,000 feet of climbing and 35,000 feet of descending. On the course, runners experience the diversity of Arizona’s terrain and climate. In the low desert, runnable singletrack and doubletrack give runners terrain simplicity, but that’s complicated by heat and lack of shade from the sun. The course also visits a couple of mountain ranges, which provide shade and cool temperatures but can bring the challenges of altitude, significant elevation gain and loss, and more technical terrain. It looks like Rachel Entrekin stopped to smell the flowers on her way to winning the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile. Photo: Howie Stern A 250-mile-long race offers nearly infinite logistical challenges, with runners needing to stay on point with hydration and fueling, sleep and other forms of rest, gear management, foot care, and so much more. While the course has changed significantly in most previous years, the records for the current course areSarah Ostaszewskifor the women at 72 hours, 50 minutes, and 27 seconds, and 69:41:31 for the men byMichael McKnight, both run in 2023, the only time a substantially similar course was used. With all these variables, the Cocodona 250 Mile was sure to deliver surprises for all runners, including those at the front of the race. Rachel Entrekin, an ultrarunner since at least 2013, championed the women’s race. After running for most of the distance in second place, Entrekin took over the women’s race leadership late to secure the win. This followed longtime women’s race leaderMika Thewes’sudden — lengthy, but temporary — stop around mile 233. The men’s race came down to the wire betweenHarry SubertasandJeff Browning. Browning, a veteran of at least 150 ultras, led for most of the race. Subertas, winner of the 2022 Tahoe 200 Mile, started the race more conservatively. Subertas’ smart pacing allowed him to pass Browning to take over the lead with just a few miles to go — in a 250-mile race — to win and set a new course record. Runners continued to trickle over the finish line at the time of this article’s publishing, ahead of the 125-hour time limit. Read on for more of the race story. Phew, what a women’s race.Rachel Entrekintook over the race leadership late to win after longtime race leaderMika Thewessuddenly stopped during the third night of racing, around mile 233. Entrekin has won several 48-hour races, including most recently the 2023 Across the Years 48 Hour, where she finished with 212 miles. She’s also a 100-mile specialist, as UltraSignup shows she’s won at least eight 100 milers. But let’s back up to the race start. When the women settled into the early miles of racing on Monday morning, Mika Thewes, who has no less than twelve 200-plus-mile race finishes, including two Cocodona finishes, with a third place in 2023 and a fourth in 2021, ran as the race leader. Over the course of that first day, other top women’s runners, Entrekin,Aliza Lapierre, andLiz Canty, closely chased. During night 1, however, Entrekin passed Thewes to assume the women’s lead. As of mid-morning on Tuesday, around 26 hours into the race, Thewes trailed in second place by about two miles, and Lapierre was the third woman. Rachel Entrekin en route to the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile win. Photo: Howie Stern Around 32 hours into the race, on the afternoon of day 2, Thewes retook the women’s lead, which she would hold for over 100 miles. The pass happened at the Jerome aid station, mile 126 — the race’s halfway point mileage-wise — when Entrekin arrived first, and Thewes arrived second, but Thewes left first while Entrekin stayed in the aid station for a couple of hours, likely to take a nap. At this midway point mileage-wise, Lapierre maintained third position, despite sharing with the race organization that she was having a rough race thus far. The Brazilian living in Spain,Manu Vilasecaran a couple of miles behind Lapierre in fourth place, looking like she had the potential to move up in the rankings. As night 2 arrived, Thewes opened her lead on the women’s field to seven miles, while Entrekin and Lapierre continued to occupy positions two and three. By daybreak on Wednesday morning, the race’s 48-hour mark, Thewes passed mile 175 and had increased her lead to about 9.5 miles. Entrekin ran in second, while, overnight, Vilaseca assumed the women’s third-place position and was now running right behind Entrekin. During the day on Wednesday, Thewes increased her lead by a lot. When the race hit 60 hours elapsed on Wednesday evening, Thewes was just under 220 miles into the race with a nearly 20-mile lead. Behind Thewes, Vilaseca and Entrekin were locked in a close duel all day Wednesday, vying for second and third places. Coming up on Wednesday night and 60 hours elapsed, Vilaseca put some distance between her and Entrekin, running 2.5 miles ahead of her. Manu Vilaseca took second at the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile. Photo: Howie Stern But this trio still had a fair bit of real estate to cover, and anything can — and did — happen. Overnight on night 3, the landscape of the women’s race totally changed. Entrekin passed Vilaseca to take over second place once again. Then, around mile 233, Thewes suddenly stopped, and it was thought that she’d dropped from the race. Entrekin assumed the women’s race lead, which put Vilaseca in second place.Kylee Drugan-Eppichmoved up into third position. In the soft light after dawn on Thursday morning, Rachel Entrekin smoothly ran into downtown Flagstaff, to win the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile in 73:31:25. At the finish, she took a seat, shook her head, and said, “So easy.” Manu Vilaseca took second in 78:04:35. Vilaseca has a big ultra resume dating back to before 2011. Her top races in recent years have included a win at the 2022 Bryce Canyon 100 Mile and 5th place at the 2019 TDS. It looks like this is her first finish of a 200-plus-mile race. Against all odds, at around the 77-hour mark, mid-morning on Thursday, the race organization shared on the event livestream that Thewes had stopped in the night due to an injury from a fall, sought medical attention, and was cleared by both medical and the race organization to restart the race where she’d stopped. So, roughly 12 hours after stopping, she rejoined the race, assuming third place, with Drugan-Eppich moving back to fourth position. Mika Thewes finished third, for a second year in a row, in 79:30:12, with some super-fast final miles. Kylee Drugan-Eppich was the fourth woman in80:04:55, looking fresh and strong during her run to the finish line through the streets of Flagstaff. This looks to be Drugan-Eppich’s first 200-plus-mile race, and it also looks like she has just one 100-mile finish to her name, a win of the 2022 Zion 100 Mile. Carrie Hendersonwas the fifth woman to finish in 83:37:40. This looks to be Henderson’s second Cocodona finish; she was sixth place in 2022. Full results. Talk about a closing effort:Harry Subertaswon the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile men’s race by taking over the lead in the race’s final miles to set a new course record. Here are the dynamics of how this played out. From the starting line on Monday in Black Canyon City,Joe McConaughytook the men’s race out, leading for much of the first day and night. McConaughy was the 2022 Cocodona champion, and he holds the current men’s supported fastest known time on the 817-mile Arizona Trail. Trailing McConaughy throughout the first day of running were top menJeff Browning,Arlen Glick,Michael Versteeg,Jeff Garmire,Michael McKnight, and others. Overnight Monday night, on the first night of the race, Browning overtook first-day leader McConaughy to assume the lead of the men’s race. And as night turned to sunrise on Tuesday, and the race clock ticked past 24 hours, Browning had built an approximately five-mile lead. Browning maintained the same approximate gap on second place during day 2, passing the 150-mile mark with roughly a four-mile lead. Around midafternoon on day 2, some 33 hours in, McConaughy ran as second man, and Glick in third place, only a few miles apart from each other. However, very close to Glick were Versteeg andHarry Subertas, the latter looking super fresh and like he could move up after a more conservative first day and a half of racing. Harry Subertas won the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile via a come-from-behind performance where he only took over the race lead with a few miles left in the race. Photo: Howie Stern When the sun set on day 2, Browning’s gap on second place McConaughy was roughly three miles. By now Subertas had moved up to third position. At sunrise on Wednesday, as the race clock ticked past 48 hours, Browning passed the race’s 200-mile mark. Overnight, he maintained his lead by about four miles. Subertas, meanwhile, continued to move up, assuming second place, with McConaughy now in third at around nine miles back of second. Glick was now in fourth, just behind McConaughy. During the third day of racing, on Wednesday, Browning’s lead shrunk rapidly as Subertas in second inched closer. At the final aid station, at mile 242, Subertas was only about 17 minutes in arrears. Then, less than an hour later, when the duo came off the final descent for the final three-mile run from the outskirts of Flagstaff to its downtown finish, Subertas led by roughly five minutes, running at a solid clip, while Browning looked to be walking it in. Jeff Browning is all smiles after finishing second at the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile. Photo: Howie Stern Harry Subertas arrived to the finish line in Flagstaff, Arizona, the men’s 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile champion, setting a new course record in 59 hours, 50 minutes, and 55 seconds. Jeff Browning took a super solid second, finishing in 60:19:57, just under 30 minutes behind the winner. Glick made fast work of day 3, moving solidly into third position. At mile 235, he was four miles behind second place, and seven miles ahead of fourth place. Steady forward movement would ensure him the final men’s podium spot, and that’s exactly what he did. When all was said and done, Arlen Glick took third, in his first 200-plus-mile race, in61:46:57. In the evening hours of night 3, Joe McConaughy, the 2022 Cocodona champion, finished in fourth place in 64:03:02. Inaugural 2021 Cocodona champion, Michael Versteeg, took fifth in 65:45:20.

"2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k Results: Farvard Has Breakout Win, Schide Storms","At the 2024Canyons by UTMB 100k,Rod Farvardhad a breakout performance to win the men’s race andKatie Schide(U.S., lives in France) ran an absolute stormer to win for the women. While this year marked the event’s 10th edition, if there’s anything we’ve grown to understand, change is constant at this race. With significant course changes in many editions, this year was no different. Starting at China Wall, a trailhead located in the mid-foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the race traveled roughly east to west — with some deviations — to finish in downtown Auburn, California. Runners traveled an overall downhill trending course, still with over 12,000 feet of climbing over the course of 63 miles. A chunk of the middle of the course traversed the famous Western States Trail, and included some of its iconic parts, such as the Devil’s Thumb climb, a stiff climb that finishes passing a thumb-looking rock; the Deadwood Cemetary, a historic cemetery; and Cal Street, an almost-20-mile, mostly downhill, and mostly a gloriously runnable piece of real estate. The men’s leaders in the early going of the 2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k. Photo: UTMB/Howie Stern The race started at 5 a.m. local time on Saturday, April 27, under clear skies, with mild temperatures and relatively dry air predicted all day. This was perhaps a welcome reprieve for runners, as the region had seen significant rainfall in the prior days. This race held lots of competitive appeal in that it was the last Western States 100 Golden Ticket race ahead of the 2024 event, where the two women and men would earn entry into the race. The event was also a UTMB World Series Major, meaning the top 10 men and women secured entry into the CCC at the UTMB World Series Finals, which will be held this August in Chamonix, France. The men’s race went out en masse, with around 20 men within 2 minutes of each other at the first aid station at Deadwood 1 (16k). Leading this loose pack werePetter Engdahl(Sweden, lives in Norway),Rod Farvard, andAdam Peterman. By Deadwood 2 (29k), the second aid station, Engdahl and Farvard still led together, again with a long line of men trailing tightly, at least 10 of them within 2 minutes, including Peterman. Engdahl and Peterman were running on strong comeback stories, with Engdahl having suffered broken bones with surgery last fall in a bike crash, and Peterman returning after at least a year off due to serious injury. Each would avenge these career complications with finishes today, Engdahl on the podium and Peterman in 13th. And Farvard, like so many men, was hunting one of those Western States 100 Golden Tickets; with 3 prior attempts at that race, he’d only topped out as high as 11th place, clearly less than his potential. Among the early near leaders through the first 30k also includedStephen Kersh,Tracen Knopp,Preston Cates, andDrew Holmen. Michigan Bluff (38k) saw some more of the same, with Engdahl and Kersh leading the train and most of the same men following very closely. Though there were some 6 men right there, Farvard technically beeped into the checkpoint in third place. The village of Foresthill, 48k into the race, marked something of a transition point in the race where the runners head out of the race’s higher country, and down to the lowest terrain of the Sierra Nevada. The competition was also transitional in Foresthill as it was here where eventual men’s champ Farvard arrived in the lead in 4:13:43, with Kersh about 20 seconds back. Another 2 minutes brought men’s second and third place, Holmen and Engdahl. From there on, Farvard would not yield the lead. At 61k, the Cal 2 aid station, he passed at 5:16:19 elapsed. This time Kersh checked in a little over a minute back. Here, Holmen was holding in third, 2 minutes off second, andMakai Clemonshad now moved into fourth position, another 2 minutes back from third place. But it was still any man’s race, with a spread of less than 13 minutes between first and ninth places. At Driver’s Flat (76k), Farvard held tight to his small but solid lead, passing through in 6:33:33. This time, Holmen had moved into second place, 3 minutes behind the lead. Kersh was right there, though, 30 seconds off Holmen. For the race’s final quarter, Farvard added bits of distance between he and second place, passing through the final two aid stations, Mammoth Bar (88k) and Confluence (94k), with respective 5- and 7-minute leads. Rod Farvard looked totally elated to cross the finish line, winning the men’s race in 8:44:30. He gladly accepted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Rod Farvard winning the 2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k. Photo: UTMB/Howie Stern Behind him, Holmen ran a super steady last 25k, and built a meaningful enough gap on the rest of the field, passing through the 88k and 94k aid stations some 6 and 4 minutes ahead of third place, respectively. When Drew Holmen crossed the line to take second in 8:51:09, he tossed his pack and collapsed to the ground, clearly using most of what he had in him for that performance. After some finish-line contemplation, Holmen declined the Golden Ticket, which meant it would roll down to third place. But who would be the third-place finisher? As we know, ultimately, Engdahl. After sitting in fifth place as late as 88k, he surged to move up two spots when he passed the 94k aid station. Petter Engdahl’s excellent ultra pacing led him to take third in 8:55:31. He was eager to claim the second men’s Western States Golden Ticket. Having run a hugely consistent race, Makai Clemens finished fourth in 8:57:38. Stephen Kersh, after pushing the men’s race pace earlier, found himself in fifth at 9:05:56. Full results. The 2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k men’s podium (left to right): 2. Drew Holmen, 1. Rod Farvard, 3. Petter Engdahl. Photo: UTMB/Jacob Banta The start of the women’s race couldn’t have played out more differently from the men’s.Katie Schide(U.S., lives in France) took the women’s race out, created a gap early, and ran on. By the first aid station at Deadwood 1 (16k), Schide had already built a gap on the field, some 2.5 minutes. She grew that gap by the second aid point at Deadwood 2 (29k) to nearly 9.5 minutes. Schide, with too many accolades to mention, wassecond at last year’s Western States 100and has her eyes on the prize of that race this year. Undoubtedly, this race was a critical step in her preparations for this year’s edition. EmKay Sullivanwas a women’s pace pusher over the first 30k, running around Schide early on, assuming the second position after that, and never looking back. Sullivan has loads of strong trail race performances to her name, with all of them at shorter distances than this one. Mary Denholmfeatured prominently in podium position over the first 30k, having passed through the 16k and 29k aid stations in podium position. Denholm is a 2-time Olympic Marathon Trials qualifier with a 2:36:28 marathon PR, who was basically debuting in trail racing. Also among the mix for the women over the first 30k wereAddie Bracyas well as AustraliansAnna McKennaandStephanie Auston. By Michigan Bluff (39k), Schide led by about 11 minutes. Sullivan remained Schide’s closest chaser, with Denholm in third place, just under 13 minutes off the lead. Ten kilometers later, at Foresthill (49k), the Schide Show was officially in full force, with her arriving at 4:25:14 and with more than 21 minutes of real estate to the next woman. Sullivan and Denholm maintained their second- and third-place positions, around 2 minutes apart from each other. Behind Denholm was also some decent daylight, with fourth-place Bracy coming through about 10.5 minutes after third place. Schide was truly ablaze at Cal 2, the 61k, some two-thirds of the way down Cal Street, running through in 5:31:21. There, she’d also cracked the overall top 10. Due to a lack of women’s coverage in the live stream as well as issues with Sullivan’s tracking devices, we don’t have her split at Cal 2, but she was in second place here. Denholm was the next woman through in third, 65 minutes off the lead. At Driver’s Flat (76k), Schide was now picking her way through the men’s top 10, passing in sixth overall in 6:50:38. For the record, that’s 17 minutes back from the men’s leader three-quarters of the way through a trail 100k — some insane running. Schide’s lead in the women’s race would only grow over the race’s final quarter, and she remained in sixth place overall at the finish line. At Mammoth Bar (88k) and Confluence (94k), she led by 44 and 46 minutes respectively. Ultimately, Katie Schide was the runaway women’s victor in 9:10:10. It’s safe to say that things are looking really good for Schide’s second attempt at the Western States 100 this summer. With her automatic entry based on her top-10 finish last year, the two Western States 100 Golden Tickets would roll down to other women. Katie Schide winning the 2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k. Photo: UTMB/Howie Stern Sullivan’s race for second place never wavered. At 88k and 94k, she held a respective 7- and 9-minute gap over third place. EmKay Sullivan cruised over the finish line to take second in 10:01:26. While she cautiously accepted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket at the finish line, she later decided to not officially accept it, which meant it would roll down to another woman. Behind Schide and Sullivan, the race for the women’s top 10 was anything but set in the race’s final 25k. Denholm, the debut trail racer, ran into problems en route to Driver’s Flat (76k), relinquishing her podium position. At the time of this article’s publishing, she’s not showing an official DNF, but she certainly has. As the women’s positions fluctuated, it would beAnna Louden (née Kascius)who emerged into the third position by 88k and who would hold it until she finished in 10:24:37. Kacius has about 3 years of ultrarunning under her belt, with top finishes including seventh at the 2022 IAU 100k World Championships, and fourth at the 2023 Black Canyon 100k. She narrowly missed a Golden Ticket by one position at that latter event. This time, she was golden, graciously accepting that Western States 100 entry. Careth Arnoldfinished fourth in 10:38:42, after moving up into that spot before the 94k aid station. When the second Western States 100 Golden Ticket rolled down to her post-race, she accepted it. Anna McKenna rounded out the women’s top 5, crossing the line in 10:43:31. EmKay Sullivan taking second at the 2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k. Photo: UTMB/Howie Stern Full results.

2024 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: New Winners with Valmassoi and Dhiman,"Leaving the seaside village of Porto Moniz at midnight on Saturday, April 27, runners in the 2024Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) set off from northwest Madeira on their 115-kilometer (72 miles) run across the small Portuguese island in the Atlantic Ocean. When all was said and done,Martina Valmassoi(Italy) andBen Dhiman(U.S., lives in France) took home the women’s and men’s victories. But there was a lot of landscape and racing in between. With 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of climbing, the route is technical, steep, and demanding. Starting at sea level and finishing on the far eastern end of the island at Machico, back at sea level again, runners travel over countless mountains, including the route’s high point, Pico Ruivo at 1,800 meters (5,900 feet). Thousands of stairs are also infamous on this race course, which adds a unique element to the racing experience. The route treats runners to stunning views of big mountains, the ocean, and everything in between. The 2024 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 115k getting underway. Photo: MIUT/João M Faria While last year’s race was less competitive than other editions, this year promised to serve up fast racing on the women’s side with a list of starters includingAnne-Lise Rousset Séguret(France),Martina Valmassoi(Italy),Claire Bannwarth(France), andMaite Maiora(Spain), who all had the potential to mix it up at the front of the race. On the men’s side, the likes ofMiguel Arsénio(Portugal),Ben Dhiman(U.S., lives in France),Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon(France), andSebastian Krogvig(Norway) promised a show. Last year’s French sweep of the event was not to be repeated with new faces dominating the podium this edition. On the men’s side, Dhiman, who placed third at the 2023 Les Templiers, ran near the front of the race for its entirety and pulled away from the rest of the field after the high point, 75 kilometers into the race, to reach the finish line first. The top 2 of the women’s race stayed tight, and the gap between Valmassoi and Rousset did not open up until well into the second half. Valmassoi, the 2022 TDS winner, ultimately broke the tape at Machico first in a time of 16:14:10. Read on for the in-depth race story. While on paper, a number of names were vying for the top spot in the women’s race, it ended as a duel between Italy’sMartina Valmassoiand France’sAnne-Lise Rousset Séguret. After running within minutes of each other for the majority of the race and opening up a seemingly insurmountable gap on the rest of the field, it was Valmassoi who reached the oceanside at Machico first in a time of 16:14:10. Rousset was second with a time of 16:28:27, andMaite Maioraof Spain rounded out the podium with a time of 17:12:22. Rousset was the first to make her intentions for the race known as she went straight to the front and created a nearly 2-minute gap on the rest of the field just 22 kilometers into the race. Valmassoi along withFiona Porte(France),Sandra Sevillano(Spain), Maiora, andAroa Sío(Spain) followed to make up the top 5 in the early hours of racing. As the racers traversed the rugged mountains of Madeira, it became clear that it was shaping up to be a 2-woman race between Rousset and Valmassoi. Just 30k in, they’d stretched the gap to third-place Maiora to more than 15 minutes. Anne-Lise Rousset Seguret covering kilometers at night in the rain. Photo: MIUT/João M Faria By the time the women reached the course high point at Pico Ruivo, nearly 75k into the race, the gap between the top 2, Valmassoi and Rousset, who were still close to each other, and third-place Maiora was up to 30 minutes.Claire Bannwarthof France was another 30 minutes back in fourth, with Sío in fifth just 30 seconds behind her. From Pico Ruivo, at an elevation of 1,800 meters, it’s a long 40k downhill run to the ocean, with plenty of climbs included to keep things interesting. As the women headed toward the ocean, Valmassoi increased the 3-minute lead she held on Rousset as the 2 had crossed over the course high point. By Chão da Lagoa at the 84k mark, the gap was up to about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, Maiora kept pace with the lead duo and maintained the 30-minute gap up to second. Behind her, Bannwarth and Sío continued to run near each other an additional 35 minutes in arrears. Valmassoi was first to Machico, holding on to a 14-minute gap over second-place Rousset. Maiora rounded out the podium in a time of 17:12:22. Claire Bannwarth and Aroa Sio finished fourth and fifth respectively, with times of 17:50:24 and 18:14:53.

While there was plenty of strong racing at the front end of the race in the early hours of the event, it was ultimatelyBen Dhiman, from the U.S. but who lives in France, who reached the ocean at Machico first in a time of 13:52:46. He was followed by Norway’sSebastian Krogvigand France’sMartin Kernwho finished in 14:12:54 and 14:15:23, respectively. Fourth placeAnthony Costaof France was just 17 seconds behind. The top four men established themselves at the front at Pico de Ruivo, the high point of the race at about 75k, and never looked back. Early on in the event, all of the expected top names featured at the pointy end of the race, includingMiguel Arsénio(Portugal),Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon(France),Luís Fernandes(Portugal), Dhiman,Jeff Mogavero(U.S.), Krogvig, and Kern. This lead group was within minutes of each other for the first 20k of rugged Madeira mountains. Dhiman and Arsenio seemed to be on a mission to push the pace early on in the race and ran in close proximity to each other until Estanquinhos, 33k into the race. From there, it seemed like the racing was properly on, with the two of them changing leads over the next 30k. Sebastian Krogvig getting it done on the way to placing second. Photo: MIUT/João M Faria Their pace opened up a large gap on the rest of the field. After 48k of racing, the trio of Krogvig, Kern, and Mogavero were close together coming into the Encumeada checkpoint, with the time gap between them under a minute as they battled for third place on the ground. Their gap to the front 2 leaders was nearly 10 minutes just under halfway into the race.Brian Culmo(U.S.),Francesco Cucco(Italy), and Costa followed the top 5, another 20 minutes back. As the kilometers ticked by and runners reached the course high point 75 kilometers into the race, Dhiman established a clear lead on the field as Arsénio faded back and eventually dropped from the event. Krogvig, Kern, and Costa made up the rest of the top 5 at the checkpoint, with second through fourth all within 20 minutes of one another. With Arsénio dropping out, there were now 2 podium places to fight for on the back half of the course. With all the big climbs over, runners simply had to make it back to the ocean. But it was far from all downhill with several significant inclines to negotiate in the final 40k. Still, very little changed at the front of the race from the high point to the finish, with Dhiman continuing to run steady at the front of the field and Krogvig, Kern, Costa, and Mogavero behind, making up the top 5. Portuguese runnersNelson Santosand Fernandez did their best to maintain contact with the lead. In the final kilometers of the race, first place seemed secured, but the battle between second and fourth stayed tight. Krogvig was able to hold on to second and Kern just edged out Costa by just 17 seconds to capture the final podium place. Santos was able to close the gap to Mogavero to round out the top 5. Update:Sebastian Krogvig(Norway) was originally reported to have finished second in 14:12, but he received an hour time penalty due to following an incorrect route near Chão da Lagoa at the 84k mark, and, now, he sits in seventh place in 15:12. That moves Kern into third, Costa into fourth, and Mogavero into fifth in 15:01:01. Ben Dhiman on his way to the win at the 2024 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 115k.

2024 Marathon des Sables Legendary Results: Rachid El Morabity and Aziza El Amrany Victorious,"After a week of racing, the 2024Marathon des Sables Legendarystage race has concluded in Morocco’s Sahara Desert.Rachid El MorabityandAziza El Amranytook home victory for the host country in the men’s and women’s races. For El Morabity, it was his 10th win of the event, and for El Amrany, her first. The seven-day, self-sufficiency stage race is often identified as one of the hardest footraces in the world. Throughout the race, runners navigate dunes, climb jebels (mountains), and run across a multitude of surfaces in an attempt to make it to the finish line. Runners carry a backpack of self-sufficiency, containing the food and camping gear needed for the week; the race organization provides only a shade tent and water. Each of the race’s six stages offers a unique challenge and no one is guaranteed to make it to the end, not even those in the elite field. The race bivouac before the 2024 Marathon des Sables Legendary. Photo: MDS/Ian Corless The 2024 race started on Sunday, April 14, and concluded on Saturday, April 20. This year’s 252.8-kilometer (157 miles) course was divided into the following six stages: This year was set to be a fast one. The temperature at the start of the race was a moderate 18 degrees Celsius (65 Fahrenheit), making it cool compared to previous years and easier for athletes to make a quick getaway on the fairly easy first day. However, as the week went on, temperatures rose to the extreme, along with wind and sandstorms, too. In the men’s race, eyes were turned to the Moroccan El Morabity brothers — older brother Rachid and younger brotherMohamed El Morabity— who were favorites leading up to the event. Morocco’sAziza Rajiwas the favorite in the women’s field, having won the race in 2021. But Morocco’s Aziza El Amrany, with two previous podium finishes over the last two years, was sure to challenge. The early going of Stage 1 in the 2024 Marathon des Sables Legendary. Photo: MDS/Ian Corless The competition was set during a big year of change for the longtime race, with this year being the event’s 38th edition. Iconic race founderPatrick Bauerpassed the reigns toCyril Gauthier, operator of the Half Marathon des Sables events. Through this, the week-long stage race took an evolved name, the Marathon des Sables Legendary. Additionally, logistical shake-ups abound for runners on the ground, namely the shift of the notorious long stage to Stage 3 rather than Stage 4. Also, the final Stage 6 has been for some years a non-competitive charity stage, but this year it was timed and a part of the overall competition. Read on for how the race played out. Ahead of the race, all eyes were turned to nine-time Marathon des Sables winnerRachid El Morabityof Morocco, as well as his brotherMohamed El Morabity(Morocco), a six-time finisher with one win and five second places to his name. Rachid made a strong start to Stage 1, dashing off at an average pace of 18 kilometers per hour, testing the rest of the competition to see if they would keep up. By halfway through the first stage, Rachid slowed when his brotherMohamed El Morabity(Morocco) andAziz Yachou(Morocco) were the only athletes close behind. At the end of Stage 1, it was the younger brother Mohamed in the lead, winning the stage in 2:11:09, followed by Rachid (2:11:36) and Aziz (2:11:38). In fourth, it was fellow Moroccan and older brother of Aziz,Hamid Yachou, withAhmed Ouikhalfenalso of Morocco in fifth. Mohamed El Morabity winning Stage 1 of the 2024 Marathon des Sables Legendary.

The three race leaders running together in Stage 2. Photo: MDS/Antonio Miranda Now for the big one: Stage 3. This was the longest stage, with 85.3 kilometers (53 miles). It takes place over two days with a 35-hour cut-off time. Usually, during the long stage, we see the leaders create a gap with their competitors, just as Mohamed did this year. He started competitively and got better as the day unfolded. After 25 kilometers, Mohamed accelerated ahead of his competition through the stage’s technical sections. By the end of the stage, Mohamed had a lead of over 10 kilometers, finishing in 7:37:47. But the Stage 3 race wasn’t over. Behind Mohamed, his brother Rachid battled it out with Aziz. Right until the last moment, the pair were head to head. With 200 meters to go Rachid launched a sprint, but Aziz’s speed couldn’t be matched. Aziz crossed the line at 8:31:52, just one second before Rachid. There was also a surprise entrance fromYoann Stuckof France, who finished just seven minutes behind Rachid and Aziz, overtaking Hamid for fourth in the stage.

Photo: MDS/Ian Corless In an attempt to reclaim overall fourth place, Hamid raced ahead during the start of Stage 4 but was caught by the El Morabity brothers after the first sandy section. Despite his efforts, he was eventually overtaken by Stuck, who hung onto fourth place for the stage, beating Hamid by a mere second. Further ahead, Rachid broke away from his brother Mohamed and Aziz by the 30-kilometer mark, winning the stage and solidifying his overall second-place position ahead of Aziz in the overall standings. Mohamed and Aziz would finish together 95 seconds behind Rachid. There was a dramatic turn of events during Stage 5. Mohamed started the stage with a 53-minute overall lead but started slowing by 10 kilometers into the 31-kilometer stage, slowed greatly by 20 kilometers, and stepped out of the third checkpoint with a bandage around his thigh. He limped over the finish line in 35th position. This opened up the field for Rachid and Aziz, who now both had a chance to claim first place. Rachid accelerated to the finish line, 40 seconds ahead of Aziz and, just as importantly, more than 52 minutes ahead of Mohamed. The top three remained unchanged at the end of the day, but the overall competition was very tight among them heading into the race’s final stage, with Mohamed 35 seconds ahead of Rachid and 2 minutes and 51 seconds ahead of Aziz. Rachid El Morabity on his way to winning Stage 5. Photo: MDS/Ian Corless The battle for first place continued into the sixth and final stage, with the top three runners remaining fairly tight throughout the 21-kilometer stage. In the end, Rachid and Aziz went head to head. With another sprint finish, Rachid El Morabity took a two-second lead and won the stage with a time of 1:22:05 and an overall winning time of 20:42:19, for his 10th overall victory at the race. Rachid now stands with only one other runner to have won the race 10 times, Morocco’sLahcen Ahansal. Right behind was Aziz Yachou who crossed the line in 1:22:07 and finished third overall with a time of 20:44:37. This was Aziz’s fourth finish, and he’s never finished slower than fourth place. Mohamed El Morabity retained third in this stage, crossing the line a minute later than his brother in 1:23:05 and taking second overall in 20:42:44 — his sixth time finishing second and his seventh finish of the event.

Morocco’sAziza El Amranyled with an average pace of 14 kilometers per hour, far ahead of the competition. Although she slowed down during the second half of Stage 1, El Amrany still finished way ahead in a time of 2:45:54 and 17th overall. One of the favorites for this year’s competition,Aziza Raji(Morocco) was the 2021 winner and has placed in the top 10 in all five Marathon des Sables that she’s completed. Raji came in 26 minutes behind El Amrany and took second place for Stage 1. She was closely followed byAdriana Moserof The Netherlands in third place, a first-timer who won the most recent Half Marathon des Sables. Multi-time podium finisherGemma Game(U.K.) and three-time winnerLaurence Klein(France) followed in fourth and fifth. Aziza El Amrany winning Stage 1 of the 2024 Marathon des Sables Legendary. Photo: MDS/Antonio Miranda Stage 2 took a surprising start as Klein tried to lead but was quickly caught by El Amrany, who went on to win the second stage. At the end of day two, the overall podium remained the same with El Amrany holding a 46-minute total lead. Things remained stable on the podium for the third stage of the women’s race. There was speculation as to whether El Amrany would be able to hold her position on this, the longest stage, after two strong days. However, there was no doubt in the end, as she once again dominated most of the stage, besting Raji by 38 minutes and Moser by 78 minutes. Leading Frenchwoman Klein suffered a blow around 30 kilometers. Fortunately, her son, who was also competing, caught up with Klein and they completed the last 25 kilometers of the stage together. It was another win for Aziza El Amrany in Stage 3. Photo: MDS/Ian Corless During Stage 4, things started to heat up, literally. With the rising temperatures, El Amrany suffered heat exhaustion, which slowed her down but didn’t stop her. She still went on to finish in first place in 4:29:41, 23 minutes ahead of Raji. The biggest news of this stage came from Moser, who made an early exit just 5 kilometers into the stage. The long third stage caused severe blisters on her feet, which led to a change in stride and, eventually, leg pain. This devastating blow for Moser shifted the U.K.’s Game up to third position overall, whileRajaa Hamdaouaof France finished third in this stage and moved into fourth overall. Australia’sLois Pickeringmoved up to fifth place in the overall rankings for the first time. Finally, it was time for Raji to shine in Stage 5. After yesterday’s heat illness and with a comfortable lead, El Amrany understandably held back in Stage 5. This left the field open for Raji to take the stage win for the first time in the race, besting El Amrany by eight seconds. Game also eased up to fifth place in the stage, but held onto third place in the overall rankings. Aziza Raji finishing Stage 3. Photo: MDS/Antonio Miranda The race for first place was much less competitive on the final day of the women’s race as El Amrany won the sixth and final stage, taking first place in five out of the six stages and creating a good distance between her and the rest of the field. Aziza El Amrany completed the final stage in 1:41:21 and won the overall race by more than two hours with a time of 27:06:27. Aziza Raji came second in this stage in 1:55:54 and overall with a time of 29:09:04. Gemma Game was further out in the field for the sixth stage but still managed to retain her overall third place, with a finishing time of 32:18:58. This is her fourth finish of the event and her third time finishing in third place — a woman of consistency.

"2024 Barkley Marathons Results: Jasmin Paris First Ever Women’s Finisher, Most Finishers Ever","The 2024Barkley Marathonshas concluded outside of Wartburg, Tennessee, with a record-breaking five runners finishing this year’s edition and women’s history made asJasmin Paris(U.K.) became the first woman to ever finish the event in a time of 59 hours, 58 minutes, and 21 seconds. In the men’s race,Ihor Verys(Ukraine, lives in Canada) finished first,John Kelly(U.S.) second,Jared Campbell(U.S.) third, andGreig Hamilton(New Zealand) fourth. You can also enjoy our in-depth post-Barkleyinterview with Jasmin Parisas well as ourinterview with Ihor Verys. Jasmin Paris becomes the first woman finisher of the Barkley Marathons at the event’s 2024 edition, with 99 seconds to spare. Photo: Howie Stern But let’s rewind 60 hours, to the start of the 2024 edition. Runners and their crews camped in Frozen Head State Park heard the sound of the conch at 4:17 a.m. on Wednesday, March 20, signaling that they had one hour to prepare for the start of lap one of the Barkley Marathons. This was after a car alarm earlier in the night sent people scrambling for their race kit, thinking it was the sound of the conch. As is tradition, no start list was published, and details from the event were scarce. Followers were glued to theTwitter feed of ultrarunner and official Barkley reporterKeith Dunn, who provided amazing and hilarious commentary throughout the 60-hour event, which officially started at 5:17 a.m. Also, a hat tip toTakawho has for several years maintainedan unofficial but excellent spreadsheet to track runners’ progress. With a good weather forecast, runners were probably as optimistic as is realistically possible about completing the incredibly brutal course, which changes and gets harder every year there are finishers. With a record three finishers last year, one can only assume that race directorGary Cantrell, aka Lazarus Lake,took the routing of the 26-ish mile loop up a notch. To finish the race, runners must complete five laps of the course within 60 hours, alternating directions for the first four, and then any remaining runners setting off in opposite directions on the fifth and final lap, after the first runner out on the fifth lap chooses their preferred direction. The mostly off-trail race tends to cover on the order of 130 miles with 63,000 feet of elevation gain, though no one besides the race director knows for sure as GPS watches and spectators aren’t allowed on the course. Runners collect pages from books hidden along the course to prove they cover each loop. From the start, attention was on Paris to see if she could become the first woman to complete all five laps of the Barkley Marathons this year. She set out for her record-setting fifth and final lap with 13 hours remaining, and with five minutes until the end, all eyes were down the road. With two Fun Runs already to her name in 2022 and 2023, she completed the first three laps of this year’s race in a new women’s record time and became only the second woman in the event’s history to set out on lap four. Fun Runs consist of completing three laps of the course in 40 hours, and finishing this is considered a proper achievement in itself. Then she became the first woman ever to complete the fourth lap and set out for her fifth. And ultimately, she returned to the yellow gate at the race’s start-finish line triumphant, as the fifth and final finisher for 2024. Meanwhile, on the men’s side, a mix of prior Barkley finishers, near finishers, and hopefuls got a record-breaking six men out on the final lap. After leading for much of the race’s second half, and getting the choice of direction for the final lap, Verys was the first one back to the yellow gate in a time of 58:44:59, an amazing run for a Barkley first-timer. Kelly came in next with a time of 59:15:38, his third finish of the event, and Campbell finished for an incredible fourth time in 59:30:32. The fourth finisher, Hamilton, reached the finish in 59:38:42. Whether it was good weather, an ever-increasing amount of course knowledge, or an incredibly strong field, the 2024 edition’s runners set a variety of additional records. This included a record for the number of finishers of the event in a single year, up from last year’s three, and brought the total number of people to complete the course to 20. This also includes a record 12 Barkley participants who finished Fun Runs this year, up from 10 in 2023. Read more about how the women’s and men’s races played out below. It was a historic moment at 5:16 p.m. on Friday, March 22, under two minutes before the race’s 60-hour cutoff, at Frozen Head State Park whenJasmin Paris(U.K.) became the first woman to complete the Barkley Marathons in a time of 59:58:21. And while during the initial hours of the event, it seemed like she was well on pace to complete the event, it came down those final 99 seconds. Early reports from the ground were spotty. With the entrants list of Barkley kept secret, and only some runners having outed themselves as heading to Tennessee for the event, details of how the early laps of the race played out were kept under wraps. It wasn’t until she completed the second lap of the course that Keith Dunn confirmed Paris as a participant. With Paris’ return to the Barkley for her third attempt this year, many believed this could be the chance for a woman to finish all five laps of the course. Paris finished the three-lap Fun Run in her initial attempt at the race in 2022. At the time, she was best known for winning the 268-mile Winter Spine Race outright in 2019 with a time of 83:12:23, a record that stood until 2024.

Photo: Howie Stern Paris returned to Barkley in 2023, finished another Fun Run, and became only the second woman to start lap four. The first wasSue Johnstonin 2001. In this effort, she ran out of time on the fourth lap. Details on how many other women joined Paris on the Barkley start line are still unavailable. We understand at least two other women made up the women’s race, includingKelly Halpin(U.S.), who tapped out midway through loop two, andLisa McFadden(U.S.). We’ll update this section if we learn about any other women in this year’s edition. Paris went out strong with the top men and was part of the group of four that were the first to head out on loop three. Clearly on a mission, she finished her third loop in 32:15:53, a new Fun Run women’s record, and she also became the first woman to finish three laps three times. The previous women’s Fun Run record was set by Johnston in 2001 at 32:57:00. Paris headed out for loop four at 32:27:50, and, according to Dunn, was “smiling and looking good.” After 46:29:12, a little over 14 hours, Paris returned to the start-finish line, completing loop four and becoming the first woman to do so in the race’s 37-year history. After an approximately 25-minute break, Paris headed back on course, in the clockwise direction. She had about 13 hours to complete the final loop, after completing loop four in about 14 hours. On Paris’ side, it was mostly daylight for the fifth lap, along with the reportedly easier-to-navigate clockwise course direction. Ultrarunning fans had a nail-biting 13-hour wait! Jasmin Paris made everyone wait right up until there was just over a minute and a half left on the race clock. She touched the yellow gate at 59:58:21. She also now holds the honor of having the slowest known time on the course, a goal to which Barkley finishers aspire. To learn more about Jasmin Paris, readour in-depth profile about her from 2020, written byDamian Hall(U.K.), a two-time Barkley attempter himself, including this year. The early day or so of the men’s race was just as mysterious as the women’s, with the identity of participants not being officially confirmed until they completed two laps. In the meantime, Keith Dunn provided insightful commentary into the situation with tweets including, “A tall skinny guy in a red hat is past the fire tower. #BM100” and “A guy with a gray beard and a muscular guy with tree trunk legs came through the fire tower at 12:55. #BM100.” As the hours wore on, it became clear that a deep field of men was contesting this year’s Barkley, including last year’s winnerAurélien Sanchez(France), two-time finisherJohn Kelly(U.S.), and three-time finisherJared Campbell(U.S.). They were also joined by Barkley hopefulsDamian Hall(U.K.), who started loop five last year but wasn’t able to finish it;Harvey Lewis(U.S.) andTomokazu Ihara(Japan), both of whom had attempted Barkley before; andIhor Verys(Ukraine, lives in Canada), a super strong ultrarunner starting for the first time. While Dunn tweeted that early on that Laz said, “The theme for the first loop this year is that you have to be able to navigate for yourself,” groups stayed together, and a group of five came in off of loop two together, including Kelly, Hall,Sébastien Raichon(France), and Verys in 19:27:49. It’s worth noting they were joined by two-time Fun Run finisher Jasmin Paris. A brief 17-minute stop saw the first racers heading out for lap three. Meanwhile,Greig Hamilton(New Zealand), Campbell, andMaxime Gauduin(France) finished their second loop in 19:52:36.Albert Herrero(Spain) and Sanchez followed at 20:26:04, and Ihara andThomas Dunkerbeck(The Netherlands) came in together at 22:08:53. The brutal course continued to take its toll on racers with multi-time Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra winner and record-holder Lewis dropping on his second loop. Sanchez tapped out on lap three saying, “I don’t know how I did that last year.” Ihor Verys wins the 2024 Barkley Marathons on his first attempt. Photo: Howie Stern The leaders marched on with Verys finishing loop three in 31:31:47. He was followed by Kelly and Hall just five minutes back in 31:36:57. Hamilton, Campbell, Raichon, Herrero, Gauduin, and Ihara all came in to complete loop three over the course of the next five hours and headed out for number four. When you add Jasmin Paris in the women’s race, who was firmly in the mix, it made it a record-breaking 10 runners out on lap four. But as all Barkley runners and fans know, starting four laps does not always guarantee a finish, and Gauduin, Ihara, and Herrero all dropped during this loop. In rapid succession, between 45:46 and 46:19, some five men finished loop four, in order Kelly, Verys, Hamilton, Hall, and Campbell. Verys returned to the course first, after about a 20-minute break, choosing the clockwise direction for his fifth and final lap. It was only a matter of minutes until all the other men trailed out, in opposite directions of each other. After a small time gap, Raichon was the last to finish loop four, nabbing a time of 47:45:39. Dunn reported he took a wrong turn toward the end of the loop and had to go back out to correct it before receiving credit for the lap. With a quick turnaround in camp, Raichon made it back onto the course to start the fifth lap just three minutes before the cutoff to do so at 48 hours elapsed. Including Paris in the women’s race, that made seven folks on the course for five laps, a record number of loop-five starters. A lot of anxious waiting among ultrarunning fans in Frozen Head State Park and the world over followed for the race’s final 12 hours. With less than two hours on the clock, Ihor Verys was the first to touch the yellow gate in a time of 58:44:59. According to Dunn, he quipped, “Maybe you should add a sixth loop.” Now three-time Barkley finisher John Kelly came in shortly after in a time of 59:15:38. Jared Campbell finished a record fourth Barkley in 59:30:32, telling Laz afterward, “That new section is brutal. You are a bad man.” Greig Hamilton also made it back to the finish under the 60-hour cutoff with a time of 59:38:42. You can get to know some of the men’s finishers viathis 2019 profile of Jared Campbellandthis entertaining race report by John Kelly of his first Barkley finish in 2017. While Damian Hall and Sébastien Raichon ultimately tapped out without completing their fifth lap, it was a huge year for “the race that eats its young,” as it is called.

2024 Transgrancanaria Classic 126k Results: Courtney Dauwalter Repeats and Raul Butaci Wins,"At the stroke of midnight, on Saturday, February 24, more than 750 runners set out for the 2024Transgrancanaria Classic 126k, the main event of the Transgrancanaria festival of races on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria off of the coast of Morocco. Traveling 78.3 miles (126 kilometers) of mountainous terrain from Las Palmas on the northern tip of the island to the southern end in Maspalomas, the race route offers up more than 22,300 feet (6,800 meters) of elevation gain and is an early season classic that always draws big names in the trail running world. This year, the event was the third race in the World Trail Majors series. All eyes were on last year’s returning women’s champion,Courtney Dauwalter(U.S.), who was coming back to racing after a big break following her massive 2023 race campaign. Also looking to vie for the top spot wasClaudia Tremps(Spain), who finished third in 2023 and 2022 and second in 2021.Azara García(Spain) was also aiming to make a mark. On the men’s side, 2023 winnerAndreu Simon(Spain) was back, as wasMiguel Arsénio(Portugal), who was looking to improve on his 2023 second place.Raul Butaci(Romania, lives in Spain), who finished fourth in 2023, was also on the start line.Zach Miller(U.S.) arrived hoping for a strong showing in his Transgrancanaria debut. Courtney Dauwalter made it through a night of challenging weather to enjoy blue sky running on her way to her second Transgrancanaria win. Photo: Transgrancanaria/Ian Corless The midnight start is a fairly unique feature for this race, and while runners started in dry conditions, it didn’t take long for the weather to unleash. Strong winds, fog, cold temperatures, and ample precipitation continued in the dark before easing off to cloudy skies at daybreak. Good running weather conditions prevailed for the second half of the race as runners made their way across the southern reaches of the island. While Dauwalter led the women from start to end in dominating fashion, finishing in 15:14:54, the men’s race saw many lead changes and shakeups amongst the top five throughout the race. In the end, it would be Butaci with a strong mid-race move to come out on top in 13:22:32 ahead ofMiguel Heras(Spain) andIonel Manole(Romania, lives in Spain) in second and third places, respectively. It’s hard to bet againstCourtney Dauwalter(U.S.) when it comes to race like Transgrancanaria. While last year, it took Dauwalter a little bit to work her way into the lead, this year she went straight to the front and opened up nearly a two-minute gap to the next woman within the first hour of the race. Donning a jacket as the weather deteriorated but still smiling through the wind, rain, and fog of the night, she moved efficiently through the check points and ran with the stride of a rested and happy runner enjoying a night out in the mountains. Courtney Dauwalter took the lead of the women’s race early and never gave it up. Photo: Transgrancanaria/The Adventure Bakery By Fontanales, 42 kilometers in, Dauwalter’s lead was nearly 15 minutes overAzara García(Spain) and 21 minutes overClaudia Tremps(Spain).Emma Stuart(Ireland) ran in fourth just under half an hour back, andMaria Mercedes Pila(Ecuador, living in Spain) rounded out the top five. Positions in the top five stayed the same through Artenara at 65 kilometers with the coming of the day, with the gaps continuing to open with now a full hour between Dauwalter in the lead and Pila in fifth. Things started to shake up for the women as they headed toward the course highpoint. At the Garañon checkpoint at 89 kilometers, Dauwalter led Tremps by 39 minutes after García dropped from the race. Tremps and García had left Tejeda (77k) together, but García returned to the aid station with dizziness. Stuart moved into third, an hour back from the leader, andDominika Stelmach(Poland) ran in fourth, an hour and a half back from the charging Dauwalter.Anouk Baars(The Netherlands) rounded out the top five. Over the high point and now under sunny skies, the gaps between the top women only increased as each settled into their paces on the long descent toward the finish. Courtney Dauwalter would finish in a time of 15:14 ahead of Claudia Tremps who came across the line in 16:27. Emma Stuart continued to run a strong and consistent race to round out the podium in 16:50 about an hour ahead of Dominika Stelmach, who took fourth in 17:49.

Leaving the start line in Las Palmas under a cloudy skies, it wasn’t long before the favorites set a fast pace at the pointy end of the race. Going over several climbs on their way to the Fontanales checkpoint at kilometer 42, it wasZach Miller(U.S.),Miguel Heras(Spain), andMiguel Arsénio(Portugal) running within a minute of each other just over four hours into the race. All seemed to be coping with the deteriorating weather well as rain and wind pelted the field and the fog closed in. All within six minutes of the lead,Ionel Manole(Romania, lives in Spain),Andreu Simon(Spain),Jia-Sheng Shen(China), andRaul Butaci(Romania, lives in Spain) stayed within close distance of the lead trio. Zach Miller started fast at his debut Transgrancanaria and finished seventh. Photo: Transgrancanaria/The Adventure Bakery Reaching the middle of the course at Artenara at 65 kilometers and the start of the day high in the mountains of the island, little had changed in overall standings. Arsénio now led with a two-and-a-half minute lead over Miller and Heras while Butaci, showing his experience with on course, started to close the gap to third, now just 45 seconds off of a podium spot, while Manole and Simon stayed in close pursuit. With daybreak came better weather for the field. Cloudy morning skies greeted racers as they started in on the southern half of the island traverse. Over the second highest point of the course and into the Tejeda checkpoint, Butaci made his move on the field. Now eight hours into the race, the Romanian put in a major surge to run himself into the lead alongside Arsénio, who would drop with a hamstring injury at 77 kilometers in Tejeda. Heras trailed under two minutes back while Miller seemed to be paying for his fast start, now nearly six minutes off of the lead. Over Garañon, nearly at the high point of the race 89 kilometers in, Arsénio had dropped from the race and Butaci increased his lead over Heras to more than two minutes. Manole slotted into third position. Miller continued to fall back while a chasing trio of Simon, Shen, andAbel Carretero(Spain) all ran together to round out the top seven. Starting the major descent out of the mountains, the men bombed down to Tunte at kilometer 101 with Butaci increasing his lead to more than five minutes over second. Nearly home at Ayagaures with only one smaller climb until the finish, the gap between first and second was nearly eight minutes. While Heras and Manole continued to hold onto second and third, Carretero made a huge move to work himself into fourth place and within striking distance of the podium if only he had more time. In the end, he would fall just 36 seconds short of a podium spot. In the end, Raul Butaci took the win with a time of 13:22, Miguel Heras finished second in 13:32, and Ionel Manole took the final podium spot in 13:49. Abel Carretero finished in 13:49 and Jia-Sheng Shen rounded out the top five in 14:04:40. Former champion Andreu Simon held onto sixth position in 14:07, and Zach Miller finished seventh in 14:10.

2024 Tarawera by UTMB 102k Results: Kiwis Ruth Croft and Daniel Jones Take Home Wins,"Many people who follow ultrarunning expectedRuth Croft(New Zealand) andDaniel Jones(New Zealand) to win theTarawera by UTMB 102kon Saturday, February 17, in New Zealand. After all, the 2022 Western States 100 winner Croft’s last race was a dominant win at the Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k this past November, and Jones, the defending champion, is coming off an impressive 2023 that included a 12th-place finish at UTMB and fifth-place finish at the Western States 100. Combine that with running your country’s biggest ultra and the extra attention that brings, and there was no shortage of pressure and expectation on the Kiwi duo. But Croft and Jones seemed to thrive on it, as they both took home commanding wins in their respective races through the lush forests and cascading waterfalls of Rotorua, a city on New Zealand’s North Island. It was both runners’ second wins at Tarawera, with Croft winning in 2021 and Jones victorious last year. Starting under a morning fog, 726 runners began their way through the 63.5-mile course that featured more than 10,000 feet of elevation gain. The temperatures climbed as the race wore on even with decent cloud coverage, with many runners — Croft among them — using sponges soaked in cold water, among other techniques, to cool off. Since its inception 15 years ago, the Tarawera 102k has attracted some of the sport’s top talent and served as a bellwether of sorts for the upcoming ultra calendar. After Croft and Jones’ convincing wins, it’s hard not to believe they are destined for another strong year. Read on for the full race details. [Editor’s Note:This article was written by guest contributorRobbie Harms.] Ruth Croftentered the first checkpoint at Lake Rotokakahi about 13.5 miles into the race in the lead and never looked back.Beth McKenzie(U.S., lives in Australia) was less than two minutes behind at that point, but Croft’s lead grew steadily; by the time they reached the first Millar Road checkpoint, at just over a marathon, she led by nearly five minutes, and by the time she got to Lake Tikitapu, it had grown to 11 minutes. McKenzie, an Ironman champion triathlete running in her first 100k, capped off a strong debut by finishing second. [From 2016 to 2018, Beth McKenzie (nee Gerdes) served a two-year doping sanction after testing positive at the 2016 Ironman Australia for ostarine, a prohibited selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM).] New Zealand’sNikki Evertonwas the other runner in the mix, running in third consistently throughout the race. Everton improved her finish from last year’s race by 10 places to earn a spot on the podium. This race belonged to Croft, though, and as she methodically built her lead it was up to her to simply keep her composure and not make any mistakes. She happily ran with young locals who sprinted next to her and enjoyed several cold-sponge showers at aid stations before crossing the finish line first for the second time in three years. It wasSarah Ludowici(Australia) andKatie Wright(U.K., lives in New Zealand) who took fourth and fifth places in the women’s race. Ruth Croft, 2024 Tarawera by UTMB 102k champion.

At the first checkpoint, he was three minutes ahead of ultimate sixth-place finisherMichael Dimuantes(Australia) before keeping his foot on the gas. He was focused and intentional at aid stations, methodically filling his bottles and cooling himself off to maintain his lead, which grew to double-digit minutes. Justin Grunewald(U.S.) was his closest challenger all day, running a smart and strong race. He was in fifth at the first checkpoint but made it up to second by the Okataina checkpoint about 36 miles in, a place he wouldn’t relinquish. Grunewald, who had two impressive third-place finishes at the Grindstone by UTMB 100k and the Canyons by UTMB 100k in 2023, finished about 40 minutes behind Jones. Sage Canaday(U.S.) andMatthew Healy(South Africa) battled for the final podium spot. Canaday moved from seventh to third from miles 13 to 36 before Healy, who stayed in the top five the entire race, used a strong stretch from the second Millar Road checkpoint at mile 47 to Lake Tikitapu at mile 54 to move up two places to third, where he would remain until he crossed the finish line.

2024 Black Canyon 100k Results: Hayden Hawks Breaks Course Record and Rachel Drake Takes the Win,"When the 2024Black Canyon 100kwas said and done,Hayden Hawksset a new men’s course record,Rachel Draketook the win in the women’s race, six men and women took homeWestern States 100Golden Ticket entries, and all the event’s participants weathered some incredibly unique winter conditions in the Arizona desert. All in all, it was a big day for American trail ultrarunning. The 2024 Black Canyon 100k took place on Saturday, February 10. After several weather delays, the race started at 9:30 a.m. local time. The Black Canyon 100k is a point-to-point race that takes in 5,578 feet (1,700 meters) of elevation gain and 7,703 feet (2,348 meters) of descent. The race is held on the Black Canyon Trail, which is made up of singletrack, jeep roads, and an old stagecoach route. The Black Canyon 100k is part of the newly formed World Trail Majors series and, importantly, a chance for elite runners to get their Golden Ticket entry to theWestern States 100. Three men’s and three women’s Golden Tickets were up for grabs at this year’s race among the top finishers, so there was a lot to fight for. Before the race had even begun, there was drama. Due to snowfall overnight, transport to the race was delayed, therefore the race was postponed. The race was also reduced from three to two waves to get everything underway as quickly as possible. This could have impeded the athlete’s nutritional strategies, and the disruption may have had a psychological impact on some. But what beauty there was to see snow in the desert, a rare occurrence! Read on for the full race story. A chilly start to the 2024 Black Canyon 100k. All photos: Jesse Ellis/Let’s Wander Photography It was an incredibly quick start to the race, with the men’s top 20 sticking side by side up until the first aid station at Antelope Mesa, 7.6 miles in.Matthew Seideltook the lead, passing through the checkpoint at 49:28, followed byHayden Hawks,Bobby Peavey, andHans Troyer. The top 10 men came through within 11 seconds of each other, so it was tight. This continued through checkpoint three at Bumble Bee, 19.2 miles into the race, where Seidel, Troyer, and Hawks all passed through the checkpoint within one minute of each other. It was at checkpoint four, Gloriana Mine around mile 24, that things started to heat up in the men’s race. Hawks and Troyer were ahead, and both reached the checkpoint in 2:35, one minute in front of the rest of the competition. Hayden Hawks on his way to winning the 2024 Black Canyon 100k. Troyer, fresh out of college, managed to stay with veteran Hawks until Cottonwood Gulch where he dropped back and eventually went to fifth place by Table Mesa, just over 50 miles in. In the meantime, Hawks managed to hold pole position whilstChris MyersandJupiter Carera Casas(Mexico) moved up to fill the remaining podium positions. As the race came to a close, it was less about who was going to win the race, but whether Hawks was going to set a new course record. Passing through Doe Springs with a little over three miles to go, he was going 34 seconds faster than the previous course record, 7:32:50,set byAnthony Costalesin 2023. After coming back from knee surgery six months previous, and suffering a DNF at last year’s Western States 100, not only did Hawks finish in first place, but he also managed to bag a course record at 7:30:18. He was followed by Jupiter Carera Casas in 7:39:56 for second, and Chris Myers in third place in 7:43:02, with the top three men accepting their Golden Ticket entries to the 2024 Western States 100. Some later drama in the men’s race occurred between ninth and 10th place, whenNate Jewkespipped Hans Troyer to the post with a sprint finish. Full results. The women’s race was a game of strategy and started withHeather Jacksonleading the pack by one minute at checkpoint one, 7.6 miles in, coming in at 54:06.Rachel DrakeandAnna McKenna(Australia) followed shortly behind. As the race went on, Jackson continued to widen the gap between her and her competitors. By the 12.8-mile mark, there was more than a two-minute gap between her and then second-placeSarah Biehl. The women in positions two to six were all close to one another. Jackson held the lead through Black Canyon City, 37.7 miles in, but in the less than nine miles that followed to Cottonwood Gulch,Becca Windelland Drake had closed the gap and moved 16 minutes clear of Jackson, with Windell narrowly leading Drake through the checkpoint. From here, Jackson dropped back, whilst Drake and Windell went head-to-head for the remaining miles. Windell had an incredible race, attacking from fifth place all the way up to third, then battling it out with Drake during the second half of the 100k. But, the moment that Drake took the race was on the final river crossing. Both athletes were running together until this point, and it was only when they were exiting the river that Drake took the opportunity to drive ahead and take the lead. From there, it was her race.

2024 Hong Kong 100k Results: Lin Chen Storms Women’s Race While Guang-Fu Meng Takes Surprise Men’s Win,"The 2024Hong Kong 100kkicked off at 8 a.m. local time on Saturday, January 21, on the Sai Kung Peninsula, located on the east side of Hong Kong. This year’s women’s winner,LinChen(China), stormed through much of the race in first position, while the men’s champion,Guang-Fu Meng(China), made a surprise attack on the last climb to finish in first position, knocking last year’s winner off the top spot. This 103-kilometer (64 miles) race has over 5,300 meters of elevation gain (17,388 feet) and is one of three races that took place across the weekend — along with the half (56k/35 miles) and the third (33k/21 miles). Athletes can compete in individual races, or have the opportunity to compete in all three for a chance to win the event’s grand slam. The Hong Kong 100k is also the first of nine races in the inaugural 2024 World Trail Majors series. As expected, conditions were extremely humid throughout the race, which may have been a struggle for European athletes, who will currently be training through winter conditions back home. The women’s race began with an early lead from one of the favoritesDominika Stelmach(Poland), however it was Lin Chen who dominated the race and finished in 12:44:51. In the men’s race there was a shock finale from Guang-Fu Meng who overtookPei-Quan You(China) on the final climb of the race, and crossed the finish line in 10:16:56. Read on for the full story. The start of the 2024 Hong Kong 100k. All photos: World Trail Majors/Anta Brand AlthoughDominika Stelmach(Poland) was ahead very early in the race, she came into the first checkpoint alongsideLinChen(China), and from there on it was Chen’s race. With each passing kilometer, Chen increased the gap between her and the rest of the field. Chen came into checkpoint six at Kei Ling Ha, 57 kilometers in, in 6:16:20, with 20 minutes between her andYing Li(China), who was by then in second place. These two were followed by Stelmach, who hit the checkpoint shortly afterward. By checkpoint eight at Beacon Hill, 78k in, the gap between first and second had increased to 26 minutes, as Chen entered the checkpoint in 9:17:56. From there to the finish line, there was very little doubt that Chen had taken gold and was described as looking strong and composed throughout. Lin Chen crossed the finish line in 12:44:51, taking first place in the women’s race. Chen also won the 2023 Doi Inthanon by UTMB 100 Mile in Thailand only a month ago, which is part of the Western States 100 Golden Ticket Series and at which she accepted that ticket. She also indicated after finishing the Hong Kong 100k that she plans to race UTMB this year. Whilst Chen stormed the race, there was a shock retirement from Stelmach who dropped out of the race 11.5 hours in. Ying Li maintained second place throughout the race, and although she wasn’t able to close in on Chen, she crossed the finish line in second with a time of 13:39:30. Unlike the top two positions, there was a lot more competition for third place.Ting Ma(China) retained third place for most of the second half of the race. But all the while,Yuan-Yuan Wu(China) was slowly creeping up the leaderboard, and there was a fierce battle between the two in the closing stages of the race, where they went head-to-head during the final climb. However, it was Yuan-Yuan Wu who came out on top, and took third place in 13:54:08, running with her son across the finish line. Lin Chen, the 2024 Hong Kong 100k women’s champion. Full results. The competition was much closer in the men’s race, with a shock win fromGuang-Fu Meng(China) at the very end of the race. This year’s favorite to win was last year’s winner and course record holderPei-Quan You(China). Even after this year’s race, his incredible 2020 record still stands at 10:00:17. From the offset, You took the lead and from checkpoint three at 34k onward, Meng dipped between second and third place. By checkpoint eight, 78k in, the gap had increased, with You taking a 12-minute lead on Meng, and still looking very comfortable in pole position. However, it was the final checkpoint where the competition started to heat up. With 10k to go, there was only a five-minute gap between the competitors, and although it looked like You still had the race in the bag, Meng did the impossible. He managed to overtake on the final uphill to the highest peak of the race — and of Hong Kong — Tai Mo Shan. Guang-Fu Meng took first place in the men’s race, finishing in 10:16:56, and Pei-Quan You took second in 10:35:11. Tyler Greenfrom the U.S. also had a strong race, climbing from 12th to third place by the 70k mark. From here on, he managed to maintain his position and finished the race in 10:38:12, only minutes behind You. The 2024 Hong Kong 100k men’s podium (l-to-r): 3. Tyler Green, 1. Guang-Fu Meng, and 3.

"2024 Winter Spine Race Results: Jack Scott Shatters Course Record, Claire Bannwarth Claims Second Win","The 2024Spine Racewas one for the record books, withJack Scott(U.K.) taking redemption for his narrow defeat toDamian Hall(U.K.) in last year’s race, by claiming a decisive win and a new course record. Scott’s time of 72 hours, 55 minutes, and 5 seconds carved 10 hours, 17 minutes, and 18 seconds offJasmin Paris’shistoric 2019 overall course record. Claire Bannwarth(France) became the first woman in Spine Race history to secure back-to-back wins at the race, and her 92-hour, 2-minute, and 23-second victory also took more than 5 hours off of her winning time from 2023. The 268-mile race runs the length of the Pennine Way in England, from south to north, finishing in Kirk Yetholm on the Scottish border. It takes racers through some of the most remote parts of the country, in invariably brutal conditions. Conditions for this year’s race were bright and clear for the first part of the week, but bitterly cold, with a diversion forced due to extreme ice on the course. In the second half of the week, the blue skies gave way to heavy snowfall. Read on to see the full breakdown of the men’s and women’s races.

Photo: Spine Race/@willbaldlygo Spine Race enthusiasts will recall that the 2022 men’s race began with a duo ofKim Collison(U.K.) andDamian Hall(U.K.) pushing the pace hard at the front of the race, before both unfortunately succumbed to injury and were forced to withdraw. This year’s race started in a somewhat similar vein, with Collison taking up the lead from early on. Through the first checkpoint, 44 miles in, the top three were Collison,Konrad Rawlik(Poland, lives in U.K.), andDave Phillips(U.K.), with the chasing pack not far behind.

Over the duration of the first night, the attritional course also claimed strong contendersPavel Paloncy(Czech Republic) andSimon Roberts(U.K.). By the second checkpoint at Hawes, 103 miles in, Collison was still in the lead, with 23 hours and 41 minutes on the clock. Hall and Rawlik followed in second and third, about 15 minutes back. Eventual championJack Scott(U.K.) came through this point withJames Nobles(U.K.), relaxed in joint fourth position, 40 minutes back of the lead. The end of the second day saw further disruption when, reminiscent of 2022, race leader Collison was forced to retire at CP3 Langdon, 143 miles into the race, leaving Hall to take up the lead. But before the next checkpoint, the race began to mirror last year’s, as Scott caught up with Hall before mile 156, with the pair sharing some of the trail before Scott pulled away. Coming into CP4 Alston, around mile 175, with a lead of almost an hour, Scott was fully in race mode — reportedly in and out of the checkpoint “in F1 fashion” and with “razor sharp focus.” For the near-100 miles that followed, Scott continued to put more distance on Hall — but also, move further ahead of both Jasmin Paris’s overall course record, and Hall’s men’s course record of 84 hours, 36 minutes, and 24 seconds. After 268 miles, Jack Scott touched the wall in Kirk Yetholm with 72:55:05 on the clock. Damian Hall followed in second, in a personal best time of 82:25:10, also under both previous course records. Konrad Rawlik rounded out the men’s podium in 85:47:12. An emotional Jack Scott after winning the 2024 Winter Spine Race in a new men’s course record time.

Photo: Spine Race/Wild Aperture Photography There were fewer attritions at the sharp end of the women’s race, with eventual winnerClaire Bannwarth(France) asserting her dominance early on. At CP1 Hebden, 44 miles in, Bannwarth had already established herself in front, with 10 hours and 56 minutes elapsed. Bannwarth, who won last year’s Winter Spine Race, went on to have a superb 2023 — winning amongst others theTrailcat 200 Mile, theKodiak Ultramarathon by UTMB 100 Mile, and theTahoe 200 Mile, as well as placing fifth at theHardrock 100and 16th atUTMB. Hannah Rickman(U.K.), who placed second behind Bannwarth at last year’s Winter Spine Race, and won the 2023 Summer Spine Sprint (on a 46-mile section of the route), followed in second, about 19 minutes back of the lead.

Photo: Spine Race Elaine Bisson(U.K.) entered the checkpoint in third place, just 6 minutes behind Rickman, but took some time to recoup and prepare for the next section.Lucy Gossage(U.K.) was in next, and made a swift turnaround in the checkpoint to emerge in third position, with fell running legendNicky Spinksamong the chasing pack. Crossover athlete Gossage previously competed in triathlon before transitioning to ultrarunning, and has many Ironman victories to her name. While Bannwarth continued to pull away in front, by CP3 Langdon, Gossage had moved into second position by a margin of 51 minutes.

Photo: Spine Race/Wild Aperture Photography Rickman, however, was later awarded a 1-hour and 46-minute time bonus for a Good Samaritan act. She and another runner (G Brian Hutchinson, who was 10th in the men’s race) reportedly delayed their race to assist a fellow competitor who was suffering from fatigue along on a challenging part of the route, and escorted him to safety. By CP 5 Bellingham, Bannwarth was now almost 7 hours clear of Gossage in second, who now also had a sizeable lead — of more than 5 hours — on Rickman in third. Bannwarth eventually touched the wall, victorious, in a time of 92 hours, 2 minutes, and 23 seconds — taking 5 hours and 37 minutes off her previous winning time. Rickman truly rallied in the later stages of the race, closing in on Gossage. Gossage crossed the line before her, in a time of 106 hours, 5 minutes, and 26 seconds — but the time bonus meant that Rickman was awarded second place in a time of 104:41:46. The close battle and dynamic race for second place made for nail-biting dot-watching, even if Bannwarth’s victory was never in doubt.

2024 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all the runners who secured places in the 2024Hardrock 100! The Hardrock 100 is a 100-mile race through Colorado’s San Juan Mountains, starting and finishing in Silverton. The challenging and gorgeous route packs in 33,000 feet of elevation, often at altitudes above 13,000 feet. It alternates direction each year, and will run clockwise in 2024. The ultimate bucket list race, the Hardrock 100 is notoriously difficult to gain entry into, with 2,796 applying for this year’s lottery alone. Unlike the Western States 100, which offers several avenues to gain entry in addition to an even more difficult lotto, the only way to secure a guaranteed entry into the Hardrock 100 is to win the previous year’s race. The 2024 Hardrock 100 will start 146 runners. Below, we list top competitors on the current entrants list as well as those high enough on the waitlists to have a chance of getting in. Then, we explain how the lottery operates, as well as break down some of the demographics of this year’s lottery and its lucky selected runners. Courtney Dauwalter wins the 2023 Hardrock 100 in course record time. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The only way to gain automatic entry to the Hardrock 100 is by winning and the 2023 women’s championCourtney Dauwalterwill be back to defend her title.

Photo: iRunFar Bryon Powell The 2024 lottery is divided into two categories, the Never Finished and Finished divisions: For 2024, 73 runners were selected from each category. From 2022 onward, the Hardrock 100 organization adopted a new policy whereby the same proportion of female runners who enter the lottery will be selected to run the race. Therefore, the draw is essentially drawn into four sections: Female Never, Female Finished, Male Never, and Male Finished. Returning champions are given automatic entrance to the event. The 2023 women’s champion Courtney Dauwalter has accepted that entry, while 2023 men’s champAurélien Dunand-Pallazdeclined it. Each year, race directorDale Garlandalso handpicks six entrants who bypass the lottery. Explained on the organization’s website, “In 2024, six such runners will be selected, evenly split between men and women, from a slate of at least 12 applicants proposed by the RD and approved by the Hardrock Board of Directors.” In prior years, the names of these picks were kept confidential. For Hardrock 2024, the organization is releasing those names. This year, those runners were: Related articles:"
"2023 IAU 24-Hour World Championships Results: Women’s World Record for Miho Nakata, Alexander Sorokin Repeats Men’s Win","At the 2023IAU 24-Hour World Championshipsin Taipei,Miho Nakata(Japan) set anew women’s world recordandAleksandr Sorokin(Lithuania) repeated his win from 2019. Nakata covered a distance of 167.996 miles (270.363 kilometers) and Sorokin ran 187.530 miles (301.800 kilometers). This year’s race, held on a 1.24-mile (2 kilometers) loop, took place on Friday and Saturday, December 1 and 2, and kicked off at 10 a.m. local time on Friday. The IAU 24-Hour World Championships are one of the biggest events in ultrarunning and haven’t been held since 2019 due to COVID-19 restrictions. Unlike many other races, athletes are not only competing as individuals but are also working to score points as a team for their country’s team rankings. In the women’s race, expectations were high for the last edition’s winner and 24-hour record holderCamille Herron(United States), but in the end it was Nakata who stole the show and broke Herron’s world record by a super-slim margin of 807 feet (246 meters), what amounts to a little over half a lap of a track. In the men’s race, as predicted by many, Sorokin emerged as champion after creating a large gap between himself and the rest of the field. While Sorokin was aiming to also set a world record, he wasn’t able to maintain the requisite pace in the last 5 or so hours, though he still finished first by a wide margin. We dive deeper into the race below. Japan’s Miho Nakata celebrates after setting a new women’s 24-hour world record at the 2023 IAU 24-Hour World Championships in Taipei on December 1 and 2. Photo: International Association of Ultrarunners As expected, the top athletes remained close to one another in the early couple hours of the race, and then things began to string out. By some five hours in, Herron, the 2019 champion and world-record holder, sat in third place, two minutes back from the lead, while eventual championMiho Nakata(Japan) was already leading. At the halfway point, the women’s podium positions were composed of Nakata, Herron, andLine Caliskaner(Norway). Some 16 hours in, Nakata continued to build her lead, but second and third places shuffled, withCarmen Maria Perez(Spain) andNoora Honkala(Finland) now in those spots. One of the biggest shocks of the women’s race came when Herron withdrew at about 88 miles (142k), just under 12 hours into the event. Only nine weeks prior, Herron won and broke the course record at the Spartathlon in Greece and said on social media after withdrawing that she didn’t feel fully recovered from that effort. Change came again at the 21-hour mark behind leader Nakata, whereOlena Shevchenko(Ukraine) had now moved up to second place and Perez down to third place. As the race progressed, all eyes were on Nakata, who was on track for breaking the world record, but the question was if she’d be able to hold pace through the finish. She needed every last second of those 24 hours to get the job done, surpassing the prior world record by a short distance. Read more about Nakata’s world record in ournews article. Shevchenko finished second with more than 157 miles (254k) andPatrycja Bereznowska(Poland) moved up late to round out the women’s podium. She finished with more than 154 miles (248.8k). In the women’s team race, Poland won, Japan took second, and the Czech Republic was third. Provisional results. Last year’s winner and current 24-hour world-record holderAleksandr Sorokin(Lithuania) was the heavy favorite, but did not go out as aggressively as the early frontrunners. It was almost six hours before Sorokin took the lead, and at the 12-hour mark, he was just short of his world record pace. Whilst Sorokin increased his gap on the field to 7.4 miles (12k) at the 16-hour mark,Fotios Zisimopoulos(Greece) ledAndrii Tkachuk(Ukraine) in a still close race for second and third place. Interestingly, while the women’s race for the podium shifted numerous times, this would be the men’s ultimate podium. With five hours left to race, the world record was out of Sorokin’s reach, but he was plenty strong enough to maintain that large gap. With four hours left to race,Francisco Mariano Martinez(Spain) sat at 150.3 miles (242k) in fourth place, challenging for the podium. After 24 hours, Sorokin finished with 187.530 miles (301.800k), well off his previous world record of 198.598 miles (319.614k). Zisimopoulos finished second with about 181 miles (292k) and Tkachuk finished third with about 176 miles (284k).

2023 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k Results: Mityaev and Croft Dominate the South African Race,"After a day of fierce heat and competition, the 2023Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100kcrownedDmitry Mityaev(Russia) andRuth Croft(New Zealand) as this year’s champions. The race started at 6 a.m. local time in Cape Town, South Africa, on Saturday, November 25. The 98-kilometer (61 miles) race is one of several that took place during the weekend festival. It is unique in its landscape, with mountains, beaches, and cityscapes throughout the ultra. The race began at Gardens Rugby Football Club and covered 4,972 meters (16,312 feet) of elevation gain. The route is front loaded in its climbing, with 1,700 meters of gain in the first 25k, scaling Table Mountain and Suther Peak. Race day was a hot one, with athletes drinking as much water as possible on route and at the checkpoints. At the checkpoints, race crews poured ice cubes in athletes’ packs and placed socks filled with ice across their necks to stop the athlete’s body temperature from rising in the midday heat. The race was set to be an exciting one, with last year’s men’s champion Mityaev returning to compete against favorites such asThibaut Baronian(France). Unfortunately,Tom Evans(U.K.), one of the men’s favorites, was missing from the start line after being held at knifepoint in Cape Town while training for the race. However, that didn’t stop him from cheering his Adidas Terrex teammates during the event. The women’s race appeared to be just as dramatic, withMarianne Hogan(Canada) competing in her second go at this event, after having taken second two years ago. However, she was a bit of a wild card given she’s been returning from injury. All things told, international superstar Croft was probably the women’s favorite. Read on for the full race story. Dmitry Mityaev on his way to winning the 2023 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k. Photo: iRunFar/Neville Sharwood Dmitry Mityaev’s(Russia) running career has gone from strength to strength in recent years, after running the fastest time ever in the mountain race at Mount Elbrus and winning this event last year, he was always going to be one of the strongest contenders. Right from the beginning Mityaev dominated, staying at the front of the pack up to the first checkpoint until he decided to break away and run alone for the rest of the race, and he never stopped. Between Table Mountain at 31k and Llandudno 41k, it appeared that Mityaev had taken a fall with a nasty gash on his left thigh. This was followed by a wrong turn after hopping from the roads and onto trails just before the Llandudno checkpoint. He could be forgiven because the rugged trail looked more like someone’s back garden than a running route. Needless to say, none of these setbacks stopped him and Mityaev came through the finish line at 10:43:06, 19 minutes ahead of his next opponent. Whilst Mityaev took the lead, competition was heating up between second, third, and fourth places.Caleb Olson(U.S.) andThibaut Baronian(France) were 10 minutes behind Mityaev coming into the checkpoint at Llandudno, followed closely byAnthony Costales(U.S.) andDarren Thomas(U.S.). Although as predicted Olson came in second at Hout Bay checkpoint at 57k, Baronian dropped back to fifth place behind and seemed to be dipping. However, Baronian managed to climb back up to fourth position for the remainder of the race until he crossed the finish line. Thomas would lose ground later, easing back to finish 10th. Whilst Mityaev crossed the line in first, the gaps grew larger between the rest of the competitors toward the end of the race. Americans filled the rest of the men’s podium, with Olson placing second at 11:02:28, followed by Costales in 11:24:08.

This year’s winner wasRuth Croft(New Zealand), also the 2022 Western States 100 champion. To win this race, Croft put in an incredible effort and dominated the women’s race throughout the course. She began head-to-head withMarianne Hogan(Canada), but after the fourth checkpoint at Table Mountain, 31k into the race, the gap began to increase between the two athletes. By checkpoint five at Llandudno, just 10k later, Croft had increased her lead by nine minutes and passed through at 4:55, just a few minutes behindBeth Pascall’scourse record pace. However, since Pascall’s record, the course has changed, making it harder to compare the course times. As the race progressed, Croft became an even stronger athlete and increased her lead. Whilst Croft appeared to be running her own race at the front, the competition was fierce between Hogan andEkaterina Mityaeva(Russia) for second and third place. At Table Mountain there was a widening gap, with Hogan seemingly taking the lead. This was promising for an athlete who was recovering from injury and matching similar times from her performance at this event in 2021 when she placed second. But during the latter half of the race, Hogan took a fall on a gravel sidewalk, and after this she was passed by Mityaeva who moved in to second place. Whilst the battle continued for second and third, Croft crossed the finish line to win in 12:12:20. Hogan managed to push back and finished in second place at 12:39:53, followed by Mityaeva in third in a very close 12:44:07. In doing so, Mityaeva improved upon her fourth-place finish at the race last year. Ruth Croft doing a bit of beach running en route to winning the 2023 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k.

"2023 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra Results: Harvey Lewis Wins After 108 Hours, 450 Miles of Running","Runners continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in backyard ultrarunning, and the 2023Big Dog’s Backyard Ultrawas no different. In the end, AmericanHarvey Lewisclaimed the title of last person standing, after a record-breaking 108 hours and 450 miles of running. We’ve now published anin-depth interviewwith Harvey Lewis. Harvey Lewis pauses between yards in the late stages of the 2023 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra. Photo: Mike Trimpe The race, which acts as the world championships of backyard ultrarunning, started at 7 a.m. local time on Saturday, October 21, in Bell Buckle, Tennessee. The format sees racers run a 4.166667-mile loop, called a “yard” in backyard ultrarunning, within a one-hour time limit, after which all finishers within the allotted time are tied for first place, and must present on the start line on the hour to go again. This continues until there is only one runner left standing, who must complete a solo yard to be awarded the win. In this particular event, athletes run two routes — a trail loop, which is run during the daylight hours, and a road loop, which the race switches over to at night. Remarkably, on Wednesday, October 25, a total of six runners passed the once seemingly insurmountable barrier of 100 hours. This group included 2021 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra winner,Harvey Lewis(U.S.); former joint backyard ultra world record holder,Merijn Geerts(Belgium); and most recent backyard ultra world record holder,Phil Gore(Australia). Over the course of the 101st yard, Geerts was timed out. Gore, along with Japan’sTerumichi Morishita, finished their 100th lap but failed to present themselves on the start on the next hour with the will to go again. And then there were three. Still standing after 101 hours were Harvey Lewis,Ihor Verys(Ukraine, lives in Canada), and Poland’sBartosz Fudali. With Gore’s world record of 102 yards, which he set in June of 2023 at the Dead Cow Gully Backyard Ultra in his home country, all each of these three needed to do was finish out the lap to become joint world record holders. After that, the race would go into new and uncertain territory. The final three (left to right), Bartosz Fudali, Ihor Verys, and Harvey Lewis at the 2023 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra, before Fudali decided not to continue. Photo: Mike Trimpe Of the three still in the race, Fudali had been running the fastest, completing the loops in an average time of 46 minutes, 51 seconds. Lewis was running slowest, averaging 52:23. Race directorGary Cantrell, akaLaz, noted on social media that: “Harvey Lewis looks to be the most endangered on an immediate basis, he runs the closest to the cutoff and sometimes seems to be struggling ….” He added, “None of that is any different than it was at the beginning of the race. About 50 runners that looked better than Harvey are watching from the sidelines.” All three runners made it through loops 102 and 103, jointly resetting the backyard ultra world record. But, in a surprising plot twist, Fudali refused to start the 104th yard, leaving two left in the race — Verys and Lewis. Harvey Lewis (left) and Ihor Verys (right) late in the race at the 2023 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra. Photo: Mike Trimpe Yards 104 to 106 progressed, with Verys finishing each of them around five minutes faster than Lewis, giving himself a few extra minutes of recuperation before the next loop began. On loop 107, it was Lewis who finished a couple minutes ahead of Verys. Yard 108 ushered in sunset on the runners’ fifth day of running, and they switched over the nighttime road loop. During loop 108, Ihor Verys returned to the start/finish line, choosing to not complete the loop and drop from the race. Harvey Lewis successfully completed yard 108, becoming the last person standing. Verys is credited with the assist on Lewis’s win. Ihor Verys earlier in the 2023 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra.

Prolific ultrarunner Bannwarth won the 2023 Montane Spine Race, and also in 2023 reset her own French women’s backyard ultra record to 48 yards. These past few days, she added another 12 hours to that total, running 250 miles over 60 hours before she was ultimately timed out.

Photo: Keith Knipling Another national women’s record holder, Canada’sAmanda Nelson, was the second-to-last woman standing, running 57 yards and adding one yard to her own personal best and her Canadian national record. Current women’s backyard ultra world record holder,Jennifer Russo(U.S.), was timed out after 53 laps. Fifty-seven-year-old Russo ran 311 miles over 74 hours at the Capital Backyard Ultra in June of 2023, breakingCourtney Dauwalter’sworld best for women of 68 yards. The backyard ultra format has been growing steadily in popularity since its inception in 2011 — and received a further boost by the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel and more traditional races were unfeasible — and along with this popularity have come mind-boggling achievements. Some 60 hours into this year’s Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra, race director Gary Cantrell posted on social media: “In 2019 the winner of Big’s did 60 yards. Right now we have 31 people out on the 60th yard. I think that is what they mean by exponential growth.” Related articles:"
2023 Diagonale des Fous Results: Commanding Wins by Schide and Dunand-Pallaz,"The 2023Diagonale des Fous, or “Diagonal of Fools,” kicked off at 9 p.m. local time in Saint Pierre, on the south coast of Réunion Island, a French department in the Indian Ocean, on Thursday, October 19. The unique 165-kilometer (102 miles) traverse, the longest race in the weekend-longGrand Raid Réunionfestival, begins on the south side of the island with a partial ascent of active volcano, Piton de La Fournaise, and follows a spectacular route through UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the lands of Réunion National Park to finish on the north coast in the capital city of Saint-Denis. The race takes in roughly 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) of climbing and as much descending, on brutally technical terrain, and is seen as one of the most difficult 100 milers on the global race calendar. This year’s race had a promising line-up, includingUTMB’s2022 winner,Katie Schide, and 2023 third-place manGermain Grangier. Fans were also thrilled with a surprising late addition — four-time Diagonale des Fous winnerFrançoisD’Haene, who has been absent from the scene for a time due to injury and was spotted on the start line sporting a hand-written bib. While women’s favorite Schide did not disappoint, with a commanding win over strong rivals including France’sCamille Bruyas; it was 2023Hardrock 100championAurélien Dunand-Pallazwho came out on top in the men’s race, with a similar runaway victory to what we saw from him at Hardrock. Read on to see how both these races played out. Katie Schidehas had two high profile second-place finishes this season — at theWestern States 100, where the American living in France finished in the second fastest women’s time ever on the historic route, and atOCC, where she demonstrated her versatility by stepping down a distance and still competing at the highest level. At Diagonale des Fous, it was clear from the start that she would be hard to beat — leading from the get-go, and always with a comfortable gap on 2022 Les Templiers winner,Camille Bruyas, of France, in second. Schide took it out hard from the first climb, and by Notre Dame De La Paix at 28k, already had an 18-minute lead on Bruyas. She gained even more ground on the second leg of the climb up to the race’s high point, Croisée Coteaux Kerveguen at 63.5k, where she topped out 29 minutes ahead of her chaser. Past the 100k point at Ilet À Bourse, she had stretched her lead further to an hour and 12 minutes, at this point looking impossible to catch. While Schide was out on her own for almost the entirety of the race, so too was Bruyas, who always had a big gap on the rest of the field and never looked to be in danger. Summiting Croisée Coteaux Kerveguen at 63.5k, she was 23 minutes clear of Réunion Island’s ownEmilie Maroteauxin third. It was a closer battle for third position, with Germany’sEva-Maria Spergerfollowing hot on Maroteaux’s heels, just two minutes behind at that point. Schide continued her tour de force for the remaining 60k or so of the race — which had fewer big climbs, but covered ankle-breaking volcanic terrain — and ultimately finished in 27:31:08, an hour and 26 minutes clear of Bruyas in second. Bruyas finished with an even bigger lead on Maroteaux in third. After some close running and trading of places with Sperger earlier in the race, Maroteaux managed to pull away, securing the final podium position and the first local home in the women’s race with another big margin.

Early on in his career, in 2012, FrenchmanAurélien Dunand-Pallazran the 73k race at Grand Raid Réunion, placing fourth. Was a seed planted then to come back eventually and take on the 100-mile win? Who knows, but he started this race like someone on a mission. By Notre Dame De La Paix — 28k into the race with just over 1,600 meters climbed — he was just over a minute ahead of then second-place, France’sGermain Grangier, but was not giving up his marginal lead. Reaching Coteaux Kerveguen at 61k — just before cresting the race’s high point at roughly 2,500 meters — Dunand-Pallaz had pulled 12 minutes clear of the rest of the field, with his countrymanLambert Santellithen following in second. Last year’s second-place man, Switzerland’sJean-Philippe Tschumi— after moving around in the top 10 for the first half of the race — crept up the field to second place after 85k. He came close enough to make Dunand-Pallaz sweat, running just three minutes back of the leader around the 100k mark. Tschumi held on to second for a long time, but Dunand-Pallaz reasserted his dominance, and had pulled more than a half hour clear of his chaser by Deux Bras at 128k, with most of the climbing done. It was here too that Grangier made a move into second position. Like Tschumi, Grangier had been moving around the top 10 for the race’s first half, before settling into third position from 92k onward. It was on the second-to-last climb up to Dos D’ane where he finally got ahead of Tschumi. Dunand-Pallaz continued to power ahead, ultimately finishing in 23 hours and 21 minutes, 39 minutes clear of Grangier in second. Tschumi followed in 24:28 for third, with Grangier having put significant time on him in the race’s closing section. Grand Raid legend, FrenchmanFrançoisD’Haenemay or may not be back to full race fitness. He was briefly in podium position around the halfway point but fell back a little to ultimately finish in eighth place. Mid-race, his social media channels indicated that he was suffering from leg cramps. We hope this is only the start of his comeback.

"2023 Pikes Peak Ascent Results: Bonnet Breaks Record, Laukli Leads Women","Oww, oww,Rémi Bonnetdid it! Bonnet ran 2:00:20 to become the fastest ever up 14,115-foot Pikes Peak. The record happened as part of the 2023Pikes Peak Ascenton September 16. The race started in the town of Manitou Springs, Colorado, and climbed 7,800 feet over an average 11% grade toward the high altitude finish on the mountain summit. The final three miles are all above treeline, and there was snow on the higher stretches this year. In the women’s race, OlympianSophia Lauklicontinues to dominate women’s mountain running, in this case running away from the rest of the field to finish about 3.5 minutes ahead of everyone else. Read on for the full race story. Rémi Bonnetwon last year’s race in 2:07:02, and so his run this year was significantly faster than his former best. The previous best wasMatt Carpenter’s2:01:06, run as part of the roundtrip Pikes Peak Marathon race in 1993. Carpenter’s full Marathon time that year was 3:16:39. That 1993 performance has been widely regarded as one of the stoutest records in mountain running. This year’s race was part of the Golden Trail World Series, and Bonnet earned a $3,000 first-place prize, but just missed a $10,000 time bonus for going under two hours. Bonnet has made his mark as an uphill ace in recent years and in the week leading up to the race, reset his own fastest known time on the Manitou Springs Incline, a mile-long, stair-stepped, 2,000-foot climb. This was his first race back after dropping from August’s Sierre-Zinal event in Switzerland. Patrick Kipngeno(Kenya), the two-time World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race winner, was second in 2:04:09, and that’s the third-best time ever up the mountain. Kipngeno trails only Bonnet and Carpenter on the all-time charts. Top AmericanEli Hemmingmoved up one place from a year ago and was third in 2:07:40. Two-time Pikes Peak Marathon winnerSeth Demooradded the Ascent as part of a double and was fourth in 2:09:47. Four-time race winnerJoseph Graytopped out in 2:11:19 for fifth.

No records fell in the women’s race, butSophia Laukli’shaving a world-best year. Already the Mont Blanc Marathon and Sierre-Zinal winner, Laukli picked up her third Golden Trail World Series win of the year. Laukli pulled away in the last two miles and won in 2:35:54. She was third in last year’s race in 2:34:30. A Nordic ski Olympian, Laukli is on the start list for next weekend’s Mammoth Trail Fest 26k, also part of the Golden Trail World Series, in California, but earlier shared on the Sub Hub podcast that she is unlikely to start that race. Second-placeJudith Wyder(Switzerland) summitted in 2:39:35, andAnna Gibsonwas a surprise third-place finisher in 2:43:59.

2023 UTMB Results: Dauwalter and Walmsley Lead American Sweep,"The 2023UTMBwas filled with question marks about who would end up standing on the top step of the podium, both for the men and women. On the women’s side, only a handful of the top 10 from the 2022 race were returning. If one were to ignore everything thatCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had previously done this summer, she would have been the odds-on favorite. But just seven weeks removed from setting a new course record at the Hardrock 100, which was just three weeks after doing the same at the Western States 100, no one knew how her seemingly super-human body and mind would hold up. But really, in hindsight, it was silly for anyone to worry about how the G.O.A.T. of trail ultrarunning would handle a third 100-mile race of her summer. Dauwalter once again showed that she is in a league of her own, leading the race from 32 kilometers in and never looking back. Her runaway victory resulted in a time of 23:29:14. For the men, with nine out of the top 10 men from 2022 returning, the depth of the field was unquestionable. And with Kilian Jornet out due to injury, it was anyone’s race. But, truth be told, most eyes were probably trained onJim Walmsley(post-race interview). After his second summer spent in Europe with a full focus placed on UTMB, would he finally be able to put together the race that everyone thought that he could? Would there finally be an American man who would crack the code of UTMB? It it wasn’t going to be Walmsley, could it beZach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) instead? For much of the race, it would have been difficult to discern which of the two Americans, or really any of the men running in the top 10, would come away with the victory as the lead changed hands multiple times and the gaps grew into the double-digit minutes on multiple occasions. But it in the end, it was Walmsley, the meticulous student of UTMB, who would finally be able to put all the pieces together and reach Chamonix first with a time of 19:37:43, a new course record. He becomes the first American man to win this iconic European race. At 172 kilometers (106.5 miles) in length and with some 10,000 meters (32,800) feet of climbing, the UTMB circles Mont Blanc in the Alps on one is arguably the most iconic course in trail ultrarunning. With a start in Chamonix, France, the final race at the end of a week of all things trail running and racing, the course leaves town and climbs quickly into the mountains into France, Italy, and then onto Switzerland before returning to Chamonix to the biggest finish line in the sport. It’s fair to say that this is the most competitive trail ultramarathon of the year, and the event serves up all the excitement that is expected of it. With its high level of prestige as the grand finale of the UTMB Mont Blanc festival, huge crowds come to watch the greats of the sport race over the rugged and wild course where anything can, and does, happen. The field heads off from Chamonix, France, for a long run in the mountains in the 2023 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein This year, 2,814 starters headed out from Chamonix at 6 p.m. on Friday, September 1, 2023, on a slightly modified course. Late in August, race organizers announced a change in the final segment of the race that added just under two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) to the overall distance but replaced a steep climb and technical descent with much gentler forest running, albeit still a climb. While this change suited some runners and was a disadvantage to others, in the end, it probably made very little difference in the outcome of any of the placings in the race. A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of UTMB possible! Thanks also toGoodrfor its support of our UTMB coverage. Was there actually any doubt that AmericanCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) would actually win UTMB? If her performances throughout the summer were any indication, it would have been foolish to bet against her. After winning and setting course records at both Western States 100 and Hardrock 100 earlier this summer, this win might just be the cherry on the cake, or thecerise sur le gateau, as the French would have it. The legend of the sport led from the early miles, and in typical Courtney fashion, seemed to smile and joke her way to the win with a time of 23:29:14. But the win didn’t come as easy as it may have seemed to people watching. While she continued to put on a smile for race volunteers and spectators, Dauwalter was deep in the pain cave after about 110 kilometers, sometimes wondering if her legs would actually keep her moving forward, all of the miles from earlier in the summer catching up to her. But luckily, she had just enough left in her to get her to Chamonix and the roar of the massive crowds. Courtney Dauwalter has her eye on the prize at the 2023 UTMB start line. iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein WhileEmma Pooley, of Switzerland, led for the initial kilometers of the race, it didn’t take long for Dauwalter to move to the front. Sporting her trademark smile and happily interacting with volunteers at aid stations whenever the opportunity presented itself, Dauwalter simply makes it look good. The top three women, Dauwalter, Pooley, and France’sBlandine L’Hirondel(post-race interview), came intoLes Contamines, 32 kilometers into the race, within seconds of each other. It would be the last time we would see the front of the race together, as byCol du Bonhomme,12 kilometers later, the gap between Dauwalter and second-placeManon BohardCailler, of France, was nearly 10 minutes. L’Hirondel and Chiina’sFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-race interview) came through another two minutes later. Germany’sKatharina Hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) came over the dark col another five minutes in arrears. The situation remained essentially unchanged through Les Chapieux at 51 kilometers and Lac Combal at 69 kilometers, except the gaps were growing. Nearly 10 hours into the race, Dauwalter came throughCourmayeur at 81 kilometers, not even bothering to stop at the aid station. Bohard continued to keep the gap manageable at 18 minutes, but it was really starting to look like another runaway victory for the American for the top step of the podium. But the race for the rest of the top spots was just starting to get interesting. L’Hirondel and Xiang remained close in third and fourth, just a few minutes back of Bohard, and Hartmuth continued to lurk another 20 minutes back. This early in the race, there were still many within striking distance. Katharina Hartmuth runs through Lac Combal, 69 kilometers into the 2023 UTMB, in the dark of night. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Coming throughRefuge Bertone at 86 kilometers, the top five remained unchanged and Canada’sAilsa McDonald, Poland’sKatarzyna Solińska, the U.S.’sSabrina StanleyandLeah Yingling, andClaudia Trempsof Spain filled out the top 10. Somewhere beforeArnouvaz at kilometer 99, Bohard took a fall that would ultimately take her out of the race. She entered the aid station walking gingerly, but was determined to keep going. This development opened up podium possibilities even further, and Xiang and L’Hirondel continued to run together at Grand Col Ferret, 50 minutes behind the ever-steady, smiling, and happy Dauwalter. Hartmuth was just 15 minutes off a podium position. With the arrival of Saturday morning came renewed spirits for many. Dauwalter arrived to sun atLa Fouly running 26 minutes under her own course-record pace. L’Hirondel and Xiang came in just under 50 minutes back, but now there was daylight, in the form of a couple of minutes, between the women. Hartmuth remained in fourth, 65 minutes down, Solińska in sixth, Yingling in seventh, and Spain’sMaite Maioracame through in eighth looking relaxed and focused. Stanley remained in the top 10. Bohard finally succumbed to injuries from her fall and would withdraw from the race. By La Giète, 130 kilometers in, the gap between Dauwalter and second place was over an hour, but the fight between the rest of the top five remained tight. Xiang moved into second and Hartmuth third, just minutes apart, as L’Hirondel began to feel the distance and time in her legs and dropped back to fourth place. Solińska and MacDonald continued in fifth and sixth, running together almost two hours behind Dauwalter. Courtney Dauwalter working hard just before Champex Lac during the 2023 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Jaja Ferer Capili Things remained relatively unchanged at Trient at 144 kilometers. Dauwalter looked good, Xiang was 66 minutes back, Hartmuth was a mere minute behind her, and L’Hirondel following next in fourth. Solińska and MacDonald followed another 50 minutes back, with Maiora trailing them by 15 minutes. With victory seemingly all but assured for the American, the battle for the other two podium spots started to get heated on the closing climbs and kilometers. Through Vallorcine at the base of the final major series of climbs,Hartmuth moved up into second after biding her time the entire race, now seven minutes ahead of third-placeXiang and fourth-place L’Hirondel, a further nine minutes back. Maiora led Solińska in fifth and sixth just under two hours behind the leader. Near the top of the final climb at Tête de Béchar, 161 kilometers in, it was Hartmuth in second, 56 minutes down. L’Hirondel moved into third 15 minutes back and Xiang kept the pressure on for the final podium spot, trailing by just four minutes. The next gap to Maiora remained about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, Dauwalter made short work of the final descent to the finish line in Chamonix, finishing in 23:29:14 and completing the ultimate trifecta of ultrarunning, winning the Western States 100, Hardrock 100, and UTMB all in one year. “Anytime you have a chance to take on a crazy challenge, I think we should,” she said afterward. The battle for the final two podium spots didn’t let up until the very end. Coming through La Floria, just four kilometers from the finish, Hartmuth led L’Hirondel by a mere nine minutes, and both women looked strong all the way to the finish. They would finish just over 40 minutes behind Dauwalter, Hartmuth in second at 24:10:52. L’Hirondel, the multi-time trail world champion, finished in third at24:22:50 for her debut 100 miler. Blandine L’Hirondel finished third at her debut 100-mile race, the 2023 UTMB nonetheless. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Xiang would fade away from podium contention in the final kilometers but held on for an incredible fourth-place finish, improving on her seventh place in 2022. But really, the excitement of her race finish was only added by receiving a marriage proposal on the finish line. Having met her now-fiancé — she said yes! — four years ago at UTMB, the proposal really was a perfect ending to her race. Maiora finished fifth, an impressive result after her DNF in the race in 2021. Pre-race favoritesMartina Valmassoi(pre-race interview) of Italy andEszter Csillag(pre-race interview), a Hungarian living in Hong Kong, withdrew from the race early. The women’s podium (l-to-r): 2.

Photo: iRunFar/Jaja Ferer Capili After a history of struggling with UTMB, the American men showed up this year withJim Walmsley(post-race interview) andZach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) taking the top two-spots on the podium. Two vastly different racers with different approaches to the event, the two were able to push each other from start to end, with Walmsley’s ever-consistent pace finally winning out in the end with a new course-record time of 19:37:43. But with a stacked field, with nine of last year’s top 10 back for another crack at the race, and last year’s championKilian Jornetout with injury, it was anyone’s bet throughout most of the race of who would come out on top. There’s never a non-chaotic start to UTMB, and this year was no different. With nerves and excitement running high, it was France’sArthur Joyeux-Bouillon(pre-race interview)who led at Saint-Gervais, 21 kilometers in, with the entire rest of the field hot on his heels. But as darkness fell on the race and the kilometers ticked by, several distinct groups began to form. Coming into Les Contamines, 32 kilometers in, it was Zach Miller, Jim Walmsley, and the U.K.’sTom Evans(pre-race interview)bunched up and running together. It looked like there would be the potential of a repeat of the Miller-Evans bromance from 2022, with the addition of Walmsley as a third. FrenchmanMathieu Blanchard(pre-race interview)andPetter Engdahl(pre-race interview), a Swede who lives in Norway,teamed up just a minute behind the leading trio, and the rest of the top-10 men came in within five minutes of the leaders. ByCol du Bonhomme at 44 kilometers, it was clear that Walmsley was there to put his mark on the race. Miller doggedly hung on 30 seconds back, and Evans came through another 30 seconds in arrears, looking decidedly worse than the two men in front of him. France’sGermain Grangier(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), Blanchard, Engdahl, and Joyeux-Bouillon continued to run together just eight minutes off the lead. Germain Grangier ran a consistent race to finish third at the 2023 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The head of the race remained amazingly consistent over the coming kilometers toCourmayeur, 81 kilometers into the race. Walmsley led Miller by a handful of minutes, Engdahl and Grangier followed, running close to each other in third and fourth, at under 20 minutes back after Evans decided to call it a day. Joyeux-Bouillon and Blanchard stayed within half an hour of the leader in fifth and sixth. Ever the aggressive racer, Miller made his move before Arnouvaz, 99 kilometers in. He came through the checkpoint leading a fatigued-looking Walmsley by two-and-a-half minutes. Many wondered if this was just another instance of Walmsley taking the early race out too hard and paying for it later. Grangier, Joyeux-Bouillon, and Engdahl all came through the checkpoint within 30 minutes of Miller, still well within striking distance if either of the two Americans fell back. The rest of the top-10 men also remained close, with a large group containing New Zeakland’sScotty Hawker, France’sThibaut Garrivier, Blanchard, Switzerland’sJean-Philippe Tschumi, and Germany’sHannes Nambergercoming in hot and fast. Coming over a dark and foggyGrand Col Ferret at 103 kilometers, Miller extended his lead to nearly four minutes, but Walmsley looked determined and seemed to have found a second wind. Grangier continued to hold strong just 12 minutes behind the leader, and the chase pack of the rest of the top 10 remained relatively unchanged with several of the men teaming up to run the final kilometers to daybreak together. It’s always a question of when the actual racing at UTMB starts. That is, when do runners make their move and hope that it sticks? Coming intoChampex-Lac at kilometer 126 on Saturday morning, it was starting to seem like perhaps Miller’s early move might be the one that worked for the American. With an 11-minute gap over Grangier and Walmsley, who were now running together, Miller looked strong and focused. But there was still a lot of racing to do, and a lot of mountains between him and the finish. Jim Walmsley leading the field into Courmayeur during the 2023 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Jaja Ferer Capili Whether Walmsley was actually in a spot of bother in the later hours of the night, or if it was all part of his strategy to hold back until daylight, everything changed when the sunlight lit up the Alps. By kilometer 139 atLa Giète, he’d whittled his gap to Miller down to two minutes, and by Trient six kilometers later, he’d moved back into the lead of the race, a position he wouldn’t relinquish. Grangier continued to run in third, with fourth, fifth, and sixth place, Joyeux-Bouillon, Blanchard, and France’sLudovic Pommeret, all moving together 44 minutes back from the battle up front. With the kilometers ticking by, Walmsley’s lead only continued to grow. At kilometer 154 atVallorcine, he was more than 13 minutes ahead of a struggling Miller. Seven kilometers later at Tête de Béchar, the gap was up to 16 minutes. From here, it would be just one more climb up to La Flégère before the course tipped downward to Chamonix. Grangier maintained his third place up the final climb, with Blanchard in fourth and Pommeret in fifth, more than an hour back on the leader. Garrivier ran in sixth, while Hawker and Joyeux-Bouillon were seventh and eighth, 92 minutes back from the lead. Once on the final descent, there was no touching Walmsley, and one can only imagine the thoughts and emotions that must have been going through his head. After five attempts at the race, the ultimate student of the course had finally figured out how to put together the race everyone thought he was capable of. He crossed the finish line to huge cheers from the crowd with a time of 19:37:43, breaking Kilian Jornet’s course record of 19:49:30. Wiping away tears while receiving congratulations from past UTMB championFrançois D’Haene, it was clear how much this victory meant to him. On his fifth attempt, Jim Walmsley put together all the pieces of UTMB for a win and new course record in the 2023 edition of the event. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Fellow American Miller came across the line in second with a time of 19:58:58, looking completely spent. This was his best finish during what can only be called an extended relationship with UTMB starting in 2016. Granger completed the podium with a 20:10:52. Second-place Zach Miller looks positively spent at the 2023 UTMB finish. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Blanchard, last year’s second-place UTMB finisher, ended just off the podium in fourth. Maybe one of the more impressive results of this years race was of Pommeret in fifth. The 48-year-old masters athlete, who was the 2016 UTMB champion and 2022 TDS winner, showed that age really is just a number. The other surprise in the top 10 has to beTyler Green, the American who made a late race move to finish in seventh. He didn’t move into the top 10 until Tête de Béchar, 161 kilometers in.

2023 CCC Results: Albon and Kaspersen Win Over Deep Fields,"There’s nothing quite like theUTMBMont Blanc festival week, and the 2023CCCis the final lead-up to the big dance. Racers, numbering 2,406 this year, took off from Courmayeur, Italy, on Friday, September 1 at 9:15 a.m. to cover 101 kilometers (63 miles) and approximately 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) of elevation gain. The course, going in the opposite direction from theTDS, which runs earlier in the week, traces a sinuous path through the mountains, paying a visit to Champex-Lac, Switzerland, and finishing at the hub of the week’s festivities, Chamonix, France. Often used as a stepping stone for racers eyeing UTMB in the future, it’s always a competitive race on both the men’s and women’s side, and this year was no exception. Like the other races this week, the CCC was run on a slightly modified course, but the change didn’t affect its distance or vertical gain. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: Jonathan Albon(U.K.) ran away with the top honors at this year’s CCC by executing what appeared to be a measured and well-planned race strategy. Finishing second in the race in 2022, he had the knowledge of what he needed to do to win it. Lurking in the top 10 early in the race, Albon seemed content to bide his time. But when it was time to go, no one was able to stay with him. Albon pulled away from the rest of the field not only by running faster, but by being incredibly efficient in the aid stations. He took on all of his nutrition and liquid while still standing, refusing to sit down and waste any time. Even in a race this long, each second counts. Over the top of the final climb at La Flégère, he was five minutes clear of his next competitor. Known for his descending, Albon never looked back and finished with a time of 10:14:25. Jia-Sheng Shen(China) came closest to matching Albon’s pace to finish second, a significant improvement over his fourth-place finish in the race in 2022. Shen meant business from the get-go and took the race out fast. He led for much of the time until Albon’s unrelenting pace simply became too much. He finished just under 10 minutes back with a time of 10:22:30. Dakota Jones enjoys the finishing straight on his way to finishing third.

Full results. The 2023 CCC men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Jia-Sheng Shen, 1. Jonathan Albon, and 3. Dakota Jones. It was pure dominance fromYngvild Kaspersen(Norway) in the women’s race this year. Finishing 30th last year must have been a learning experience that she put to good use this time around. From early in the race, she held a solid gap on her closest competitors. At Champex-Lac, 53 kilometers into the race, she was already 20 minutes up, and the gap only continued to grow. She finished in 11:51:22, nearly 40 minutes up on the next woman. The 2023 CCC women’s champion, Yngvild Kaspersen, coming down the finishing chute. Emily Hawgood(Zimbabwe, lives in the U.S.) is no stranger to the UTMB Mont Blanc festival events, and her second place here with a time of 12:28:19 showed that she’s only continuing to improve. She finished sixth last year at UTMB and 10th in 2021. She’s also one of the many people who are choosing to double up a UTMB festival event with the Western States 100 earlier in the year. She finished an impressive fifth in that jaunt through the California mountains, a much different environment from the CCC course, showing that she’s a versatile runner who can handle many conditions. The race for the final spot on the podium came down to a battle betweenHelen Mino Faukner(U.S.) andHau Ha Thi(Vietnam). With just the slightest of margins, the American was able to hold on to third with a time of 12:38:05. Thi finished just 23 seconds behind.

2023 OCC Results: McCann and Angermund Run to Victories,"The 2023OCCrace left Orsières, Switzerland, at 8:15 a.m. on Thursday, August 31, and sent 1,729 runners through Champex-Lac, Switzerland, and on to the finish in Chamonix, France. The point-to-point route through Orsières, Champex-Lac, and Chamonix, with the abbreviated race name coming from the town names, is often called the Little Swiss Sister ofUTMB. While the course is a relatively short 55 kilometers (34.2 miles), it’s packed with an impressive 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of elevation gain through the high mountains. With a rockslide closing one of the trails between Trient and Col de Balme, runners took a slightly more direct route than in years past, which together with cool and dry conditions, plus the ever-increasing depth of competition at this event, meant fast times. Last year’s winners,Manuel Merillas(Spain) andSheila Aviles(Spain) did not return to defend their titles, but there were many fast women and men to challenge for the win. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: The depth of the women’s field for the 2023 OCC was impressive, but after 55k, it wasToni McCann(South Africa) who ran into Chamonix solo for the win with a time of 5:18:21. Last year’s OCC fifth-place finisher put together a solid race start to finish and looked absolutely ecstatic, if a little bit shocked, when crossing the finish line with plenty of time to celebrate her win. The South African runner is coming off a string of victories this season already, including the Davos X-Trails and Transvulcania by UTMB 50k. The 2023 OCC women’s champion Toni McCann looks absolutely stunned at her victory. All photos: UTMB All eyes were on the 2022 UTMB champion and 2023 Western States 100 second-place finisher,Katie Schide(U.S.), and she didn’t disappoint at this much shorter distance. An American living in France, Schide has a long history with the UTMB race festival events, including an additional two top-10 UTMB finishes in 2019 and 2021 and a second place at CCC in 2018. In the final kilometers of the race, it was clear that Schide would earn a podium spot, but it was unknown whether she’d be able to hold off a chargingMiao Yao(China). With the gap hovering at 15 to 20 seconds through the final minutes of the race, it seemed possible that Yao, a 2:37 marathoner, would have the leg speed to close the gap on the longer-distance specialist. But in the end, by running the steps and squeezing every last second out of the course, Schide was able to hold on to second with a time of 5:26:25. Yao finished in 5:27:07. Full results. The 2023 OCC women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Katie Schide, 1. Toni McCann, and 3. Miao Yao. Stian Angermund(Norway) was first across the line for the 2023 OCC on a beautiful day in Chamonix with a time of 4:42:40. A blistering fast day on the course saw close times between the top four men in the final kilometers, but it was the Norwegian who was able to hold on to a lead that he established just over halfway through the race. Sitting in third at just under 30k into the day, he made his move on the climb up to the Col de Balme and never looked back. This win is another in a long line for Angermund, who has already run away with victories in the Trail World Championships 50k and the Trail des Hauts Forts 20k this year. Surely this win was sweet redemption after his DNF at CCC in 2021. Stian Angermund (Norway) took over the lead just over halfway and never looked back. The battle for the final podium spots remained close betweenFrancesco Puppi(Italy),Antonio Martínez(Spain), andYou-Sheng Guan(China). Puppi ran a smart race throughout, staying near the front, but was as far back as ninth place at 23k into the race, and was able to put on the gas to slowly but surely move himself into second by the end. With a final time of 4:44:58, he was able to just stay ahead of Martínez, who finished on the final podium spot in 4:45:19. Puppi has already had a successful season with these shorter distances, including wins in the Lavaredo Ultra Trail by UTMB 50k and the Andersen Half Marathon Trail. Full results. [Editor’s Note:On February 10, 2024, Stian Angermund, the 2023 OCC champion, revealed viaInstagramand inan interview with Norwegian media, NRK, that he had received notice on October 20, 2023, from the French Anti-Doping Agency, of a prohibited substance, chlorthalidone, found in his urine in a test following the 2023 OCC. Chlorthalidone, a diuretic, is on the World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List because it can be used to mask the presence of other substances in the body. No public comment has been made by the French Anti-Doping Agency, the outcome is still pending, and we’ll update this story as needed.

2023 TDS Results: Meier and Nakache Win on Rerouted Course,"When it comes to summer trail racing, there’s no greater spectacle than theUTMBMont-Blanc festival of races based out of Chamonix, France. The 2023TDS, an acronym for Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, departed Courmayeur, Italy, just after midnight on Tuesday, August 29, with some 1,650 runners lighting up the mountainous route back to Chamonix. With a late summer storm moving in and bringing the snow line down to under 2,000 meters, organizers rerouted parts of the course to accommodate the bad weather that continued on throughout the event. In the 13 years covering the festival, the iRunFar crew hasn’t seen the snow line come so low from a summer storm. The normally 145-kilometer (90 miles) course was extended to 153 kilometers (95 miles) while still holding on to plenty of climbing, and the extra distance combined with the difficult conditions led to extended finish times. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival: Christian Meier(Canada) started the race relatively conservatively over the first set of mountains and the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard before pushing the pace and starting to pick off the men in front of him. He took over the lead near Le Pas D’Outray, 90 kilometers in, and never looked back, slowly extending his lead over the rest of the field for the remainder of the race. A former professional cyclist, Meier has taken to ultrarunning with great success, winning the Trail Andorra 50k earlier this year. He ran to his TDS victory in 19:36:35. Simen Wästlundof Sweden started out fast, leading the race for the first 90 kilometers, when Meier passed him in the high mountains. He made a valiant effort to stay with the Canadian and ultimately finished just over 20 minutes behind in 19:57:41.

All photos: UTMB Rounding out the top three wasYannick Noël. The Frenchman started conservatively, dropping all the way down to 10th early on in the mountains. From there, he turned on the gas, slowly clawing spots back throughout the rest of the race, finally moving into third around the Col de Very, 112 kilometers in. He finished just a smidge over 20 minutes back from Wästlund in 20:18:02. 1 –Christian Meier(Canada) – 19:36:352 –Simen Wästlund(Sweden) – 19:57:413 –Yannick Noël(France) – 20:18:024 –Jean-Marie Thévenard(France) – 20:29:535 –Cristofer Clemente(Spain) – 20:43:526 –Guillaume Beauxis(France) – 21:02:197 –Nicolas Gourdon(France) – 21:02:228 –André Purschke(Denmark) – 21:16:339 –Paul Lenoir(France) – 21:38:4110 –Jean-Marie Diverrez(France) – 21:44:34 Sage Canadaywas the top American finisher in 12th with a time of 22:06:21. Full results. The 2023 TDS men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Simen Wästlund, 1. Christian Meier, and 3. Yannick Noël. It was a clean sweep of the women’s podium for France, withMaryline Nakache(France) putting on a masterclass on pacing to win the women’s race with an impressive time of 23:37:57, more than 30 minutes ahead of the next woman. Starting further back early on in the mountains, the Frenchwoman bided her time, slowly but surely moving up in the field. By the end, she’d moved past every single other woman to finish the race in impressive fashion. Nakache is no stranger to success, winning the Marathon des Sables earlier in the year, as well as taking second at the 2023 Lavaredo Ultra Trail. Fiona Porte(France) also ran a strong and steady race to finish second in 24:08:32. Porte came off an already impressive summer season with wins at the 2023 Lavaredo Ultra Trail, beating fellow Frenchwoman Nakache, and the MaXi-Race du lac d’Annecy 80k. The 2023 TDS winner Maryline Nakache (right) greets second-place woman Fiona Porte. The final Frenchwoman on the podium wasFlavie Bruyneelwith a time of 24:26:14. She also executed an exceptional race in terms of pacing, sitting well back in the group during the early kilometers in the race and steadily moving up, passing many as the distance went on. 1 –Maryline Nakache(France) – 23:37:572 –Fiona Porte(France) – 24:08:323 –Flavie Bruyneel(France) – 24:26:144 –Paulina Krawczak(Poland) – 24:51:175 –Magali Mellon(France) – 25:12:476 –Emeline Oudet(France) – 25:26:017 –Ingrid Lid(The Netherlands) – 26:22:238 –Maria Fernanda Monje(Colombia) – 27:20:379 –Christine Selman(U.S.) – 28:22:2610 –Justine Rouveyrol(France) – 28:17:25 Full results.

2023 Hardrock 100 Results: Dauwalter Nails Double and French Dominate,"The 2023Hardrock 100set off at 6 a.m. on Friday, July 14 in Silverton, Colorado, the small mountain town sitting in the early morning shadow of the mighty San Juan Mountains. Faced with 102.5 miles and more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain, runners set out to traverse the massive and rugged counterclockwise loop — the event changes direction each year — around one of Colorado’s most impressive mountain ranges, heading first toward Lake City, then on to Ouray and Telluride, before returning to Silverton for the finish. In the end, it wasAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of France to make it back to Silverton to kiss the rock first with a time of 23:00:07. He took the race lead from the start and never looked back. For the women, it was another dominant performance fromCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), where she not only set a counterclockwise course record with a time of 26:14:12, but also an overall women’s record and a Western States 100-Hardrock 100 double record with a combined time of 41:43:42 — but more on all that in a bit. But this edition of the Hardrock 100 wasn’t easy for anyone. After a big winter in the San Juan Mountains, there was snow. And a lot of it. Large snowfields flanked Virginius Pass/Kroger’s Canteen and Grant-Swamp Pass, and snowmelt made much of the course muckier than normal. It wasn’t just the snow that would provide environmental challenges beyond the normal obstacles found in the San Juans. The heat that was also unusual. With barely a cloud in the sky for the entire race and no chance of rain, temperatures soared in the 80s Fahrenheit at the course’s lower elevations and caused many runners a significant amount of distress. Courtney Dauwalter set a new women’s course record and placed fourth overall at the 2023 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Pre-race, the men’s race seemed to be wide open with none of the top-four men of 2022 returning. Instead, a handful of men, some with Hardrock experience and even more without it, lined up to vie for the win. It’s probably fair to say that several men had ambitions for the win, and few were willing to pick a clear frontrunner. On the other hand, it seemed like very few were willing to bet against Dauwalter for the win. Fresh off of hercourse record at the 2023 Western States 100just three weeks prior, the 2022 Hardrock 100 champion and record holder showed up to Silverton appearing recovered and ready. Still, running two 100-mile races in a three-week span provides a lot of miles for something to go wrong, and there were a handful of women ready to take advantage of a potentially tired Dauwalter. A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Hardrock 100 possible! Thanks also toLEKIfor its support of our Hardrock coverage. Without any clear race favorite this year, the men’s race was wide open, and France’sAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) made the most of the opportunity to go to the front immediately, leading the race line-to-line. Even before the first mile was up, Dunand-Pallaz had opened up a gap on the rest of the field and never looked back, running steady and strong through the heat of the day and the dark of the night. Behind Dunand-Pallaz, the race between the rest of the field never let up, but the gap to the leader continued to grow steadily as the hours passed. Silverton localAvery Collins(pre-race interview)led the early chase, along withDylan Bowman(pre-race interview), who had finished second here in 2021. While Dunand-Pallaz was running his first Hardrock 100, Bowman had course experience on his side, and Collins had the course in his backyard to train on. Aurélien Dunand-Pallaz led the 2023 Hardrock 100 wire to wire.

Benat Marmissolle climbs in the San Juan mountains early in the 2023 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Coming through the Maggie aid station at mile 15.5, it seemed like Dunand-Pallaz was going to give the men’s record a run for its money, coming in about 10 minutes under course-record pace. By this time, he was also 10 minutes up on Collins, who was running in second. While Dunand-Pallaz’s gap on the course record had disappeared by the time he dropped into the Sherman aid station at mile 30, his gap on the rest of the field had grown to 13 minutes, now with Marmissolle running in second with Bowman and Collins just a couple of minutes back. The rest of the top 10 remained unchanged. Jeff Browning changes shoes in Telluride, mile 74.5, before heading out for his seventh Hardrock 100 finish in 2023. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi And aside from a few shuffles within the field, not a whole lot changed in the top 10 until the witching hours, after the heat of the day turned to the dark of night and legs started to get heavy. Then things started to change, and quickly. While the two Frenchmen continued their relentless march forward, both Collins and Bowman faltered, and it was Dominguez who left the Chapman aid station at mile 84 in third. Glick was fourth, Terranova fifth, and Browning sixth. Both Collins and Bowman took extended stops at Chapman to regroup, losing their positions but eventually headed back out on the trail to finish. Aurélien Dunand-Pallaz finished his first Hardrock 100 in first place with the eighth-fastest time ever. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks While others struggled behind him, Dunand-Pallaz crested the last climb well clear of the field. Marmissolle followed 40 minutes back. And from there, it was almost all downhill for the two Frenchmen. Dunand-Pallaz ran back into Silverton to kiss the rock and win his first Hardrock 100 in 23:00:07, the eighth-fastest time in history. Marmissolle finished second and was followed by Dominguez who ran a steady and smart race from start to end finished third in 26:12:01. Glick finished fourth with a time of  26:43:05, and Browning would round out the top five with a time of 27:17:02.

Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Brady If it wasn’t forCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) running the Western States 100 just three weeks prior, crushing the women’s record there, and potentially being a bit worn out at the start line of the Hardrock 100, it would have been hard to find someone to bet against her winning the race this year. But if she were to falter, there were several women who were ready to jump at the opportunity. Anne-Lise Rousset climbs happy during the early miles of the 2023 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi For the first part of the race, it seemed like France’sAnne-Lise Rousset Séguret(post-race interview) was going to do just that. While Dauwalter led in the very early miles of the course, Rousset opened up a sizable gap coming through Maggie Gulch at mile 15.5 and was moving with enthusiasm toward Pole Creek, the next aid station. She came into Sherman at mile 30 in seventh overall in 6:29, looking strong. Dauwalter was just six minutes behind, andAnnie Hughes(pre-raceandpost-raceinterview) came in next, 52 minutes off the lead. With still many miles to run, it was still anyone’s race. FrenchwomanClaire Bannwarth(pre-race interview) came through just seven minutes later and was followed by Japan’sKimino Miyazaki(pre-race interview), who was 1:22 off the lead but looking spry and happy. The top-two women came back together through Grizzly Gulch at mile 36 with Hughes trailing them at just under an hour back. When Rousset led Dauwalter into Grouse Gulch, mile 43.5, by nearly 10 minutes after traversing Handies Peak, the course high point, it seemed like maybe the Western States 100-Hardrock 100 double was going to be too much for Dauwalter to handle. Claire Bannwarth (left) and Annie Hughes share early miles in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi But it’s never a good idea to bet against the most dominant female trail ultrarunner of this generation. By mile 50, she’d closed the gap to four minutes, and in Ouray at mile 58.5, it was down to two minutes. When it came to the climb out of Ouray, Dauwalter made her move, and the elastic to Rousset finally snapped over the top of Virginius Pass. Dauwalter never looked back. Meanwhile, Hughes stayed steady in third place while dealing with stomach issues and the rest of the women’s pack, including Miyazaki, Bannwarth,Christina Bauer,Whitney Mickelsen,Darla Askew,Becky Bates, and last-minute waitlist entrantEmily Halnon, who only got into the race the morning before, continued to chase — all within close proximity to each other. An enthusiastic Darla Askew runs in Cunningham Gulch, mile 9, early in the 2023 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Brady Dauwalter ran into Telluride at mile 74.5, her pace still hovering just a few minutes over course-record pace, but now 23 minutes ahead of second-place Rousset, and executed the fasted crew stop of the Telluride aid station, getting in and out in under three minutes. She was on a mission. Annie Hughes struggled with calories the entire race but still held on for third in her debut Hardrock 100 in 2023. Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Brady Just 10 miles later, she was well below course-record pace, crushing the Bear Creek Trail climb out of Telluride and moving herself into third overall as some of the lead men began to falter. Rousset also continued her relentless march, and while she was 48 minutes back on Dauwalter at mile 84, she was only three minutes up on course-record pace. In the end, there was no catching Dauwalter as she ran back to Silverton to kiss the rock with a new women’s counterclockwise course record of 26:14:12, besting the one set by the legendaryDiana Finkelin 2009, and finishing fourth overall. She also set a new overall women’s record, beating her old time of 26:44:36, which she set last year. Courtney Dauwalter runs downhill into Grouse Gulch at mile 43.5 of the 2023 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Not only that, she set a new overall record for the Western States 100-Hardrock 100 double with a combined time of 41:43:42, beating Jeff Browning’s old record of 42:12:43 that he set in 2016. Rousset would finish second after a gutsy run with a time of 27:29:55, which registers as the fifth-fastest time in event history, and Hughes would hold onto third with a time of 32:13:03 after spending nearly 100 miles battling stomach and breathing issues. Anne-Lise Rousset finishes her first Hardrock 100 in second place after leading many of the early miles. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks With large gaps between the first, second, and third women, all eyes turned to the competition between fourth and 10th where the time gaps were tight and the women were often in the aid stations together in the back half of the race. Miyazaki and Bannwarth ran in close proximity to each other battling for fourth and fifth, while Mickelsen, Halnon, Bates, Askew, and Bauer seemed to maintain the same overall pace as the miles ticked by.

2023 Western States 100 Results: Dauwalter Sets Course Record and Evans Executes for the Win,"At 5:00 a.m. on June 24, 379 runners started the 2023Western States 100. And what a day those dreamers and doers had. Climbing from the Palisades Tahoe ski area in Olympic Valley, California, to meet the sunrise, the runners chased the historic 100.2-mile course through its 18,000 feet of elevation gain and 22,000 feet of loss. The course was made more wild by the past year’s weather, but the day otherwise benefited from favorable temperatures. Incredible snowfall and the late 2022 Mosquito Fire impacted course conditions. The first 15 miles were impacted by snow, and then runners faced a newly unshaded 16-mile stretch due to the fire damage. But race-day temperatures were well off the common 100-degree-Fahrenheit highs of past years. It was the race’s fourth-coolest day in history. Courtney Dauwalter setting a new course record at the 2023 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Women’s winnerCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) shattered the longstanding course record. Dauwalter’s 15:29 finish was incredibly 78 minutes better thanEllie Greenwood’s2012 former course best. Favorable weather likely also contributed to the most sub-18-hour women’s finishes (9) in the race’s history. Men’s winnerTom Evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) from the U.K. broke free after Foresthill, mile 62, and finished in 14:40. It was the race’s fourth-fastest ever and made him a 24-minute winner. Read on for more details on how the race unfolded. A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible! None of the first four women from last year’s race —Ruth Croft,Ailsa MacDonald,Marianne Hogan,Luzia Buehler— returned. That made Zimbabwe’sEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview) the highest returning finisher from 2022. Hawgood’s pretty much a race local now too, living in nearby Roseville, California. But it was 38-year-oldCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) that came into the race as a favorite. She won here in 2018 in 17:27 and was looking to avenge a late drop at the 2019 race. Dauwalter was first up the Escarpment. At 2,500 feet, it’s the race’s biggest climb and it happens right away in the first three miles. But 2022 UTMB winnerKatie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was right there too. Schide, an American who’s lived in France for the past seven years, hit the top in 46 minutes with Dauwalter and the two dropped into the Granite Chief Wilderness together. Already Dauwalter and Schide, age 31, had a three-minute lead on third-placeIda Nilsson(pre-race interview) from Sweden. Ida Nilsson later resupplying in Dusty Corners. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks By mile 11, Lyon Ridge, Dauwalter and Schide’s lead on third-place Nilsson had ballooned to eight minutes. And then it got even bigger as the two completely broke away from everyone else. At mile 16, Red Star Ridge, no one was within 14 minutes of the front two. Nilsson, Hawgood, 2023 Black Canyon 100k winnerKeely Henninger(pre-race interview),Taylor Nowlin, professional triathlete-turned-ultrarunnerHeather Jackson, Canada’sPriscilla ForgieandJenny Quilty, and 2022 sixth-place finisherLeah Yingling(pre-race interview) all ran inside the early top 10. The Mosquito Fire limited crew access this year and everyone met their crews for the first time at mile 30, Robinson Flat. Dauwalter was in at 5:07 and out within a minute, and still on her 2019 splits. Schide took a longer break and changed shoes, exiting the aid station three minutes behind the leader. The two had completely broken open the women’s race. Nilsson, in her 100-mile debut, had been alone in third to this point, but was now joined by Henninger, Hawgood, and Nowlin. Courtney Dauwalter rolling into the Duncan Canyon aid station early in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks At mile 34, Miller’s Defeat, the course record watch started. Dauwalter and Schide were under Dauwalter’s own 2019 splits andEllie Greenwood’s2012 course record pace. Dauwalter was five minutes up on Greenwood’s splits, and Schide was three minutes faster. Even more, the two were over 30 minutes in front of third-place Hawgood at mile 38. Dauwalter and Schide were out front for the win and the course record, and the other contenders grouped behind them. Dauwalter was red hot up the Devil’s Thumb climb at mile 48, but Schide hadn’t given up much time. She took longer in aid and left six minutes after Dauwalter. Hawgood, Nowlin, and Henninger came in together next, now 40 minutes behind second-place Schide. At Foresthill, Dauwalter was 25 minutes up on record pace. Schide conceded only another two minutes over the last stretch and was 11 minutes behind Dauwalter. While Dauwalter and Schide were still off the front, the race dynamic was heating up behind. The third- through eighth-place women were all in Foresthill together with only three minutes separation. Hawgood was there first among the chase group, but Hungarian living in Hong KongEszter Csillag(post-race interview) quickly jumped from eighth at mile 52 to fourth at mile 62. Nilsson was fifth, and Henninger,Katie Asmuth, and Nowlin were all there too. Katie Asmuth on the climb Michigan Bluff. Photo: iRunFar/Jaja Ferrer Capili Dauwalter ran 2:10 from mile 62 Foresthill to mile 78 at the American River. Only the men’s winner would run a quicker split on this day, and only eight men have ever run a faster split in the race — this was per the race organization’s livestream, which was citing Liam/@aidstationfireb on Twitter. Dauwalter was five levels better than everyone else, and she was boldly racing without a pacer too. Schide stayed comfortably in second, but fell further behind Dauwalter’s quickening pace and river conditions necessitated that everyone cross the American River in a boat this year. From Foresthill to the river, Katie Asmuth vaulted into third, past Eszter Csillag and Ida Nilsson. Asmuth was seventh at Foresthill and picked up four spots on the downhill Cal Street stretch, outrunning common expectations in coming back from injury. All three women split faster from Foresthill to the river than Schide did and even if the front two were gone, the women in general were running really fast. There’s bound to be some bad luck in a 100 miler though, and Henninger fell just before the river and dislocated her shoulder. She would then drop from the race at mile 80, Green Gate, due to that injury. Dauwalter’s incredible second half and incredible race brought her to the Placer High School track finish in 15:29. Dauwalter completely shattered the record books and set a new standard that is likely to last for a lifetime. Ellie Greenwood’s 16:47 course record had stood since 2012. Dauwalter will next race the high altitude 2023 Hardrock 100 in Silverton, Colorado, on July 14. Dauwalter is the Hardrock course record holder, too, but Western States plus Hardrock will certainly be a challenging double. Schide challenged Dauwalter early, and outpaced the rest of the women’s field in doing so. Schide was in second for much of the day, ultimately finishing as runner up in 16:43. That was also under the old course record. Katie Schide taking second at the 2023 Western States 100, under the existing course record time. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Csillag, who wasfifth at the 2022 UTMB, had a remarkable second half to finish third in 17:09. It is the race’s fourth-fastest run ever. And she just edged out Asmuth, who moved up from last year’s ninth-place run to finish fourth in 17:21. Asmuth’s time was just inside of Ruth Croft’s winning time from last year, and is the race’s fifth-fastest ever. Hawgood earned a second straight fifth-place finish. In 2022 she was able to finish fifth in 18:16 and in this year’s faster race Hawgood was fifth in 17:26. That time ranks eighth-best ever and is just faster than what Dauwalter ran to win in 2018. Taylor Nowlin improved her finish place by one from prior year, but like Hawgood greatly improved her finish time. Nowlin was sixth in 17:40. One-hundred-mile debutante Ida Nilsson was seventh in 17:43, and Priscilla Forgie was just minutes back in eighth at 17:46. Leah Yingling was a repeat top-10 finisher in ninth at 17:49. For perspective, no year had seen more than three women finish under 18 hours before. But this year nine women finished under 18 hours. It is the new standard for women’s racing at Western States. The 25-year-oldMeghan Morgantook the prized 10th-place finish in 18:11, thereby guaranteeing a chance to automatically return next year.

Despite snow, Zhao hit the top in 42 minutes. Slower to the top, FrenchmanMathieu Blanchard(pre-race interview) and BritTom Evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) turned to greet the brilliant sunrise together. Zhao won the Ultra-Trail Mt. Fuji 100 Mile in April 2023 and is a two-time winner of the Doi Inthanon by UTMB 100 Mile in Thailand. He pushed his early lead to five minutes at Lyon Ridge, mile 11, while 2022 fourth-placerTyler Green(post-race interview) led the early chase group.Green had finished as high as second here before, in 2021, but was running more aggressively toward the front earlier than ever before. Tyler Green opening up his stride later in the race coming into Foresthill. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks From mile-15 Red Star Ridge to mile-25 Duncan Canyon, the chase group started to make up time on Zhao. Tom Evans, Chinese runnerJia-Sheng Shen, andDakota Jones(pre-race interview) were among a group that cut four minutes from Zhao’s lead over just nine miles.Evans was third here in 2019 in 14:59, and Jones had just biked 680 miles from his home in Utah to the race start. Zhao was quickly swallowed up in the next five miles to Robinson Flat, mile 30, and soon fell out of the top 10. A lead trio of Tom Evans, Dakota Jones, and Jia-Sheng Shen came into aid at 4:45, meeting their crews for the first time. At mile 30 and with Zhao falling backward,Anthony Costales(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was fourth, and then he was with Tyler Green at mile 38 in fourth and fifth. The two would barely separate the rest of the race. Anthony Costales later racing up to Michigan Bluff. Photo: iRunFar/Jaja Ferrer Capili Evans and Jones dropped Shen on the climb to Devil’s Thumb, mile 48, and the two leaders came into aid together in 7:03. Four minutes back Costales had caught Shen on the big climb, and Tyler Green,Jeff Colt, New Zealand’sDaniel Jones,Ryan Montgomery, Mathieu Blanchard, and 47-year-oldLudovic Pommeretwere inside the top 10. Those six were 14 minutes apart. 2022 third- and second-place finishersArlen Glick(pre-race interview) andHayden Hawks(pre-race interview) were back in 11th and 16th, respectively. After earlier moving up, Hawks had just lost several places and would later drop with injury at mile 55. Other top-10 finishers from 2022Cody Lind,Scott Traer, andAlex Nicholswere all noticeably outside the top 10 too. As the race shifted to its mile-62 Foresthill hub, Evans gained some separation on Jones and entered the aid station first, but as Evans changed shoes and socks, Jones didn’t wait and exited first. Jones was now in the lead by himself for the first time and he was overheard voicing his intention to break Evans. Some 11 minutes back of those two leaders, Green and Costales were again together and in third and fourth. Shen and Jeff Colt were just minutes back of those two, and Colt was remarkably almost an hour faster than a year ago when he finished 11th. Tom Evans and Dakota Jones locked in a duel climbing to Michigan Bluff. Photo: iRunFar/Jaja Ferrer Capili Jones and Evans separated leaving Foresthill and anticipation ran high for their next steps. The two had been together for nearly the entirety of the race to this point. Jones wanted to make a move and Evans wanted to keep up with (the) Jones. The duel ended quickly and dramatically though. Tom Evans dropped hard down Cal Street, hitting what he said at the finish was a 5:54 minute/mile, and hit Cal 2, mile 71, in 10:12. That surge pushed Jones eight minutes back at mile 71. It was just nine miles from Foresthill to that split on Cal Street, but the front two had shattered and moved in opposite directions the rest of the race. Evans ran alone to the river crossing at mile 78, and ultimately to the finish. Tyler Green, Anthony Costales, Jeff Colt, and Jia-Sheng Shen all overtook Dakota Jones on the way to the river too. Forget about Elm Street, Jones was having a bit of a nightmare on Cal Street. Evans, the 2022 UTMB third placer, continued to put time on the field the rest of the way. He finished in 14:40 and that’s the race’s fourth fastest finish ever. The mark trails onlyJim WalmsleyandJared Hazenin 2019, and Walmsley’s 2018 mark too. Evans was a runaway winner, but the rest of the top 10 was much more closely packed. Tom Evans winning the 2023 Western States 100 in 14:40. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Tyler Green pushed on in second, and held off an Anthony Costales chase over the last 15 miles. Green finished in 15:04. It was his second runner-up finish and a big personal best for the course. He was able to finish with his baby boy on his shoulders. Green’s 15:04 was the race’s 11th-fastest finish ever. Costales was third in 15:09, the race’s 13th-fastest finish ever. Jia-Sheng Shen and Daniel Jones both finished fast. Shen clocked 15:19 and Jones was fifth in 15:22. Mathieu Blanchard and Ryan Montgomery both overtook Jeff Colt late. Those three — Blanchard, Montgomery, and Colt — finished in 15:37, 15:38, and 15:42, respectively. Local runnerCole Watsonbettered his 2022 14th-place finish with a ninth-place 15:54. In 2019 the top 10 all went under 16 hours. This year’s 10th-place manJanosch Kowalczykfrom Germany just missed matching that feat. He finished in 16:09. Seven of last year’s top 10 returned, but only Tyler Green was able to again make the top 10. The 2022 top 10 finishers Ludovic Pommeret, Arlen Glick, Scott Traer, Cody Lind, and Alex Nichols finished 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th, and 28th this year, respectively. As earlier mentioned, 2022 runner-up Hayden Hawks dropped. After running near or in the lead through Foresthill, Dakota Jones finished 17th in 17:00.

2023 World Mountain Running Championships Up and Down Results: U.S.’s Murphy and Uganda’s Chemutai Win Big in Innsbruck,"Call it the 2023World Mountain Running Championships Up and Downrace or call it the Classic race, but the two lapper closed out the 2023World Mountain and Trail Running Championshipson June 10, and what a four-day stretch it was! The men started at 12:30 p.m. local time and the women’s race ran 90 minutes later, both on a 15-kilometer course that gained 751 meters of elevation. That’s 9.3 miles and 2,463 feet. The race started in town and certainly featured more road terrain than many expected, including a section of trail created over top of road. In fact, nearly 3.6k of each lap was on the road. Grayson Murphy, 2023 World Mountain Running Championships Up and Down race winner. Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Brady As in all of the races here, there was a €16,500 prize purse that gave €4,000 to the winner with money stretching five deep. Podium finishers earned a ceremonial pine tree too, reflective of the organization’s efforts for sustainability. iRunFar earlier covered the 2023World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race, 2023Trail World Championships 40k, and 2023Trail World Championships 80k.

Tove Alexanderssonfrom Sweden started slower but ran downhill into second just less than 20 minutes into the race, and then overtook Murphy two minutes later. Alexandersson led Murphy by 11 seconds at halfway, but Murphy wasn’t done. Grayson Murphy navigating the “city trail” section of the 2023 World Mountain Running Championships Up and Down race.

Murphy was faster on the ups, and Alexandersson on the downs, it first appeared, but Murphy completely broke her chaser. It wasn’t close the rest of the way. Grayson Murphy was way ahead at the finish with 64:29 on the clock. Alexandersson was second in 65:26. In addition to the 2023 Uphill bronze medal, Murphy won the 2019 World Mountain Running Championships too. Alexandersson, age 30, is a world leader in orienteering and ski orienteering.

Women’s Teams [Editor’s Note:Christel Dewalle previously served a four-month doping ban after a positive test for the stimulant Heptaminol at the 2016 Skyrunning World Championships.] What a crazy race. A number of lead changes and an early celebration, combined with the mixed terrain of the course, added to the excitement. Liam Meirowof the U.S. towered over a shorterIsaac Kibetfrom Uganda right after the start, and as soon as they left town and moved to the trail it was Kibet in the lead. He stayed there for eight minutes until Kenya’sPhilemon Kiriagopassed, and then Germany’sFilimon Abrahamdid a short while later too. A bunch of others soon skipped in front too as the race got going in earnest. All of the top runners were racing in road shoes, reflective of the limited rock and root on the course.

Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Brady Just before halfway Uganda’sEliudCherop, fifth at last year’s race, joined Kiriago and Abraham in a three-person lead group, and then Cherop broke free from the group. He led under the halfway arch in 26 minutes and mistakenly had a moment of muted celebration and finish line confusion after the first of two laps. That let Kiriago and Abraham regain Cherop when the climbing resumed, and Kiriago and Abraham traded positions through the next section. Kiriago dropped Abraham and started to stretch the lead some 35 minutes into the race, but UgandanLeonard Chemutaiwas surging behind. Chemutai, like Kiriago at only 20 years old, first collected Abraham and 48 minutes into the race passed Kiriago for the ultimate lead.

Chemutai finished in 56:14 for gold. Kiriago was second in 56:22, and Abraham won individual bronze in 56:27. The three each waved flags through the finish chute. Chemutai remarkably won the junior race at last year in Thailand. He did not race the earlier Uphill race, but Kiriago was seventh three days earlier.

2023 Trail World Championships 80k Results: Victories All Around for France,"After last year’s event in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the 2023Trail World Championships 80k, now part of the combinedWorld Mountain and Trail Running Championships, returned to Europe and the Tyrolean Alps, with the event jointly hosted by the village of Neustift im Stubaital and the city of Innsbruck, Austria. With too much snow on the original course, organizers made a last-minute change to an alternate course that routed the middle part of the course over lower mountains between the start in Neustift in the Stubai Valley and the finish in Innsbruck. The change didn’t seem to affect the character of the course or reduce its difficulty. Deemed one of the most, if not the most, technical course that the Trail World Championships has dished up, times were relatively slow for the 80-kilometer (actually 87k/54 miles) course which had 6,500 meters (21,000 feet) of climbing and even more descending over trails that were slower than many others normally used in European ultramarathon races. The start of the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks On the men’s side, the event had nine out of the top-10 men from last year’s Trail World Championships 80k returning, with only the defending champion missing from the lineup. This means that last year’s second- and third-place men in France’sNicolas Martin(pre-race interview) and Italy’sAndreas Reiterer(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) were returning just seven months after their podium finishes. After several big results in 2021 and 2022, Germany’sHannes Namberger(pre-race interview) came in as one to watch. The women similarly returned two top runners from last year’s Trail World Championships 80k, includingreigning world championBlandine L’Hirondelof France (pre-race interview) andGemma Arenasof Spain, who was third in 2022 and would be running her sixth Trail World Championships. But, as racing tends to go, nothing turned out as expected. In the end, it wasBenjamin Roubiol(post-race interview) andMarion Delespierre(post-race interview), both of France, reaching the Innsbruck finish line first after a day of close racing and frequent lead changes. Roubiol waited until the final climb to put the pressure on a tiring Reiterer, who’d spent much of the race in the lead. The women’s race was equally close with the top-three women coming into the base of the final climb at 66k within two minutes of each other. After racing a very patient and smart race, Delespierre had enough in the tank to pull away fromKatharina Hartmuth(post-race interview) of Germany andManon Bohard Cailler(post-race interview) of France on the final climb and descent. There were no surprises in the winners of the team competition, with France walking away with both the men’s and women’s titles, although the U.S. men made it a close call!

The scenery of Stubai Valley, Austria, where the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k began. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Starting under cool and clear skies in Neustift, the men’s race went out fast up the “starting loop,” which happened to feature a 1,200-meter (4,000 feet) climb over 8.2 kilometers straight out of the starting gate. While things hadn’t split up significantly over the first climb, bothZach Miller(pre-race interview) of the U.S. andAndreas Reiterer(pre-race interview) of Italy came across the top in the top 10, clearly stating their intents for the day. Back down in the valley, the two chasedBaptiste Chassagneof France as the top three, as the race left the Stubai Valley and headed back up into the mountains toward Innsbruck.Benjamin Roubiolof France,Peter Fraňoof Slovakia,Aritz Egeaof Spain, andThibaut Garrivierof France all ran comfortably in the top 10, though Garrivier looked noticeably distressed compared to the others. Pre-race favorite,Nicolas Martin(pre-race interview) of France, was not in contention and would eventually drop after the halfway point due to knee pain. The U.S.’s Zach Miller runs calmly in the early kilometers of the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. He’d go on to take sixth place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks By the 36k mark, Reiterer had taken over the lead from Chassagne as they went over the biggest climb of the day, tallied at 1,400 meters (4,600 feet). From an outside observer’s perspective, Reiterer looked incredibly comfortable, running well within himself and appearing to have everything under control. Egea, Miller, Roubiol, Garrivier, and Fraňo all stayed in the top 10, all within 10 minutes of each other, biding their time. Over the course of the next three major climbs, all around 600 meters (2,000 feet), high in the mountains between the two host cities, Reiterer continued to lead the slowly stretching field. The steep trails were no barrier to his steady effort and the race’s cameraman was seen breathing harder than he was. Roubiol followed about six minutes back over the top of the last climb in the series, with Fraňo, Egea, and Garrivier completing the top five, still within 10 minutes of each other. Miller continued to hold on in sixth. Andreas Reiterer of Italy running at 24 kilometers into the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. He took second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell More than halfway now, the runners bombed down into the village of Grinzens in the valley at 54k, now back to their original starting elevation, except on the other side of the mountains, with more descending to go before the final climb and descent into Innsbruck. Reiterer and Roubiol maintained their top-two positions while the rest of the top 10 continued to shuffle amongst themselves with Garrivier continuing to move up in the field and Miller dropping another place into seventh. Miller, looking spry and claiming that he still had legs, continued to keep tabs on the men in front of him, clearly intent on reeling them in. Continuing down to the low point of the course in Kranebritten at 66k, the top five looked like Reiterer, Roubiol, Fraňo, Garrivier, andTomáš Fárníkof the Czech Republic. Now, all that stood between the front end of the race and the finish was a final 1,000-meter (3,400 feet) climb and a wild drop back down into Innsbruck. While anything could happen, with more than a four-minute lead, it seemed like it was Reiterer’s lead to lose. France’s Benjamin Roubiol climbing at 41 kilometers into the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. He would go on to win the race. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks But on the final climb of the race, the ever-patient Roubiol made his move, surging into the lead at Aspachhütte at 71k, and opening a four-minute gap on a fading Reiterer. Roubiol looked incredibly focused as he made his way up the mountain. Fraňo and Garrivier remained solid in third and fourth, and Miller started to make good on his promise of still having legs, moving into fifth. The gap between Roubiol and Reiterer only continued to grow, eight minutes at 73k, and nine minutes at 75k, as they made their way to the top of the final climb. Fraňo stayed strong in third, Garrivier in fourth, and Miller and Fárník continued to battle for fifth, 25 minutes off the lead.

Reiterer followed just under eight minutes back, the gap holding steady the whole descent. Fraňo and Garrivier both held onto their places to finish third and fourth. Behind them, U.S. teammatesDrew HolmenandEric LiPumamade a strong push to catch up to their teammate Miller. Holmen would out sprint Miller at the line, and the two were followed less a minute later by LiPuma, the trio taking fifth through seventh. For the team competition, Chassagne would be the third French finisher in 17th place, securing the team victory for France. The strong fifth through seventh finishes of the U.S. men slotted them into second in the team competition, just over five minutes behind the French in over 30 hours of cumulative racing. Reiterer would lead the Italian team to a third-place finish. Thibaut Garrivier of France took fourth at the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k, but it was a challenge for him all day.

The rest of the field charged on, led up the first climb byMarcela Vašínová(pre-race interview) of the Czech Republic,Martina Valmassoi(pre-race interview) of Italy, andAkiyama Honokaof Japan. The top five, made up ofAllison Bacaof the U.S., Vašínová,Azara Garcíaof Spain, Valmassoi, and Honoka, all came back through the village of Neustift at 18k and headed out into the mountains toward Innsbruck within two and a half minutes of each other.

Vašínová continued to lead with a smile, opening up a sizable gap to Germany’sKatharina Hartmuthand Valmassoi, who were running within a minute of each other 36k into the race.

By the top of the final 600-meter (2,000 feet) climb in the middle section of the course, the two women had dropped back in the standings with Hartmuth taking over the lead with a five-minute gap over second-placeManon Bohard Caillerof France. Buchauer andMarion Delespierreof France trailed second by less than half a minute now, 49k into the race and only one major climb left to go.

She was clearly enjoying her day out in the mountains, but the descent seemed to take its toll. Bohard Cailler and Delespierre, who’d been chasing together after dropping Buchauer, finally closed the gap to the leader into the final drop to the town of Kranebritten at 66k. Now, with the top-three women within two minutes of each other with one massive climb to go, it was anyone’s race and all three started up the final incline focused and silent.

The gap stayed steady over the top of the climb at 75k, with Hartmuth fighting hard to catch the leader on the final downhill run in to the finish. Bohard Cailler was a further six minutes behind at the top. From there, the gap opened significantly to Buchauer and Valmassoi. The top-two women looked to be moving incredibly strongly on the final descent, but the distance to close the gap was rapidly running out for anyone giving chase. In the end, no one could touch a flying Marion Delespierre who would cross the finish line in first to win the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. Hartmuth and Bohard Cailler held onto their respective positions about seven and 12 minutes back, and an elated Valmassoi finished fourth.

Day two of racing at the 2023World Mountain and Trail Running Championshipsstarted at 9:00 a.m. local time on Thursday, June 8, in downtown Innsbruck, Austria. The women and men shared a common start, and 45 kilometers and 3,194 meters — that’s 28 miles and 10,479 feet — later the group finished in the Stubai Valley. The course was a challenging net-uphill route, temperatures in Innsbruck stretched up to 23 degrees Celsius and 74 degrees Fahrenheit, and weather moved in and out around the course. In the end, due to adverse weather, the race was halted at around the 35k mark, with the final 50 or so runners unable to continue. As in all of the races here, there was a €16,500 prize purse that gave €4,000 to the winner with money stretching five deep.

He trailed Angermund for much of the day, and as with the women’s race, was just over two minutes back of the race winner. Roach, a 42-year-old who lives in Innsbruck, Austria, finished in 4:21. He was eighth at the Zegama Marathon in May. It was Angermund and Roach in front for nearly the entirety of the race, in that order, but unlike in the women’s race, the chase pack wasn’t far behind here.

2023 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill Results: Kenya’s Kipngeno and Austria’s Mayr Win Gold,"Welcome to Innsbruck! The city of 130,000 in western Austria, and the mountains of the Stubai Valley to the southwest of the city, just kicked off the second-ever combinedWorld Mountain and Trail Running Championships. The 2023 festivities opened on Wednesday, June 7, with the 2023World Mountain Running Championships Uphillrace and Kenya’sPatrick Kipngenoand Austria’sAndrea Mayrearned the event’s first individual golds. Kipngeno finished in 40:18, a repeat win from last year, and Mayr topped out in 48:14. It was incredibly Mayr’s seventh world championship win. The course gained 1,020 meters over 7.1 kilometers and finished way up high at the Elfer Hut above the Stubai Valley. Alternately, that’s 3,346 feet across 4.4 miles.

That’s because only three minutes into the race a fence gate bottlenecked runners further back. And then less than 10 minutes into the race, slower runners were already grabbing a few power-hike steps on the steeper terrain.

Kipngeno’s 40:18 finish was 93 seconds better than everyone else. He was exactly that far ahead last year too. Kipngeno will double back for Saturday’s World Mountain Running Championships Up and Down race. Levi Kiprotich was second in 41:51, perhaps giving up some time to his chasers late. Kenya’sJosphat Kiprotichand Uganda’sEliud Cheropwere third and fourth in 42:04 and 42:16, respectively. Joseph Gray stayed in fifth in 42:32. Each country’s first three runners scored in the team competition, and scored via finish position (not by time), and with three runners inside the top seven, Kenya totaled only 11 points to win team gold. Uganda placed second with 21 points, and Switzerland was a surprise third.

That same 900-meter rolling road section meant another sprint start with Kenyan and Uganda runners at the lead, andAllie McLaughlin, last year’s World Mountain Running Championships Uphill Champion, leapt into the early lead a few minutes in too, and only after clipping that problematic fence gate. Fifteen minutes into the race though things were different and Austria’sAndrea Mayrmoved into the lead and quickly opened a minute-plus gap.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Kenya’sPhilaries Kisang, last year’s Thyon-Dixence race winner in Switzerland, spied Mayr from a distance, and when the grade eased a little, Kisang quickly made up time on Mayr. As the two moved above tree-line, Kisang improbably regained the lead and put a few steps on Mayr. The excitement was short lived as Mayr moved back past Kisang and mercied her into hiking. Mayr clutched the host country flag as she finished, and the added drama of that late duel certainly outshined the excitement of the earlier men’s race. Mayr finished in 48:14 and Kisang was second in 48:51. Mayr, a seven-time world champion who was second at last year’s World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race, was incredible. Mayr, now age 43, is a former steeplechaser and a two-time Olympic marathoner. This was her first world championships win since 2016, and comes a remarkable 17 years after her first win in 2006. Her other wins came in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 — all uphill years, back when the championships alternated uphill and up-and-down years. Mayr, as with men’s winner Kipgneno, won €4,000. That was part of a total €16,500 cash purse that went five deep. Philaries Kisang on her way to finishing second at the 2023 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race.

2023 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Results: Victory for Manuel Merillas and Daniela Oemus,"Spain’sManuel Merillasand Germany’sDaniela Oemuswon the 2023Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon, in doing so ushering in first-time champions and new storylines to the iconic event. Like last year, the Zegama Marathon opened the 2023 Golden Trail World Series (GTWS) when the event started on Sunday morning local time, on May 14, 2023. The event is a doozy, delivering over 8,800 feet of climb in the marathon-length course through steep ascents and descents, and consistently technical terrain. An enthusiastic Florian Reichert running the 2023 Zegama Marathon. Photo: Golden Trail Series | Zegama Aizkorri Marathon | Martina Valmassoi Zegama also delivers one of the best fan-runner interaction experiences in the sport of trail running, with a purported 15,000-plus fans lining its mountainous course come rain or shine to watch the competition. While this year’s event didn’t match last year’s deep competition and fast-and-furious racing to both the women’s and men’s course records, set at 4:16:43 byNienke Brinkmanfor the women and 3:36:40 byKilian Jornetfor the men, it was the same celebratory party of trail running for which the event is known, along with plenty of competition to keep us all on our toes. Unlike last year’s nearly perfect racing weather, this year brought rain, thick clouds, and tricky underfoot conditions courtesy of that weather, likely slowing times on the burly course by a bit, but certainly not tempering the energy of both runners and fans. The 2023 Zegama Marathon saw a new champion in Germany’sDaniela Oemus, who crossed the line in 4:31:54. It was most certainly a breakout victory for Oemus, whose top results until now have been a fourth place at the 2022 Marathon Mont-Blanc and a 14th at the 2022 OCC. Oemus ran to victory through placing herself in podium position or nearly so from about 15 kilometers onward. She moved into first position by the halfway point, at the top of the Aizkorri climb, which is the course’s high point. From there, she added seconds to her lead at each of the checkpoints, including on the final technical downhill back to the town of Zegama. At the finish, she was just over 2 minutes clear of her nearest competitor. Daniela Oemus of Germany on her way to winning the 2023 Zegama Marathon. Photo: Golden Trail Series | Zegama Aizkorri Marathon | Martina Valmassoi Second place was New Zealand’sCaitlin Fielder, who finished in 4:34:04. Like champion Oemus, Fielder put herself in podium position early in the race and stuck with it, never falling back further than fourth position, no matter if it was a steep up or down, or one of the event’s sneakily fast flat sections. When she crossed the line to celebrate her second place, she had plenty of distance on third place, some 3.5 minutes. Theres Leboeufof Switzerland improved on both her place and time from the 2022 edition of this race, taking third in 4:37:41. Last year, she was seventh in 4:39:55. Full results.

Photo: Golden Trail Series | Zegama Aizkorri Marathon | Martina Valmassoi Because of the Zegama Marathon’s iconic status as a competitive spring mountain race, over the years it’s brought in the top competitors of mountain running, who often return year after year. Spain’sManuel Merillas’sstory is no different. Merillas has finished the event at least a half dozen times, landing on the podium multiple times and as close as second place in the past. In 2022, he took third in 3:45:43, we believe his fastest time at the event until now. This year, he vaulted all the way to the winner’s position, setting another Zegama Marathon personal best in 3:42:01. Merillas ran to victory using a style which has previously worked well for him, by letting others set the pace and moving up as the race progresses. This year, he moved into pole position by around 34k into the race, and increased his lead to a scant 27 seconds at the finish. Manuel Merillas on his way to winning the 2023 Zegama Marathon. Photo: Golden Trail Series | Zegama Aizkorri Marathon | Martina Valmassoi MoroccanElhousine Elazzaouialso improved on last year’s fourth place in taking second place this year, and a time improvement by about five minutes. Elazzaoui moved into podium position a few kilometers after the halfway point, and landed in second by around 28k in, a position he’d hold to the finish. Jon Albon, who is from the U.K., but who lives in Norway, took third place in 3:45:01. Albon raced steadily all race, running in or just beyond podium position by a couple seconds, from basically the first checkpoint onward. He even moved into the leadership position by 28k, before yielding it at about 34k, and moving back into third place by the finish line. Full results.

"2023 Transvulcania Ultramarathon by UTMB Results: Jones Earns Second Win, Valmassoi Her First","More than a decade after winning the 2012Transvulcania Ultramarathon by UTMB,Dakota Jonesreturned to the Spanish island of La Palma to earn his second victory in the 2023 edition. In the women’s race, decorated Italian mountain runnerMartina Valmassoicame away victorious. The 2023 Transvulcania Ultramarathon brought talent together from around the world. Notably, in contrast to more than a decade of strong performances from the host country, no Spanish man finished in the top 10 (Ignasi Ferrerwas 14th), whileCristina Santurinowas the top Spanish woman in 10th. Before dawn on Saturday morning, May 6, from El Faro de Fuencaliente, the south tip of La Palma island, Transvulcania fired off and runners raced for the sky. By the time the 72-kilometer (44.7 miles) course concluded in the city of Los Llanos de Aridane on the island’s west side, participants racked up some 4,600 meters (15,000 feet) of climbing. During that distance, they ran through volcanic cinder, over lava rocks, among the island’s famous banana plantations, over the island’s approximately 2,420-meter (7,940 feet) high point, and on the race course’s infamous descent from that high point to sea level. Dakota Jones after earning his second win at the 2023 Transvulcania Ultramrarathon by UTMB. Photo: Transvulcania Ultramarathon by UTMB Once things shook out over the first two hours, the 2023 Transvulcania Ultramarathon turned into a three-woman race. Poland’sEdyta Lewandowskawas the pacesetter on the women’s side, going through Los Canarios seven kilometers into the race in 49:19, a full two minutes ahead of South Africa’sMeg MackenzieandMartina Valmassoiof Italy. From there, Lewandowska continued to hold a two-to-four-minute lead over Valmassoi in second though El Reventón (31 kilometers), while Mackenzie settled into third, running by herself in the women’s race. As the race continued its relentless climb, Lewandowska added to her lead over Valmassoi, expanding it to seven minutes at 37k, 12 minutes at 46k, and 14.5 minutes at the race’s high point of Roque de los Muchachos (51k). And, then, Valmassoi started descending. Wow. Just nine kilometers later at the checkpoint of Torre del Time, Valmassoi had cut a full 13 minutes off of Lewandowska’s lead, trailing by merely a minute and a half. Fast forward to the next checkpoint in the seaside town of Tazacorte at 68k and Valmassoi had a 13-minute lead on Lewandowska with less than five kilometers to go. Game over. Martina Valmassoi won the 2023 Transvulcania Ultramarathon in 9:09:13. Edyta Lewandowska held on to second, finishing in a time of 9:21:40, while Meg Mackenzie continued onto to the finish in Los Llanos de Aridane in her long-held third position in 9:28:06. Notably, Mackenzie was a full half an hour behind Lewandowska at the race’s highpoint at 51k, and closed the gap to just seven and a half minutes at the finish.

Fourteen kilometers later at El Reventón (31k), Reiterer and Jones had a few-second lead on Humbert. From there, Jones made what would become the decisive move of the race, putting more than a minute on Humbert and four on Reiterer by Punta de los Roques at 37k. Jones added a small amount to his lead as the race continued to climb to its highpoint at Roque de los Muchachos (51k) and then quickly added even more to his lead at the start of the nearly 8,000-foot descent from peak to ocean. After the relatively small climb back to the finish in Los Llanos de Aridane, Dakota Jones won in 7:02:16 with Damien Humbert taking second exactly eight minutes later in 7:10:16. After spending the second half of the race running alone in third, Andreas Reiterer held onto that position, finishing in 7:17:26.

"2023 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: McKnight Makes Comeback, Ostaszewski Takes Gold","There was plenty of drama in the 2023Cocodona 250 Mile— it just happened over days of running through the Arizona desert. The 2023 edition began on Monday, May 1, and concludes on Saturday, May 6. Now in its third year, the ultramarathon once again delivered the goods. The route begins in Black Canyon City and finishes in Flagstaff. With nearly 40,000 feet of elevation gain, a maximum altitude of 9,135 feet, and a cutoff time of 125 hours, the Cocodona 250 Mile demands every ounce of physical and mental strength from its runners.

After snagging a second-place finishlast year,Michael McKnightdelivered a time of 69:41:31 to take first place this week — but it was a rocky road. “Michael suffered through some tough patches in the first half of the race but rallied hard and put the hammer down in the higher elevations to wind his way up to the win,” the race organization wrote onInstagram. Josh Perrycame in second with a finish time of 70:57:52. He showed the traits of a seasoned thru hiker by delivering a swift and steady performance, organizers said. Coming in third wasMichael Greerwith a finish time of 72:47:07. Greer dropped out of the race line-up last year after a fall left him with a broken hip just a few weeks before the race. Returning this year — and making it to the podium — marks another remarkable comeback story. Michael McKnight on his way to winning the 2023 Cocodona 250 Mile. Photo courtesy of Michael McKnight.

2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships Results: Murphy is Double Champion and Curts Cleans Up,"[Editor’s Note:This article is written by guest writer,Jim Graham. Also, our article with Saturday’s2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships resultsis now live.] When veteran New Hampshire mountain runner and race co-directorTom Hooperposted a pre-race note advising, “Wear shoes with large lugs,” it meant that an already technical course would be downright epic on Sunday, April 30, for the 2023USATF Mountain Running Championships. Rain-soaked with deep mud, loose leaves, slippery roots, and even slush, the championships event at Mount Sunapee featured deep men’s and women’s fields, vying for spots on Team USA at the 2023 World Trail and Mountain Running Championships in Innsbruck, Austria, June 6 to 10. It wasDaniel CurtsandGrayson Murphywho, ahem, weathered the conditions best to win Sunday’s race. Curts’s win follows his third place at Saturday’s USATF Vertical Mountain Championships, and Murphy doubled up with wins in both days’ events. You can read our2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships results articlefor more of that race story. “The talent here was amazing for both the men and women, so seeing athletes of that caliber racing on such a technical course on a day like this was absolutely amazing,” Hooper said. The light rain that arrived midway through Saturday’s vertical race turned into a downpour overnight, with temperatures dipping to the low 40s Fahrenheit and the wind gusting to over 30 miles per hour by Sunday morning. Covering 8.2 miles with 3,400 feet of elevation gain, the two-lap course was designed with the world championships in mind, saidPaul Kirsch, race co-director. “We pride ourselves on designing challenging courses that will give the U.S. the best team possible, and these courses are a great test for selecting our top runners for Austria,” Kirsch said. Grayson Murphyfollowed up Saturday’s USATF Vertical Mountain Championships victory with another commanding win in this classic up/down race, finishing in 1:08:56, leadingAllie McLaughlin, 1:11:53;Rachel Tomajczyk, 1:16:35; andKasie Enman, 1:16:40. These top four made the U.S. team. This means that this year’s Team USA women’s classic up/down team will contain three world champions: Murphy, who was the 2019 World Mountain Running Championships winner; McLaughlin, the 2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill winner; and Enman, the 2011 World Mountain Running Championships winner. “We have such a strong team and with such great experience, I’m really excited to see what we can do in Austria,” Murphy said. Starting at the base of the mountains, Murphy and McLaughlin stayed close through most of the first climb, with Murphy opening a gap on a flatter section near the summit and gaining a lead of about a minute. But Murphy knew she’d have to stay aggressive down the steep and untracked ski-area glades just beyond, which saw runners taking spills throughout the day. “Allie’s a great competitor. She always comes prepared and shows up with her A game, so I knew I couldn’t afford to back off,” said Murphy, who extended her lead to 1:36 by the end of the first lap. McLaughlin, who will compete in both the vertical and classic up/down world championships races, said she’s worked hard on her downhill technique since she began preparing for the Alaska’sMount Marathon Racelast year, which she won in course-record-setting time. “I could see how strong Grayson was on the downhills, so I really just tried to focus on holding on and having fun with it, without taking any huge risks,” she said.

Daniel Curtssaid he had hoped for a better finish in Saturday’s vertical race, where he took third place, and he went to bed Saturday night thinking about redemption and a win in Sunday’s classic up/down race. But he wasn’t so sure when he woke up. “Honestly, my legs felt terrible when I got up. I actually had doubts about finishing,” Curts said. “But as we got closer to the race and I warmed up a little, it all came back pretty well.” Going out in a tight group, Curts gradually opened a small gap by the summit and completed the first lap in the lead by 24 seconds. Keeping the pressure on, Curts padded his lead on the second lap climb, winning in 1:01:04. He was followed closely throughout by a pack that included CanadianAlexandre Ricard, who won the vertical race on Saturday and was second on Sunday, in 1:02:43;Morgan Elliott, 1:02:51;Liam Meirow, 1:03:16; CanadianRémi Leroux, 1:03:26; andEdward Owens, 1:03:27. Curts, Elliot, Meirow, and Owens qualified for the U.S. team, with Ricard and Leroux being Canadian. “Basically, I knew I was okay at the top of the second loop, so after that I really focused on staying composed and staying on my feet,” Curts said. “It was a tough course out there, and it would’ve really easy to take a spill.” Daniel Curts on his way to winning the 2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships.

2023 Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile and 100k Results: Ultramarathon Sprint Finishes and Golden Tickets Galore,"Change was in the air at this year’s Canyons by UTMB event, held on Friday and Saturday, April 28 and 29, in Auburn, California. There was the addition of a new 100-mile race, as well as a change to a multi-looped format for both the 100-kilometer and 100-mile races, as opposed to the net uphill, point-to-point course which the 100k had traditionally followed. The new routes for both the 100k and 100 miler promised to stay on the historic Western States Trail for at least 50% of the distance — taking in 10,500 feet and 17,000 feet of elevation gain respectively — but avoided the parts of the trail still feeling the effects of record snowfall this past winter. The 2023Canyons by UTMB 100khad its appeal as the final Western States 100 Golden Ticket race, where the top-two women and men earn entry into the race. The winners wereIda Nilsson, a Swede who lives in Norway, andCole Watson, and both were successful in their second attempts at securing Golden Tickets this year. The event was also a UTMB World Series Major, meaning the top-10 men and women in the 50k, 100k, and 100-mile races secured entry into the UTMB Worlds Series finals, held this August, in Chamonix, France. This brought some competition especially to the 2023Canyons by UTMB 100 Milefor its promised spots on the 2023 UTMB start line, where wins were credited toMathieu Clément, of Switzerland, andAlyssa Clark. In this article, we first break down the 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100k, and follow it up with details from the 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile.

He had moved into podium position by halfway, eventually taking the lead at Drivers Flat at 78k, to win the race in a time of 8:34:39. Watson missed out on the Golden Ticket with afourth-place finish at the Black Canyon 100kearlier this year, but has now earned his ticket to the Western States 100. From what we understand, he immediately accepted it. Adam Merry— who formed part of the USA team whotook gold at the 2022 Trail World Championships 80k— also started further back to climb up through the field, moving into second position with 10k to go. He finished second in 8:50:40, affording him the opportunity to join those gold-medal-winning teammatesAdam PetermanandJeff Coltat the Western States 100. Justin Grunewaldbounced back from a DNF at the McDowell Mountain Frenzy 50 Mile two weeks ago to take third in 8:53:30, just three minutes back from Merry, who had passed him in the race’s closing stages.

Ida Nilsson, of Sweden but living in Norway, really wanted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Flying all the way to the Black Canyon 100k this past February, andmissing the ticket with a fifth-place finish, she returned to the U.S. to race this event. She held off the rest of the women’s field commandingly, to cross the line in 9:51:07, and eagerly accepted that coveted Golden Ticket. Canada’sPriscilla Forgiewas the second-place woman, crossing the line some nine minutes after Nilsson. While she earned a Golden Ticket, we understand she’s taking some time to decide if she’ll accept it. Spain’sAroa Siowas back this year, after takingthird at last year’s Canyons by UTMB 100k. Well guess what, third place for her again, rounding out an all-international podium. Ida Nilsson wins the 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100k.

Neither could shake the other until the home stretch — the actual finish chute — when Clément outsprinted Luo for the win. Both started reasonably conservatively, running in sixth and seventh respectively by the first checkpoint 5k in, before steadily climbing up the field. Luo was the aggressor and was steadily gaining momentum for the first third of the race, before taking the lead by the first Browns Bar checkpoint, around the 30k mark. Clément had taken a little longer to make his move, but by the second Browns Bar checkpoint at 49k, he had crept his way up the field and overtaken Luo to move into the lead, by a margin of 32 seconds. We believe that was about the biggest gap there would be between the two for the rest of the day, as Luo caught up and they mostly ran the second half of the race together until that sprint finish. Canyon Woodwardhad started out ahead of the two eventual winners, running in second at the 5k mark at No Hands Bridge, and briefly held the lead at the 23k mark. He fell back as far as ninth at the Mammoth Bar checkpoint, but recovered well to take the third podium spot in 17:46:05. Mathieu Clément, 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile champion.

This continues a great run of form for Clark, who also won the 2023 Hurt 100 Mile, as well as last year’s Lake Sonoma 100k and Moab 240 Mile. Alexis Crellinran close to Clark all day, and just five minutes separated the two at Foresthill checkpoint at 106k, but Clark pulled away in the race’s final third. Crellin ultimately finished second in 20:55:06. Prolific 100-mile racerAnnie Hughesclosed out the podium in 21:26, after running much of the race in third place. Hughes was the winner of the 2021 Leadville Trail 100 Mile, as well as the 2022 Cocodona 250 Mile and Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile. Alyssa Clark, 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile champion.

"2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships Results: Murphy, Ricard, and Gray Prevail","[Editor’s Note:This article is written by guest writer,Jim Graham. Also, our article with Sunday’s2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships resultsis now live.] From smooth dirt road to slick roots, mud, and rocky climbs with grades up 40%, New Hampshire’s Mount Sunapee delivered every condition imaginable over four miles and 1,900 feet of gain to test top mountain running talents in the 2023USATF Vertical Mountain Championships. In the women’s race,Grayson Murphytook home the win via a huge gap on the rest of the field, to become the 2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships winner. In the men’s open race, CanadianAlexandre Ricardwas victorious, while second place and the first American home wasJoseph Gray, 2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships winner. On day one of the two-day 2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships, hosted this year by theSunapee Scramble, the USATF Vertical Mountain Championships saw the top-three women and top-four men vying for national team selection for the World Trail and Mountain Running Championships in Austria, from June 6 to 10. The 2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill champion,Allie McLaughlin, earned an automatic spot to compete on Team USA’s vertical team in Austria, leaving one less women’s spot to be claimed at this event. Runners return to Mount Sunapee on Sunday, April 30, for the classic up/down mountain race, the USATF Mountain Running Championships, an 8.2-mile, two-loop race — and with heavy rain in the forecast overnight, a proving ground for both mountain runners and mud-taming trail shoes. Awarding $6,000 in total prize money, the Sunapee Scramble weekend is the first time that the U.S. has hosted a two-day championship to select Team USA’s vertical and classic up/down teams. Grayson Murphyopened a commanding lead from the get-go, hitting the singletrack more than a minute up on the field, and extending the gap through the gnarly climbs and winning the USATF Vertical Mountain Championships title in 35:47, more than four minutes up. Taking second wasRachel Tomajczyk, 40:28; andAlexandra Lawson, 41:03, with the top-three women punching their tickets to Austria. A cold drizzle that arrived mid-race turned into steady, wind-driven rain, adding a new level of challenge for even the top women finishers. “I wanted to go out hard and see if I could open things up before we went on the singletrack,” said Murphy, who is also racing Sunday’s classic up/down event. “Then I was hoping I could just chill on the second half, where it was so technical I knew it’d be harder for anyone to make up a lot of time.” Grayson Murphy on her way to winning the 2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships at the Sunapee Scramble. Photo: Joe Viger Full results. Strategy proved critical over the first 1.5 miles, with the leaders jockeying for position on a smooth gravel road before dropping down onto rugged singletrack, where steep, wet, and technical climbs made picking a line and passing an added challenge. CanadianAlexandre Ricardled a tight pack of five into the woods and never let up, taking the overall win in the open race, in 32:12. Leading the U.S. men and winning the USATF Vertical Mountain Championships title was perennial favoriteJoseph Gray, second overall in 32:23. He was followed closely byDaniel Curts, 32:28;Edward Owens, 32:40; andGarrett Corcoran, 32:43. Those top-four Americans earned spots on Team USA. Following Ricard closely, Gray took a bad fall on the technical second half, dropping to third before recovering to grab another national title. “I took a spill and lost some time there, so I was glad I was able to recover and move back up a bit,” said Gray, who will focus on the vertical race at worlds in June. “I went down pretty hard, so I was a little worried after that and played it safe to the end.” Alexandre Ricard (foreground) the 2023 Sunapee Scramble Vertical Race men’s winner, and Joseph Gray (background) the 2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships winner.

2023 Marathon des Sables Results: Victory for Mohamed El Morabity and Maryline Nakache,"For the 2023Marathon des Sables, victory goes toMohamed El Morabityof Morocco andMaryline Nakacheof France. Taking place in the Sahara Desert in Morocco, the 2023 edition of the 250-kilometer (150 miles), seven-day, five-stage race kicked off on Sunday, April 23, with the final competitive stage closing on Friday, April 28. Mohamed El Morabity on his way to winning the 2023 Marathon des Sables. Photo: iRunFar/Jon Bromley Each year, more than 1,000 runners compete in the event’s five competitive stages, sleep at night in campsites, and operate with food and gear self-sufficiency. The race organization provides a shade tent in the camp, plenty of water, and medical and emergency assistance, when needed. Given it takes place in the Sahara Desert, the event is known for its heat, as well as its sandy and rocky terrain. Official weather sources pointed to temperatures tipping over the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) mark during several days of this year’s event, and thermometers on the ground pitched up above 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 Celsius). There were big upsets in the latter stages of both the men’s and women’s races, with nine-time championRachid El Morabityof Moroccowithdrawing after receiving a penalty for an infringementfollowing the fourth stage, while in second place in the overall classification. On the women’s side, 2019 champion, race leader for the first three stages, and Dutch runner and firm favoriteRagna Debatsstruggled with digestive issues during the long Stage 4, and fell back out of contention for the win. Although Mohamed El Morabity’s victory might be somewhat tainted by the controversy surrounding his older brother’s withdrawal, Mohamed ran a stormer of a race, had already finished first in three of the four stages, and was in the lead overall at the time of the incident. While he’s finished in second place a remarkable five times at this event – each time behind his brother — this is his first victory of the Marathon des Sables. Women’s champion Maryline Nakache had also run a steady and consistent race from the start, finishing second in each of the first four stages before ultimately moving into the overall women’s lead during Stage 4. This was her debut Marathon des Sables. Maryline Nakache, 2023 Marathon des Sables women’s champion. Photo: iRunFar/Jon Bromley It was a speedy start to the week, with the first stage being about 36 kilometers long, featuring a climb to the summit of this event’s infamous Jebel El Otfal. Stormy and windy conditions in the afternoon made things difficult for the latter runners, but the front end of the race was largely unaffected by the storm. Stage 1 went along predicted lines, withRachid El Morabitytaking the lead and finishing the stage in a time of 2:46. His younger brother,Mohamed El Morabity, and fellow Moroccan,Aziz Yachou, followed just a minute back in 2:47. The 2022 UTMB second-place man,Mathieu Blanchard, of France, was the first overseas runner to finish the stage, in fourth place in a time of 2:51. Stage 2 was a bit shorter at just under 32k, but it moved into more technical terrain with increased elevation change. Rachid again took off in front, but in the latter part of the stage and on a smooth run into the finish, he was overtaken by his brother Mohamed, who won the stage in a time of 2:29, less than a minute ahead of Rachid in second and Yachou in third. Rachid still held the overall lead by a narrow margin at the end of the stage, followed by Mohamed and Yachou. Blanchard, who had finished fifth in the second stage behind Russia’sVasilii Korytkin, held on to fourth place overall. Aziz Yachou takes second at the 2023 Marathon des Sables. Photo: iRunFar/Jon Bromley In the third stage of around 34k, Mohamed asserted his dominance, winning the stage in 2:30 to Rachid and Yachou’s 2:33, and extending his overall lead to three minutes. Blanchard continued to hold his own in fourth place. The men’s podium race for Stage 4 was so tight, especially given that it was the one long stage in the week in racing, this year clocked at 90k. Mohamed again crossed the line first, in 8:14:39. Yachou finished the stage in second place, just six seconds behind the lead, and Rachid arrived in third, only 19 seconds behind the winner. This tight race kept Mohamed in the lead in the overall classification, Rachid in second, and Yachou in third, but with a spread of only a few minutes. Controversy ensued following this fourth stage, when Rachid was issued a three-hour time penalty for receiving outside assistance and withdrew from the race, which we have more on ina separate news piece. After Rachid withdrew from the race, Yachou moved up to second place in the overall classification. Blanchard, who was steadily running his own race behind the leaders, now found himself in podium position. On the marathon-distance Stage 5, the last competitive stage, Mohamed continued his show of strength to finish in 3:18, five minutes clear of Yachou in second. In a total time of 19:19:54 for the five competitive stages, Mohamed El Morabity was crowned the 2023 Marathon des Sables men’s champion. A battle ensued behind, with Vasilii Korytkin eventually beating Blanchard to the line, to take third place in Stage 5. However, Blanchard hung on to third place overall in a time of 21:21:27.

The fast first stage was dominated as expected by 2019 winnerRagna Debats, who finished in 3:26, almost 10 minutes clear ofMaryline Nakachein second. The top local wasAziza El Amranyof Morocco, who followed in third in 3:53. While this was Nakache’s first appearance at this race, El Amrany was returning following a third place at the 2022 edition. The more mountainous terrain on Stage 2 played to Debats’s strengths, and she romped home in 3:19 to Nakache’s 3:36, thus extending her overall lead to around 28 minutes. El Amrany continued to run steady in third position. Into the third stage, Debats finished 11 minutes ahead of Nakache, for the stage win. But Debats’s finish time and place doesn’t reveal the full story, that she lagged for a period during Stage 3, was passed and lost the lead, before regaining it to win the stage. As we would soon see, this was a harbinger of problems to come for Debats. El Armany again finished the stage in third, but this time only a minute back from Nakache and appearing very comfortable.

Photo: iRunFar/Jon Bromley As we all now know, everything changed in the fourth day — the notorious long stage, which was 90k for 2023. Debats led at first, but then fell back a few hours after the start, reportedly suffering digestive issues. Admirably, although no longer in contention for a podium spot, she powered on to finish the stage in 21:34, nine hours and 49 minutes back of the lead. El Amrany, who appeared to be getting stronger as the week went on, won the stage in 11:44. Nakache again took second, this time trailing a different leader, and moved into pole position in the race overall, still almost 33 minutes ahead of El Armany in the overall classification. For Stage 5, the race’s final competitive stage, Nakache sailed smoothly to the stage victory, finishing the day’s marathon distance in 4:18. This sealed Maryline Nakache’s victory at the 2023 Marathon des Sables with a total time of 27:02:17. On this final day,Tomomi Bitoh, of Japan, was across the line in second in 4:33, and El Amrany crossed just a few minutes later in 4:36 in third place. El Amrany had a significant lead in second place, over Bitoh in third in the overall classification, so a fast finish was not needed. Following up on her third place last year, Aziza El Amrany improves to take second in the 2023 Marathon des Sables women’s race in 27:53:37, and Tomomi Bitoh took third in 29:39:51. Early leader Debats finished in eighth place in the overall classification for the women. Tomomi Bitoh looking very happy on her way to finishing third at the 2023 Marathon des Sables.

"2023 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: France Dominates, with Wins for Manon Bohard and Lambert Santelli","The 2023Madeira Island Ultra-Trailkicked off at midnight local time on Saturday, April 22. The 115-kilometer (72 miles) route travels from northeast to southwest, spanning the full width of the beautiful and rugged island of Madeira. Along the way, it takes in 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of arduous climbing and technical descending, beginning at sea level and climbing to almost 1,800 meters (5,900 feet) at its highest point at Pico Ruivo. This year’s line-up was less competitive on both the men’s and women’s side to last year’s race, which saw both thewomen’s and men’s event records shattered, byCourtney DauwalterandJim Walmsley, respectively. Where the Americans had dominated last year, this year was a French sweep, with French runners taking the win in both the men’s and women’s races. Men’s winner,Lambert Santelli, was 10th in last year’s race and fifth in the 2019 edition. He managed to improve on his own time from last year by 38 minutes. Women’s winnerManon Bohardplaced second in the 85k race at MIUT back in 2019. The 2021TDSwinner was right at home on this technical course, and stormed her debut at the 115k main event.

All photos: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks It was a decisive win for France’sManon Bohard, who by the top of the first major climb, 14.5 kilometers in, had already established a lead of just over a minute on chaserAbby Hall(USA), who was two minutes clear ofLucie Jamsin(France) in third. Past halfway at Curral das Freiras, 63k, Hall still hung on in second place, but Bohard had steadily extended her lead and was now almost 20 minutes clear in front. Meanwhile, Jamsin in third was applying pressure from behind and had closed the gap on second to a minute and a half. Hall was found wanting on the mammoth climb that followed — 1,475 meters over 11k — to Pico Ruivo, the highest terrain of the route. Bohard summitted 19 minutes ahead of Jamsin in second, who was now almost 10 minutes clear of Hall in third.

Faria Meanwhile, Switzerland’sLuzia Buehler, who had sat patiently in fifth place for the race’s first half, moved into fourth position by the high point at Pico Ruivo. She passed Hall on the rough, undulating 9k section that followed to Chão da Lagoa, by which point she had moved into podium position. By the race’s final checkpoint at Porto da Cruz, 101k in, Bohard had put down an untouchable 45-minute lead. Jamsin followed in second, still 11 minutes clear of Buehler in third — who was more than a half an hour ahead of the rest of the field. Having continued to extend her lead all day, Manon Bohard romped home in a time of 15 hours and 48 minutes, the 2023 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail women’s champion. Luzia Buehler — having spent more than half of the race in fifth place before moving up to third for the last quarter — had a stormer of a last section, where she passed Jamsin to finish in second place in a time of 16:40. Lucie Jamsin held on for third, crossing the line seven minutes later in a time of 16:47. France’s Lucie Jamsin on her way to taking third at the 2023 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail.

At 14.5k in, with already 1,515 meters climbed, just 32 seconds separated the top-four men as they reached the mountain plateau of Fanal — known for its ancient forests. These were Madeira Island’sLuís Fernandes, Sweden’sPetter Engdahl, and French runners Lambert Santelli andBenoît Girondel. By the end of the first technical descent to Chão da Ribeira, the same group made up the top four, with Fernandes having moved two minutes clear of Santelli, who was now in second place. The lead group continued to trade places, with Engdahl leading for a time before Santelli moved into pole position before the 48k checkpoint at Encumeada.

Faria Things then took a turn for the worse for Engdahl, who fell back from first to seventh position in the 16k stretch between Estanquinhos and Encumeada. He reportedly spent 20 minutes in the aid station being attended to by his crew before carrying on, but called it a day before the next checkpoint. Another French runner, 23-year-oldHugo Deck, had climbed up the field to second place by Encumeada and remained in the top three through 84k, but then also withdrew from the race. When the frontrunners reached the 63k checkpoint, Girondel had replaced Deck in second place behind Santelli and the two held position for the rest of the race, with Santelli crossing the line in 14 hours and one minute. Girondel, who excels in technical ultras — having previously won the 2018Diagonale des Fousand placed second in the 2021 TDS — followed 12 minutes later, to take second place in 14 hours and 13 minutes. Having lead the race in the early stages, and never fallen back further than sixth place, Madeira’s Luís Fernandes closed out the podium in a time of 14 hours and 23 minutes.

2023 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results: Victory for Drew Holmen and Erin Clark,"The 2023Lake Sonoma 50 Milesaw the race return to its former prominence as one of the most competitive ultramarathons in the U.S. this year. Kicking off at 6:30 a.m. local time on the shores of Lake Sonoma outside Healdsburg, California, both the women’s and men’s races saw large packs whittled down over the first 20 or so miles of the race, before an eventual leader emerged, who’d later be overtaken before the finish line. In the end, it wasDrew HolmenandErin Clarkwho would come out on top after tight battles through the front of both fields. This year sees the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile run on a new course, with the biggest change being a move of the start/finish to the park’s visitor center. The current course features nearly 10,000 feet (9,915 feet/3,302 meters) of climb and an equal amount of descent over its relentlessly rolling 50.8 miles (81.8 kilometers). The previous course had a reported 10,500 feet (3,200 meters) of climb, but that’s well within the margin of error. Still, it’s best to consider this an entirely new course and only roughly compare this year’s times with those of the past. For 2023, the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile served as a qualifier for the 2023Trail World Championships80-kilometer race, which will be held in June, in Austria. The men’s and women’s podium finishers earned spots on Team USA. Erin Clark on her way to winning the 2023 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile.

By mile 21, passing through the Madrone aid station outbound,Morgan Elliothad roughly a minute lead withPreston Cates,Zach Perrin,Drew Holmen,Seth Ruhling, andCaleb Olsonabout a minute back and withMatthew Seidel,Tracen Knopp, andRichard Lockwoodall within roughly another minute. Midway though the race, Elliot continued to hold a minute lead on the field at Lone Rock, but he fell back to third with Holmen and Perrin together out in front by the return trip through Madrone at mile 30.4. Eight miles later, on the second pass through Warm Springs Creek at mile 38, Holmen had a full eight-minute lead on Olson, with Cates and Knopp running together in third, 10.5 minutes off the lead, and Lockwood holding fifth just over 15 minutes off the front.

Preston Cates pulled away from Tracen Knopp with the pair finishing third and fourth respectively.Chris Myersmoved up in in the final miles to take fifth, only a few seconds behind fourth place. Full results. At mile 13, the Warm Springs Creek aid station saw the first 25 runners through being all men and, then, what must have been the remnants of the women’s pack, as the next 13 runners through were all women.Tara Fraga,Hannah Osowski,Sarah Biehl,Anne-Marie Madden, andErin Clarkwere the first five in that train, but all 13 passed through within three and a half minutes. Eight miles later, outbound at the Madrone aid station, it was still 13-straight women after the first set of men. Osowski and Clark led that group with Fraga and Biehl less than a minute back andAllison Baca,Sarah Keyes, and Madden in another group less than 90 seconds off the lead. Midway through the race, Keyes had a smallest of leads on Baca with Clark still within a minute of the front. Osowski and Fraga ran together less than two minutes off the lead. What a race! Another four miles closer to the finish at Madrone inbound (mile 30.4), Keyes had built a 90-second lead on Baca with Clark less than two minutes off the front and both Osowski and Fraga still within five minutes of the lead. By mile 38 at Warm Springs inbound, Clark had closed the gap to Keyes with the pair now running together at the head of the women’s race, and with Baca in third still less than three minutes off the lead. Six minutes off the front, Osowski continued to run in fourth, whileLauren Puretzhad passed Fraga to move into fifth by the smallest of margins.

Meanwhile, Osowski was less than three minutes out of second with Fraga having repassed Puretz to hold fifth position by a mere 90 seconds. After seven hours of tight racing, It was Erin Clark who broke the tape for the women with a five-minute victory over Allison Baca. Sarah Keyes took third less than three and a half minutes behind Baca, and Hannah Osowski took fourth, less than 10 minutes behind the winner. Tara Fraga held off Lauren Puretz to take fifth.

"Sanchez, Kelly, and Sabbe Finish the 2023 Barkley Marathons","After 60 hours of brutal racing at the 2023Barkley Marathons,Aurélien Sanchezof France finished in 58 hours, 23 minutes, and 12 seconds in his first finish of the infamous event. A short time later,John Kellyarrived at the finish in 58:42:23, becoming a two-time finisher and one of only three people to have finished the event more than once. A bit over an hour later and with only 6.5 minutes to spare on the event’s 60-hour cutoff, Belgium’sKarel Sabbebecame the third finisher in this year’s event after crossing the line in 59:53:33. Earlier in the event, the U.K.’sJasmin Parisbecame the second woman ever to start the fourth lap of the five-lap event in the event’s 36-year history. A file photo of Aurélien Sanchez during the 2019 John Cappis 50k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The event got underway on Tuesday, March 14, in Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee. The notoriously brutal and mostly off-trail route covers roughly 130 miles and takes in about 63,000 feet of elevation gain. Runners are allotted 60 hours to complete all five 26-ish-mile loops, and up until this year’s event, only 15 runners had successfully done so in the race’s 36-year history. This year marked better weather than the event has seen in years, with the main environmental challenges being long hours of darkness and cold nights in the late winter setting. Rain and fog, which have been omnipresent in some years, were absent in 2023. In one of the sport’s greatest quirks, due to the course’s remote location and an imperative to protect the ecosystem in which the event takes place, which precludes observation of the event by most anyone besides a select few members of the media, nearly the entirety of the event coverage came via theTwitter feed of ultrarunner and longtime Barkley reporterKeith Dunn. Read on for more details on how the event played out on the men’s and women’s sides. The famous license plates at the start of the 2023 Barkley Marathons. Each participant brings a license plate of their home to the event. Photo: John Fegyveresi The men’s race had a promising field, including three-time Barkley Marathons finisherJared Campbell,Nickademus de la Rosa, who finished in 2013, and the most recent finisher — from 2017 —John Kelly. As ever, the attrition rate was high for the first couple of loops. Campbell completed three loops within the 36-hour time limit to proceed onto loop 4 but opted not to continue and settled for a Fun Run finish. John Kelly beginning his fifth and final loop of the 2023 Barkley Marathons, on his way to his second Barkley finish. Photo: John Fegyveresi However, some of the others had not yet had enough, and the race that is normally more about survival was evolving into a neck-and-neck battle. Just over 32 hours in, within seconds of each other,Albert Herreroof Spain, Kelly, and the U.K.’sDamian Hallall finished loop 3. Kelly was out on loop 4 first, after 23 minutes, with Hall hot on his heels. Herrero took a little longer and embarked on loop 4 with 33:03 on the clock. Three more men made it within the 36-hour time limit and opted to head out on loop 4, includingAurélien Sanchezof France. With just two more drops from the men’s field on loop 4, for the first time in Barkley Marathons history, four runners headed out on loop 5. These were, in order: John Kelly, Aurélien Sanchez,Karel Sabbeof Belgium, and Damian Hall. Kelly was first out with 46:02 on the clock, allowing him almost 14 hours to complete his final loop. In one of the many intricacies inherent to Barkley, where the runner is allowed to choose direction as the first runner, Kelly opted to run the final loop clockwise, with all subsequent runners alternating direction. One hour and 47 minutes separated the four remaining runners as they set out on loop 5, but Sanchez was hot on Kelly’s heels, heading out just five minutes after the leader, though in the opposite direction on the course. Karel Sabbe (right) before starting his fifth and final loop of the 2023 Barkley Marathons. Photo: John Fegyveresi A Tweet from Keith Dunn read:“John is limping, Aurélien is sprinting. In each of their minds, there is a halfway point in loop five, and both want to reach that point first. We have a race.” It was game over for Hall early on loop 5. Having reportedly gotten lost on Chimney Top, he returned to base with no book pages that serve as intra-lap progress markers. After starting loop 5 in second place by only a few minutes, Aurélien Sanchez ultimately crossed the line to become a finisher in 58:23:12. A scant 19 or so minutes in arrears, it was John Kelly across the line in 58:42:23. This was Kelly’s second finish of the notorious event. Readhis report from his 2017 finish. Belgium’sKarel Sabbebecame the third finisher in this year’s event. He crossed the line in 59:53:33, as runners and crews watched his headlamp approach in the night, tension building on if he’d make it before time was up. He did, crossing the line just 6.5 minutes before the event’s 60-hour cutoff. John Kelly resting after finishing the Barkley Marathons for the second time.

Among what we believe were eight women on the start line wasAndrea Larson, who twice finished fourth at theBandera 100kand earned her spot at the Barkley Marathons with a win at the 2022Barkley Fall Classic— or the “Baby Barkley.” Also on the women’s roster, we learned as the race progressed, wasKatie Wright(U.K., lives in New Zealand), who, among her notable finishes, was one of the last four people standing at the 2019Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra. In the women’s ranks were the U.K.’sNicky SpinksandJasmin Paris. Spinks and Paris each seemed ideal candidates to be the first woman to complete the Barkley. In 2022, Paris was the first woman in a decade to complete three of the five loops inside of 40 hours — to be awarded a Fun Run finish. In 2019, Spinks, alongsideStephanie Caseof Canada, completed one loop and retired midway through the second loop amid deteriorating weather conditions. Jasmin Paris being crewed in between loops of the 2023 Barkley Marathons. She made history by becoming the second woman ever to start loop 4 of the five-loop event, though she was unable to finish. Photo: John Fegyveresi This year, as always, there were casualties in the field from the get-go, with Keith Dunn Tweeting:“Andrea KooimanandEBdid not complete loop one after getting off course and ending up at Gobey Church (a runner made the same mistake last year). Gutted for both of them.” Paris put in a supreme effort, bettering her 2022 performance by finishing three loops in 35:40, down from her previous best of 39:49. She had a strong start, finishing loop 1 in a time of 8:36. She was back at the finish of loop 2 with 21:13 on the clock, and following a tight turnaround, was out on loop 3 by 21:27 elapsed. She completed the loop just 20 minutes inside the cut-off to continue — also bagging another Fun Run finish — but was ultimately timed out on loop 4, returning with nine pages gathered within the allotted time. Spinks completed the first loop in 11:35 but was ultimately timed out on loop 2. She arrived in good spirits at the finish of the loop. Once again, there was no women’s finisher at the 2023 Barkley Marathons, but Jasmin Paris continued to push the women’s race a little closer to the mark. Paris is only the second woman ever to set out on loop 4, withSue Johnstonhaving been the first in 2001.

"2023 Transgrancanaria Classic 128k Results: Andreu Simon Wins, Courtney Dauwalter Dominates","The 2023Transgrancanaria Classic 128k, the queen race of the Transgrancanaria (TGC) festival of races, started at midnight local time on Saturday, February 25, in Las Canteras on the northeastern coast of the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. Over the next 30 hours, more than 600 runners attempted to cover the 79.5 miles (128 kilometers) and 23,160 feet (7,060 meters) of vertical gain before reaching the outskirts of the town of Maspalomas on the island’s southern shore. The race kicked off the 2023 Spartan Trail World Championships series in the Ultra category alongside the TGC Marathon event in the Trail category. After a cold and cloudy night, there were some hours of great running conditions before things got hot around Garañon at 90k. After some early front running byClaudia Tremps(Spain) andJazmine Lowther(Canada),Courtney Dauwalter(U.S.) would go onto yet another dominating win in the women’s race, with Lowther and Tremps running in second and third, respectively, for the final three-quarters of the race. While the women quickly sorted into their final finishing order for the podium, the men’s race saw many of its early leaders eventually withdraw from the race. That said,Andreu Simon(Spain) was always near the front on the way to his win, whileMiguel Arsénio(Portugal) andTyler Green(U.S.) were patient and took advantage of the attrition in the men’s race to finish second and third, respectively. Read on for more details on how the women’s and men’s races played out. The start of the 2023 Transgrancanaria Classic 128k. Photo: Transgrancanaria/Jordi Saragossa While she didn’t lead from the very start, this was yet another dominating performance from the U.S.’sCourtney Dauwalterafter winning this year’s Transgrancanaria Classic 128k by nearly two hours over the next woman. Spain’sClaudia Trempsinstead set the pace through Tenoya at 11k, whileJazmine Lowtherof Canada took over the women’s lead before Arucas at 19k. However, at both points, Dauwalter was just a minute off the lead, and she took a lead that she’d never relinquish on the climbing-heavy stretch on the way to Teror at 31k. Her three-minute lead at Teror grew to 31 minutes by Artenara at 66k, just a bit over the midway point of the race. By the time she reached the finish in Maspalomas, she had an hour and 46 minute lead on the next woman. Along the way, Dauwalter unfailingly moved up in the overall standings, going from the mid-20s in the early going to the mid-teens at mid-race to seventh overall at the finish.

Photo: Transgrancanaria/Jordi Saragossa Behind Dauwalter, a dynamic race emerged for second, and it was one that would last all the way to the finish line. At Arucas, 19k in, Lowther ran in second less than a minute ahead of Tremps before building a three-minute advantage on Tremps at Teror. Both runners were back together again at Fontanales (43k) and essentially together at El Hornillo (53k). From there, Lowther built margins of two minutes at Artenara (66k) and then 10 minutes at Tejada (78k). Things would stay dynamic because, after that, Tremps closed that to less than seven minutes at Garañon (90k). Then Lowther started rebuilding that gap to 12 minutes at Tunte (102k) and almost 17 minutes at Ayaguares 114k) … but Tremps more than cut that gap in half in the final 14k to the finish, with Lowther taking second by just under seven minutes and Tremps coming home in third. Phew, talk about some great push and pull between Lowther and Tremps for the women’s podium positions. Katharina Hartmuthof Germany didn’t go out with the eventual women’s podium. She was already five minutes behind Tremps at the first aid station and 10 to 15 minutes behind her for much of the race, being only 12 minutes behind the Spaniard at Tejada. While Hartmuth kept moving up in the overall field, Tremps kept growing her lead over the German over the race’s final 50k, with Hartmuth finishing fourth woman. Belgium’sDominique Van Mechgelen, who lives on Gran Canaria, was with Hartmuth at the first checkpoint 11k in but slowly lost ground to the German, falling as far back as 53 minutes behind her at Garañon, before eventually taking the fifth women’s position, 44 minutes behind Hartmuth.

Photo: Transgrancanaria/Jordi Saragossa While most of the women in the top 10 at the race’s first checkpoint at 11k ended up in the top 10, that was NOT the case in the men’s race. Wow. Of the 14 men to be within about two minutes of the lead at 11k, six would go on to drop out, including the top three at that point:Abel Carretero(Spain),Jia-Sheng Shen(China), andFotios Zisimopoulus(Greece). Now, the guy in fourth at that very early interval – Spain’sAndreu Simon– well, you’ll continue hearing about him. He, countryman and past Transgrancanaria champPau Capell, and Romania’sRaul Butaciwere all within a minute of the lead, with France’sArthur Joyeux-Bouillon, Switzerland’sJonas Russi, the U.S.’sTyler Green, and Romania’sIonel Manolerounding out the top 10 in the early going. By 30k at Teror, Zisimopoulus, Carretero, Simon, Butaci, and Shen were all still within roughly a minute of the lead, with Capell,Mario Olmedo(Spain),Miguel Arsénio(Portugal), Green, and Russi all between three and five minutes off the front. Things were much the same at Fontanales (43k), with the same top five all within just over a minute and, really, all together except Butaci a bit over a minute back, and that next group of Arsénio, Green, Capell, and Olmedo having condensed at just over five minutes off the lead.

Photo: Transgrancanaria/Jordi Saragossa Just 10k later at El Hornillo, Butaci shot into the lead, with Carretero, Shen, and Simon chasing 30 seconds back and Zisimopoulus being dropped three minutes off the front. The chase group of Olmedo, Arsénio, Green, and Capell were now eight to nine minutes back. Butaci continued to push the pace to Artenara, putting an 80-second gap on Simon, 3.5 minutes on Carretero, and 5.5 minutes on Shen, while Zisimopoulus was about to get caught by the chase group led by Green and Capell around 11 minutes off the lead. And then, not long after the sun came up, the race blew up. Simon took the lead on the way to Tejeda (78k) and put 2.5 minutes on Butaci before the aid station with Carretero just 3.5 minutes back, but Carretero would withdraw from the race there. Ten minutes off the lead, Arsénio was clear in fourth, with Green, Shen, Manole, and Capell in fifth through eighth at 12 to 14 minutes back, with Zisimopoulus and Olmedo 19 and 23 minutes back. However, both Shen and Olmedo would also drop in Tejeda. Moving to Tunte at 102k, the men’s race would continue to see more post-dawn carnage, with Manole (who was fifth upon arrival at Tunte) and Olmedo both withdrawing there. With those drops, Simon lead the race by 4.5 minutes over Arsénio. Butaci and Green sat 13.5 and 16.5 minutes off the lead in third and fourth. And Capell had just over a minute lead onJoaquin Lopezof Ecuador for fifth. Miguel Arsénio running in the high country of Gran Canaria as day comes to the 2023 Transgrancanaria Classic 128k.

Andreu Simon would go on to win with that same five-minute lead over Miguel Arsénio. While those two guys were flying, Raul Butaci was pulling his parachute. Tyler Green flew past him on the way to Ayaguares before taking third some 20 minutes out of second, but nine minutes clear of Butaci in fourth. Meanwhile, Pau Capell and Joaquin Lopez came into Ayaguares neck-and-neck, but Capell’s experience paid off, with him edging out the Ecuadorian by eight minutes over the final 14k to take fifth.

2023 Black Canyon 100k Results: Anthony Costales and Keely Henninger Lead Record-Breaking Day,"The 2023Black Canyon 100kkicked off in a chilly 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and while the competition in both the men’s and women’s races was hot and heavy, the temperatures remained a little lower than in previous years. This surely contributed to the fastest-ever Black Canyon 100k, which saw new course records set by bothAnthony CostalesandKeely Henninger. Three men finished underSage Canaday’srespected 2016 course record, and the first two women both came in underBrittany Peterson’s2021 record, which was indicative of the depth of the field battling it out forWestern States 100Golden Tickets. The Black Canyon 100k begins in Mayer, Arizona, and takes in 5,100 feet of climb and 7,000 feet of downhill on generally dry desert trails to finish at the Emery Henderson Trailhead outside of Phoenix. The start of the 2023 Black Canyon 100k. All photos: Jesse Ellis/@letswanderphotography Anthony Costalesset a 19-minute course record, finishing in 7:33. Costales placed fifth at the Black Canyon 100k last year after a difficult day and said in his finish line interview, “Last year after finishing, I did not think I was coming back. I was like, ‘I do not want to do that again!’” He said he was drawn back by the standard of competition he saw appear on the entrants list, particularly when he sawTom Evans(U.K.) had signed up and said, “I was really excited to go and race against one of the world’s best.” Cole Watsonwas the early race leader, with Evans the first to make a counterattack. Social media indicates that Evans led the race into the Black Canyon City aid station at mile 37.5, but Costales emerged from the aid station in first place, having patiently moved up through the field. Costales was more than five minutes clear of Evans by Doe Springs, mile 58.6, having extended the gap by a minute from the previous aid station.Janosch Kowalczyk(Germany) was now just two minutes back from Evans and applying pressure, having gained four minutes on Evans in the previous seven miles. Anthony Costales (right) on his way to winning the 2023 Black Canyon 100k. Costales seemed to gain momentum as he powered the home stretch to finish in a record-breaking 7:33. Evans came in second in 7:37, still 15 minutes under Canaday’s course record, with Kowalczyk third in 7:40. Cole Watson made it four men under eight hours, finishing in 7:59. Noah Dusseauwas the fifth man home, just a few minutes later, in 8:02. Costales tentatively accepted his Golden Ticket, and with Evans already having secured a place at this year’s edition of the Western States 100, the second men’s Golden Ticket fell to Kowalczyk. Full results. Triathlete and track cyclistHeather Jacksonis very new to the trail running world, but a lack of experience didn’t show as she was the early pacesetter in a very fast and close women’s race. She narrowly ledIda Nilsson(Sweden, lives in Norway) in second andKeely Henningerin third at mile 31. The top three women came into the Table Mesa aid station at mile 51 within seconds of one another — this time Henninger leading, followed immediately by Jackson, with Nilsson just seconds behind. Henninger cooled off with some ice and was out first, followed by Nilsson, then Jackson. All three were ahead of course-record pace. At Doe Springs, mile 58.6, Henninger and Jackson were just 14 seconds apart at the front, but Henninger managed to pull away in the closing miles and cruised home in 8:45, taking three minutes off Brittany Peterson’s 2021 course record and claiming the first women’s Golden Ticket. Henninger said at the finish, “That race was awesome, and I knew the course super well, and I knew what I could sustain.” Keely Henninger (in red), the 2023 Black Canyon 100k women’s winner. Heather Jackson, in her second trail race ever, came in second in 8:47, also under Peterson’s course record.Meghan Morganclosed out the podium in 8:53. Anna Kaciustook the women’s fourth position, and Nilsson ultimately arrived to the finish in fifth place. As Jackson already has a spot for the 2023 Western States 100, the second Golden Ticket fell to Morgan, who accepted it decisively.

2023 Tarawera by UTMB 102k Results: Kiwis Nancy Jiang and Daniel Jones Victorious,"They say that neither rain nor shine will stop the mail carriers of the world from delivering their mail, and the same can be said for ultrarunners. While a significant storm about a week before the 2023Tarawera by UTMB 102krace weekend caused a landslide and other issues around the remote course based in the city of Rotorua, on the North Island of New Zealand, the race organization rerouted the course last minute and the show went on. The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on Tarawera for the last few years, with the 2021 event held for local runners only due to the country’s borders being closed, and the 2022 event canceled due to a country-wide outbreak. For 2023, New Zealand’s borders are reopened and Tarawera once again welcomed runners from far and wide. While going on a decade, the 100-kilometer race at Tarawera has attracted international talent, it’s also been a Western States 100 Golden Ticket Race for a few years, wherein for this year two women and two men are awarded entry to the 2023 Western States 100. All of these variables collided early Saturday morning, February 11, as 776 runners streamed off an improvised starting line on the northern shores of Lake Okataina, east of Rotorua, heading for the Rotorua finish line. Some 100 kilometers of racing later, beginning in cool, humid weather and running through warm and still humid weather with peeks of sun through a decent cloud bank all day, it was the national talent that ran best. New Zealand’sNancy Jiangtopped the women’s race andDaniel Jonestook home the men’s win. Read on for more details about both races. Scenery on the 2023 Tarawera 102k course. Photo: Tim Bardsley-Smith If the 2023 Tarawera 102k women’s race is a predictor of what this year is going to look like for women’s trail ultrarunning, we all had better pay attention. It was the women’s race that stayed competitive wire-to-wire, with the top five women finishing within 12 minutes of championNancy Jiangof New Zealand. This marks the closest women’s race in the decade-plus of Tarawera 102k history — by a long way. The U.S.’sAmanda Bashamwas the early race leader, pushing what other women called a hot early pace. She led for roughly the race’s first third before slowing to an ultimate eighth place. Then, before the race’s marathon mark,Stephanie Austonof Australia assumed the race lead. But a passel of women stayed close all day. At the final checkpoint, around six kilometers from the finish, Jiang and Auston ran together, a couple of meters separating them, with Jiang at the helm. When Jiang crossed the line in victory, only 90 seconds of daylight separated her and second-place Auston. Jiang is a multi-time champion of New Zealand’s iconic Kepler Challenge, and in 2022 she was 22nd at the CCC in France. Preceding Auston’s second place at the Tarawera 102k by less than two months was a victory at the 2022 Ultra-Trail Kosciuszko by UTMB 100k in her home country. Spain’sAroa Siospent the entire race running within the women’s top five. Vacillating all race between second and fifth positions, Sio crossed the line in third place and just about three minutes behind second. Sio appears primed for another big year, following up on her strong 2022, which included takingthird at the Canyons by UTMB 100k, 12th at the Western States 100, and eighth at UTMB. Following the women’s podium only five minutes later was fourth placeAnna McKennaof Australia, and China’sFu-Zhao Xiangin fifth, the pair only separated by another two minutes. At the time of this article’s publishing, it was not publicly known who (if anyone) in the women’s race has yet accepted the Western States 100 Golden Tickets. Two are given out, runners have a couple of weeks to decide if they’d like to accept them, and the tickets roll down as far as fifth place as needed. Among the top five women, no woman already has a Western States 100 entry by other means. Nancy Jiang, 2023 Tarawera 102k champion. Photo: Graeme Murray Full results. I was really rooting for New Zealand’sDaniel Jonesto get a Western States 100 Golden Ticket, as he’s been trying for four races to earn one. Jones intended to race the 2022 Tarawera 102k, but it was canceled last minute due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its Golden Tickets were doled out at other events in the series. Then, a few months later, in April of 2022, he took 10th in a tough day at the Canyons by UTMB 100k, another Golden Ticket Race for which he traveled to the U.S. to participate in. After not earning a ticket there, he stayed on in the U.S. to attempt another shot at a ticket, mistaking the 2022 Lake Sonoma 100k for a Golden Ticket Race. He won the race, but heartbreakingly learned after the fact that it wasn’t part of the series — in all fairness the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile was a Golden Ticket Race for many years — and went home without that Golden Ticket. All this is to say that when the men’s race fired off in the 2023 Tarawera 102k, I couldn’t help but really want Jones to earn one of those tickets. But some 102 kilometers worth of earning he would have to do. Sam McCutcheon, who is from New Zealand, but who lives in the U.K., was the race’s early pacesetter. Like Amanda Basham on the women’s side, McCutcheon largely set the pace for the men through the event’s first third. However, there were always other guys right there, running within seconds of the lead. After the 38k aid station, Jones and the U.S.’sHayden Hawksshook free of McCutcheon as well as the rest of the men’s field, settling into what looked like roughly a shared leadership of the pole position. According to the pair, they are friends and have been training partners over the last year both when Jones traveled to the U.S. and when Hawks traveled to New Zealand. There was some leapfrogging, we believe, before Jones was able to shake free of Hawks too, to lead the race solo. At the penultimate aid station, 87k into the race, Jones led solo with a five-minute gap on Hawks, which he extended to more than 14 minutes by the finish line. We understand that Jones is eagerly accepting his Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Hawks crossed the line in second, saying afterward on social media that he’d run his own best race and was happy with his performance. Hawks already has an entry to the Western States 100 courtesy of asecond place there last year, which means the second Golden Ticket rolls down the finisher’s list. Ryan Montgomeryfrom the U.S. raced smart, shadowing those pressing at the front but setting their own sustainable pace. That meant running in the back half of the top 10 for the race’s first third, moving up to podium position around the close of the race’s second third, and holding that spot through the finish line, some 40-plus minutes behind the leader. Montgomery, who identifies as nonbinary but who raced in the men’s race, wrote on social media that they are excited about earning that Western States 100 Golden Ticket. McCutcheon ultimately rolled across the line in fourth place, and Australia’sRhett Gipsontook fifth. Daniel Jones, 2023 Tarawera 102k champion. Photo: Graeme Murray Full results. The Tarawera by UTMB event held races over three other distances, including 21k, 50k, and 100 miles.

"2023 Winter Spine Race Results: Racers Endure Low Visibility, High Winds, and Waist-Deep Snow","The 2023Spine Racewinter edition saw a record number of participants and a stacked field of competitors on the course, includingEoin Keith(Ireland),Elaine Bisson(U.K.),Damian Hall(U.K.),Kim Collison(U.K.),Eugeni Rosello(Spain),Doug Zinis(U.K.),James Leavensley(U.K.),Ellie Eccles(U.K.), andSharon Gayter(U.K.). In all, 500 racers from 22 countries showed up across the event’s five races. The  Spine Race is designed to be grueling, and this year’s British winter didn’t disappoint. Blizzards, 70-mile-per-hour winds, waist-deep snow, and low overnight temperatures all took their toll on race participants. Nevertheless, stiff competition fueled the runners, and several of the event’s races saw course records smashed by minutes and even hours. “Britain’s Most Brutal” event takes place along the 268-milePennine Way National Trail, which stretches from the Peak District in England to the Scottish borders. Participants run unsupported: they carry all their supplies (food, sleep system, clothing, and medical supplies), and no pacers are allowed. Additionally, the route isn’t marked, and racers navigate the trail on their own. As we’ll see, this fact played heavily into this year’s final results. The weeklong event and its five races extend for 2023 from January 15 to January 22. In this article, we share highlights from four of the event’s five races: A finisher of one of the races in the Spine Race winter edition crosses the line with the help of two young supporters. Photo: @willbaldlygo The titular event, which travels all 268 miles of the Pennine Way, was full of drama asJack ScottandDamian Hallbattled for first place in the men’s race. It came down to the wire on the last day, with the two racers neck and neck as they crossed the finish line. Unfortunately for Scott, a navigational error in the dead of the night led to a 48-minute time penalty when he strayed off course. Damian Hall takes victory in the 2023 Spine Race winter edition men’s race.

Hall took the top honors in 84 hours,  36 minutes, and 24 seconds, and Scott’s second-place finish clocked 85:16:24 once his penalty time was added. Jack Scott, the 2023 Spine Race winter edition second-place man. Photo: @wild_aperture This year’s race represents the fourth attempt for Hall. The accomplished runner, who also puts in behind-the-scenes work at the Spine Race, suffered an injury during last year’s race. “I wanted to come back and do better. It’s been an incredible race,” Hall shared. “I thought we were going to have a nice time running together,” Hall said in reference to the younger Jack Scott. “But every time I saw Jack, he seemed to keep pushing harder.” At 28, Scott’s just getting started. “Running has become something within me that I now can’t remove. I want to see how far and how fast I can run,” he told Spine Race representatives. The competition was certainly effective in pushing both runners to excellence. Their finish smashes the previous male course record, set by AmericanJohn Kelly, by almost three hours.Jasmin Parisstill holds the women’s and overall course record of 83:12:23.

"2023 Bandera 100k Results: A Record for Dauwalter, Colt Gallops Away","Hundreds of runners toed the line at the 2023Bandera 100kon Saturday, January 7, all vying for four total Golden Tickets to the 2023Western States 100. The top two men and women in the Texas race qualified for the seminal Western States 100 run. When the dust settled in Bandera today,Jeff ColtandJP Giblineked out a one-two on the men’s side andCourtney Dauwalterran away with the women’s race, setting a new course record. Early rain turned the Bandera course into sludge, then afternoon sunshine cooked it into a hard, hoof-printed jigsaw puzzle. The Bandera course is famously punishing: “Everything cuts, stings, or bites,” as race organizers say, and technical rock gardens proliferate.Joe “Stringbean” McConaughyunfortunately landed in the DNF bucket due to a rumored Achilles injury sustained in that rock. The start of the 2023 Bandera 100k. All photos: Jesse Ellis/@letswanderphotography Courtney Dauwalternot only dismantled the rest of the women’s field, but also ran the fastest Bandera 100k in women’s history.Stephanie Howeset the previous record in 2017 at 9:08; Dauwalter shattered it with an 8:59 finish. The Leadville, Colorado, legend didn’t falter down the stretch, running a strong final lap to seal the win and the record. In the finish corral, the famously candid Dauwalter asked Aravaipa Running livestream’s interviewer, “How are you?” Then she asked for a chair and a beer. An overjoyedNicole Bitterfollowed in second and eagerly claimed her Golden Ticket. Dauwalter also claimed her spot on the start line of the Western States 100.

Courtney Dauwalter, the 2023 Bandera 100k women’s winner. Full results. ForJeff Colt, the win in 8:23 was especially welcome. He’d taken third in two previous Bandera 100k’s but never topped the podium before Saturday. Colt also earned his way back to the Western States 100 after a disappointing outcome in 2022 — he took 11th at that race — but at the time of writing, he was still undecided about whether or not to accept the Golden Ticket. JP Giblinfollowed, a strong second in 8:29, and accepted his Golden Ticket with no indecision. Twenty-nine-year-oldCanyon Woodwardcrossed the line in third. Woodward didn’t start the 2023 Bandera 100k as a favorite by any means, but led a substantial amount of the race and hung with the overall leaders throughout. Elsewhere, 26-year-oldChris Myerstook fourth in his first-ever official 100k. Myers sat poised for a podium late in the game, but Woodward gained precious seconds on him with just several miles to go, and didn’t give them up.Ryan Atkinsof obstacle course racing fame has put his stamp on American ultrarunning with his fifth place.

2023 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all the runners who were chosen for the 2023Hardrock 100! The Hardrock 100 is a 100-mile race bearing 33,000 feet of climbing that goes in a loop around Colorado’s gorgeous San Juan Mountains, starting and finishing in the small town of Silverton. The course regularly visits altitudes above 13,000 feet and boasts several climbs exceeding 4,000 vertical feet. The event alternates directions on its loop each year, with the 2023 event heading in the counterclockwise direction. The Hardrock 100 has one of the most difficult lotteries to enter the run — in part because the qualifying races which you have to finish in order to enter the event lotto themselves are all notoriously challenging, and in part because, for this year, some 2,414 people vied for the event’s 146 spots. In this article, we attempt to distill the complicated lotto process and highlight those runners who we expect will make a speedy lap around the San Juans at the front of those 146 very lucky participants. Sunrise on Grant-Swamp Pass during the 2017 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Vince Heyd The Hardrock 100 lottery is complicated, so setting the stage with the parameters of this year’s lotto gives context for the rest of this article. The 2023 Hardrock 100 will start 146 runners. As mentioned at the outset of this article, 2,414 people applied for the lottery. This is significantly up from the 2022 lotto which had 1,916 applicants. The 2023 lottery was divided into two categories, the Never Finished and Finished divisions: For 2023, the event chose 73 runners from each category. For the 2022 event and beyond, the organization adopted a gender policy to help account for the historic underrepresentation of women in the Hardrock 100. The policy states that the event will start at least the percentage of women who apply for the lotto. For 2023, 19.7% of the lotto applicants were women, so 29 of the 146 starters will be women for 2023. The organization allotted 18 of those spots to the Never Finished category and nine of those spots to the Finished category. Historically, several runners are chosen ahead of time by the run director,Dale Garland, and announced among the names chosen in the lottery. The run organization indicated Garland chose six runners for 2023, and those entries were applied to their respective categories. Returning champions are given entrance to the event. The 2022 women’s championCourtney Dauwalterhas accepted that entry, while 2022 men’s champKilian Jornetdeclined it. Dauwalter’s entry comes from the Finished category. There are four runners whose 2022 entries were deferred to 2023, and whose entries were applied to their respective categories. All told, it looks like the lotto selected 135 runners for 2023, with the 11 remaining entrants Dale’s picks, the reigning women’s champion, and the 2022 deferments. The chances of a runner gaining entry to Hardrock depend upon which division of the lotto they are in and how many tickets they have in the lotto. TheHardrock 100 website’s lottery pageexplains the details and nuances, but in short, tickets are gained through previous finishes as well as volunteer service to the organization. In addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into four division- and gender-specific waitlists. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is competitive in nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit upon which the Hardrock 100 prides itself. In the rest of this article, we document the women and men who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist with a reasonable chance to get in. Bogie Dumitrescu after finishing the 2015 Hardrock 100 one second before the 48-hour cutoff. Photo: Blake Wood As mentioned above, just about the only way to gain automatic entry to the Hardrock 100 is by winning. The 2022 women’s champion Courtney Dauwalterwill be back to defend her title.

2022 Trail World Championships 80k Results: Peterman and L’Hirondel Win,"This year’s much anticipatedTrail World Championships, now part of the combinedWorld Mountain and Trail Running Championships, was very different from the usual European courses the event tends to visit. The course saw some of the world’s best battling it out over 78 kilometers of Thailand jungle, on a three-looped course taking in 4,807 meters (15,771 feet) of climbing and descending in the Doi Suthep-Pui National Park on the outskirts of Chiang Mai on Saturday, November 5. The favorites for the individual win were France’sBlandine L’Hirondel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), reigning Trail World Champion and this year’s CCC winner, for the women’s race; and the U.S.’sAdam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), making his international debut and coming off a win at Western States 100, on the men’s side. There was also a team race in store, with strong contingents from France, Italy, Poland, and the U.S., to name but a few. While the wins in the individual races went along predicted lines, there were some surprises along the way, including an off-the-charts comeback performance from Sweden’sIda Nilsson(post-race interview) in second place in the women’s race, who made L’Hirondel work very hard for the win. On the men’s side, France’sNicolas Martin’s(post-race interview) second place was especially impressive, his sixth time representing his country at this event shining through via his steady performance on a pressure-filled day. The 80k race wasn’t the only one run the past few days.

It was Nilsson who made the first move, and by 30k in she had established a lead. L’Hirondel pulled away from the others in second, just a minute back from Nilsson, leaving a sizeable gap to the rest of the field. A long game of cat and mouse ensued between the two leaders, with L’Hirondel closing the gap to just 45 seconds at the 50k mark, but Nilsson pulling away again — coming through 60k more than three minutes ahead of the favorite, L’Hirondel, and looking the stronger of the two. The two still maintained a gap of more than 13 minutes to Spain’sGemma Arenas(post-race interview), who had moved into third at point. Gemma Arenas of Spain on her way to finishing third at the 2022 Trail World Championships 80k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks L’Hirondel had spoken about the course in herpre-race interviewand its challenging last section, and said that she planned to run prudently to hold something for the end. She was as good as her word, as on the last major climb — some 1,000 meters of ascent in 6k, from Huay Tung Tao up to the village of Ban Khun Chiang Khian — she not only passed but pulled seven minutes ahead of her rival. Nilsson, now in second at 66k, was visibly working but still moving at a great pace and undeterred. Even more, she was 14 minutes clear of Arenas in third as she powered toward the finish. L’Hirondel continued to pull away on the last stretch to the finish, a 12k descent, and romped home in a time of 8:22, to continue her reign as 80k Trail World Champion. L’Hirondel is more known for the marathon to 50k distance. She holds the course record for the 55k OCC, which she set last year, and herprevious Trail World Championships win in 2019was over the shorter 44k distance. This year she stepped up to the 100k distance with a win at CCC, and today she has once again demonstrated her versatility with a win in this hot and humid 80k jungle race.

Her long career has included wins at The North Face 50 Mile in 2016 and 2017, the Zegama Marathon in 2018, and the Marathon du Mont Blanc in 2016. She has demonstrated today that there is still a lot more to come. Ida Nilsson is really, really happy with second place at the 2022 Trail World Championships 80k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Gemma Arenas in third was rock solid all day. She came through 30k in fourth, about a minute and a half back from Emma Pooley. She moved into podium position shortly thereafter and maintained it all day — never quite closing the gap on the leaders, but not falling back either — and finished in a time of 8:46. Hungary’sEszter Csillagdid what she does best, starting calmly and expertly moving up through the field all day. She finished fourth, just three minutes back from Arenas in 8:49, in a similar manner to her fifth-place finish at this year’s UTMB. Germany’sRosanna Buchauerwas a minute and a half back in fifth, and France’sAudrey TanguyandMarion Delespierrefinished together in sixth and seventh to seal the women’s team gold for France.

By 8k into the race, alongside Italy’sAndreas Reiterer(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), he was already up front and setting the pace. By the 30k mark, Peterman was discernibly in front but still looked very calm and controlled — keeping just a few seconds clear of France’sNicolas Martin(post-race interview), who had moved into second place. Just a minute back from the leaders, Reiterer and Spain’sAritz Egearan together in third.

By 60k, Reiterer had pulled away from Egea and was putting the pressure on Martin to hold on to second. Andreas Reiterer ran an aggressive but smart race to take third at the 2022 Trail World Championships 80k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks When Peterman reached the top of the third ascent, at 66k, he was 10 minutes ahead of Martin in second but visibly working hard against the heat. His downhill legs clearly had some muscle memory from the Western States 100 this summer, as he put another three minutes on the chaser in the last crushing descent to the finish, crossing the line as 80k Trail World Champion in a time of 7:15. He adds this latest achievement to an already astonishing early career in ultrarunning. He has thus far won all six of his six ultramarathon starts — including last year’s Speedgoat by UTMB 50k and JFK 50 Mile and this year’s Chuckanut 50k, Canyons by UTMB 100k,and Western States 100.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Nicolas Martin, who at times had looked under pressure to hold on to second, had a great last loop and finished eight minutes clear of Andreas Reiterer in 7:28. This was Martin’s sixth Trail World Championships, and he matched his previous best result, asecond-place finish in 2016. Reiterer, who is a relative newcomer to international trail racing, crossed the line in third in 7:36. Spain’sJosé Fernandezand Aritz Egea came in fourth and fifth, helping to seal Spain’s third-place team result. France took silver in the team competition, withThibaut Garrivier(sixth) andPaul Mathou(10th) joining teammate Nicolas Martin in the top 10. In what has to be the biggest upset of the weekend of racing so far, Team USA took men’s team gold, beating out perpetual team stars France and Spain, along with several other great teams on the day.

2022 Trail World Championships 40k Results: Angermund and Dragomir Win Gold,"The fireworks from the opening ceremony gave way to fireworks on the jungle- and temple-lined trail. Saturday’s 40-kilometerTrail World Championshipsrace — just a smidge less than the marathon distance — ran as a bit of a figure of eight with two major climbs.

"2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile Results: Lockwood, Hughes Hop Away With Wins","The 2022Run Rabbit Run 100 Milegot underway Friday, September 16. The “hares and tortoises,” as race organizers playfully frame competitors, started from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, at noon and 8 a.m. local time, respectively. They then clambered through the day, night, and day again over an exhaustive roundtrip through the mountain bike trails and dirt roads encircling the town. The circuit is nothing if not a rugged one: the race website says an entire eight miles of it are paved, 86 are trails, and the remainder consist of “rough jeep roads.” Over “about 101.5 miles,” runners ascend some 20,391 feet — then descend it, of course. This year, the weather featured heavily, with waves of rain heavily wetting the course, making it, at times, a humorous slip-and-slide. For the hares, mainly consisting of highly attuned professionals, there was a lot at stake in the high-altitude race. Prize purses totaled $75,000, distributed equally between both the top-seven men and women. Each winner snagged $15,000, what together represent one of the highest prize purses in ultrarunning. Men’s leaders began to trickle into the finish line just before dawn on Saturday, September 17, with the top women a few hours behind. In the men’s competition,Richard Lockwoodprevailed, breaking away from the rest of the men at a little over halfway, and never failing to relinquish his lead at any timed checkpoint overArlen Glickin second place. On the women’s side,Annie Hughestailed her competitors early before taking the lead about a third of the way through the race, methodically adding time on her chasers, and posting a decisive victory. The start of the 2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile. All photos: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Richard Lockwoodnever wavered in the punishing 100 miler, at times appearing obstinate in his determination to lead Glick. At Long Lake, 24.3 miles in, the two ran together about a half minute off the lead pace and 10 seconds apart. Six miles later at Summit Lake, they were still in the thick of it together. Richard Lockwood, 2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile champion. But it wasAvery Collinswho got off to a hot start and led the field through about the halfway point. By Dry Lake at mile 44.5, he’d built his lead on the field to over eight minutes. However, by 64 miles into the race, Lockwood was in lockstep with Collins, and would take over the lead and run away with things. And by the second Long Lake timing point at 89 miles, Lockwood led by what might as well have been light years. No one ran within an hour of his pace by the finish line. Nick Elson(Canada) did lead Glick late, by up to 79 seconds at the mile 95.8 mark, but couldn’t hang on for the rousing final descent and finished third. Glick turned around hispodium finish at the Western States 100earlier this year, and Elson debuted well in his first 100 miler. Samuel Collinstook fourth, and the other Collins, the early leader Avery, finished in fifth position. Full results. Arlen Glick (left) would take second at the 2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile. As has become the case in every race she starts, this was theAnnie Hughesshow. Early on, Hughes let other women take the race out, staying in contact with the front of the pack before taking over the lead by one third of the way through. Her smart racing meant that, aid station by aid station, she grew her lead, splitting each section faster than the rest of the field. By the finish line, she was some 100-plus-minutes clear of any other woman. This makes a trio of big victories in competitive events in 2022 for Hughes, withwins at the Cocodona 250 Mileand the High Lonesome 100 Mile in addition to here. Annie Hughes, 2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile champion. The rest of the top women’s field highlighted what’s so exciting about women’s ultrarunning right now, some six or seven women running nearly together in a tight pack well clear of the halfway mark. In that group included eventual top-five finishersTara Dower,Rachel Lemcke,Kasey Nobert, andMary Baughmanwho were just minutes apart for so long. By the time the women returned to the start-finish line, the race for the top spots was still incredibly close, with second- and third-place Dower and Baughman under three minutes apart, and fifth- and sixth-place Lemcke andSarah Boughnerjust 21 seconds apart. Once a phenomenon only seen in much shorter races, the down-to-the-wire duels are now a thing of 100-mile mountain ultrarunning. Full results.

"2022 Pikes Peak Ascent Results: Brinkman, Bonnet Prevail","The 2022Pikes Peak Ascentkicked off today at 7 a.m. local time. Toeing the start line on the streets of Manitou Springs, Colorado, amounts to a singular moment for the many who join the deeply competitive field each year. The objective is straightforward but daunting: climb the requisite 7,815 feet to the finish line just below the Pikes Peak summit at 14,050 feet faster than everyone else.The 13.32-mile courseup the well-known Barr Trail averages —averages— an 11% grade. And that’s the way it’s been for 66 years. As part of this year’s Golden Trail World Series (GTWS), this edition of the Ascent saw a stacked field take off under an unobstructed sun and cool temperatures. While thePikes Peak Marathonhas previously been featured in the GTWS, the switch was made to the shorter race this year to allow competitors better race again at the next GTWS race at theFlagstaff Sky Peaksin Arizona next weekend. A wrinkle in the Pikes Peak Ascent prize purse: anyone who clocks a faster time than one the organizers set before the race banks an extra $10,000. This year’s times to beat were two hours even for men, and 2:21 for women. Briefly, it looked likeRémi Bonnethad a shot — but in the end, neither he nor women’s race winnerNienke Brinkmanclaimed it.

Eight men passed the trailside marker, “1/2 way to Heaven,” shortly before Barr Camp within roughly three and a half minutes. Gray dogged Bonnet, and some live feed trackers thought he could execute a pass near race end. But in the end, nobody could catch Bonnet, who won with a 2:07:02. Drama did ensue behind Bonnet, asDaniel Osanzovertook Gray late and then gained some distance on the 38-year-old.

2022 IAU 100k World Championships Results: Hot and Okayama Prevail,"For the first time since 2018, runners lined up for the 2022IAU 100k World Championships. This year’s edition, hosted by the town of Bernau, Germany, just northeast of Berlin, saw athletes from 42 countries tackle the flat-and-fast course on the wide Wandlitzer Chaussee, a wind-protected path through the neighboring forests. All of the race festivities centered around the city’s Bernau Bauhaus monument, with runners coming back through the start and finish line a total of 14 times. Runners started out with a quick 2.5-kilometer opening lap before embarking on 13 laps of a triple out-and-back, 7.5k course with two tight 180-degree hairpin turns and one more gradual turn through the start/finish area. The unique format of this race allowed competitors to see each other potentially up to three times per lap. With minimal elevation gain on the course, it was a perfect setup to see records being broken. In the women’s field, the favorites includedCamille ChaigneauandFloriane Hot, both of France. For the men, it seemed that the Japanese team would be dominant with previous 100-kilometer world record holderNao Kazamiamong the field. It was just a matter of how many team members the Japanese contingent could place on the podium, and who would be the one to try to knock them off. In the 100-strong women’s field, it was the French team to watch with the top duo ofCamille ChaigneauandFloriane Hot. As the 2022 French 100-kilometer national champion, Hot had high ambitions for the race. It was a fast start at the front of the field for Chaigneau, who quickly showed her intentions of taking control of the race. Just a little over halfway, at 55 kilometers, she led the field with a minute gap over Finland’sSatu Lipiäinen.Courtney Olsenof the USA,Caitriona Jenningsof Ireland, andFloriane Hotof France all sat in the top five biding their time. After 70 kilometers, the top five stayed nearly the same, with only Olsen slipping two positions down the leaderboard to fifth. The gaps remained small between the top five and the order unchanged for the next 10 kilometers before Hot surged to the lead at 80 kilometers, quickly putting a 36-second gap on teammate Chaigneau. A fading Chaigneau couldn’t hold on to the relentless pace over the closing kilometers, eventually losing nearly a minute and a half to Hot but retaining her second position. Jennings made a valiant attempt to catch Chaigneau, but was only able to get within 45 seconds, and Olsen and Lipiäinen raced hard to the end, finishing within eight seconds of each other for fourth and fifth. Hot’s time of 7:04:03 bested her previous 100-kilometer personal record of 7:42 by a lot and was a European record for the distance. Jennings’s third-place finish was a world record in the women’s 40 to 49 age group. In the women’s team race, Team USA took home gold, with France and Japan earning silver and bronze, respectively. The top-three individual finishers of each team scored for the team event. Team USA was led by Olsen’s fourth-place finish,Anna Kacius’sseventh place, andNicole Monette’s11th place.

All photos: Dinko Bažulić/Croatian ultra running team Full results. All eyes were on the Japanese team heading into the event. With a strong four-man roster that includedNao Kazami, the previous world-record holder for the 100-kilometer distance, there was talk of a Japanese podium sweep. But with 133 runners starting, there were sure to be plenty of others to challenge the team’s dominance. But it was a young 24-year-old French runner,Guillaume Ruel,setting to pace straight out the gap, and he maintained the lead until about 75 kilometers into the race. At that point, Japan’sHarukiOkayamamoved into pole position, being tailed closely by Ruel.Jumpei Yamaguchikept the gap close in third while Kazami in fourth started to fade back. The two leaders would continue to run within a few minutes of each other through 85 kilometers with Yamaguchi sitting in third andPiet Wiersmafrom The Netherlands working his way into fourth. As the kilometers wound down, Yamaguchi made a strong surge into second place, passing a fading Ruel in the final minutes. By the end, Wieisma and Norway’sSebastian Conrad Håkanssonwould also pass Ruel to place third and fourth with Ruel holding onto fifth. Okayama’s winning time of 6:12:10 was over four minutes faster than his previous best of 6:16:44, and good enough to crown him the 2022 IAU 100k world champion. In the men’s team race, Team Japan took home gold, with France and South Africa respectively earning silver and bronze. Team Japan was led by first-place Okayama, second-place Yamaguchi, and sixth-place Kazami.

2022 UTMB Results: A Record for Jornet and a Runaway Win for Schide,"Thanks to HOKA for sponsoring iRunFar’s coverage of the 2022 UTMB. This year’sUTMBmen’s race was billed as a likely showdown between two of the greats in men’s ultrarunning,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) andKilian Jornet(post-race interview), with predictions that whoever came out ahead would also hold a new course record. And while it initially seemed that the race would play out as expected, with Walmsley and Jornet trading blows for the first 142 kilometers, it would beMathieu Blanchard(post-race interview) who made the final attempt to dethrone Jornet. But it was not to be, with Jornet breaking both previous course records, by a significant margin, in a time of 19:49:30. The women’s side of the 2022 UTMB had an openness that perhaps fans had not felt in years. With no previous champions or clear favorites on the starting line, instead, we all ruminated about the 10 or 12 women with the potential to win or challenge for it. Even then, we all also noticed the deepening women’s field year over year, with this one likely requiring getting to the finish line quicker than was previously normal to secure a top-10 finish. From the start line,Katie Schide(pre– andpost-race interviews) led aggressively, only relinquishing the lead for a handful of kilometers around daybreak during a rough patch, before getting her stomach under control and finishing with a time of 23:15:12 way in front of the rest of the field. Covering 171.5 kilometers (106.5 miles), the UTMB creates an aesthetic and rugged loop around Mont Blanc in the Alps. Starting and ending in Chamonix, France, before paying a visit to both Italy and Switzerland, the loop has some 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) of elevation gain and loss. Arguably the most competitive trail ultramarathon of the year, UTMB is an event to behold. The final and most prestigious race of the week-long UTMB Mont-Blanc festival, it reliably draws top talent and some of the biggest crowds in the sport. This year, 2,795 starters headed out from Chamonix at 6 p.m. on Friday, August 26, under cloudy skies and a sprinkle of rain, but with a forecast for potential rain and thunderstorms throughout the evening. The forecasted storms never really materialized, and runners enjoyed favorable weather throughout the race. Jornet and Schide took similar paths to the win, both starting out strong before fading in the middle of the race and then surging to the front when it really mattered. And both saw strong challenges from second-place finishers, Blanchard andMarianne Hogan(post-race interview). Several top runners would end up dropping out due to various ailments, including last year’s third-place womanMimmi Kotka(pre-race interview) and sixth-place manHannes Namberger(pre-race interview).

The start of the 2022 UTMB on Friday, August 26, 2022. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein As expected, the men took the race out fast from the start on the relatively flat roads and trails from Chamonix to the village of Les Houches. Spain’sPau Capell(pre-race interview), the 2019 UTMB winner, led a charging group through Les Houches, seven kilometers into the race, followed closely byMathieu Blanchard(post-race interview), a Frenchman living in Canada, andJia-Ju ZhaoandGuo-Min Deng, both of China. All the top contenders were in a massive chase pack, settling in for the long night and day ahead. It didn’t take long forJim Walmsley(pre-race interview) of the USA to make his intentions for this year’s race clear, coming into Saint-Gervais, at 20 kilometers into the race, in the lead, looking strong and relaxed.Kilian Jornet(post-race interview) and Capell were just seconds behind with Deng, Zhao, and AmericanZach Miller(post-race interview) making up a chase group half a minute in arrears. They were followed by FrenchmanGermain Grangier, Blanchard, FrenchmanThibaut Garrivier, andYan-Qiao Yunof China. Unsurprisingly, by Les Contamines, 31 kilometers into the race, it was shaping up to be a showdown between Walmsley and Jornet. They came into the aid station together looking relaxed, Walmsley taking the time to high-five fans, and were shortly on their way into the night together. Capell and Miller came in just 30 seconds back, and Grangier rounded out the top five, just a minute behind them. A notable withdrawal around this time due to physical issues is last year’s second-place finisher, FrenchmanAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-race interview). Climbing over the high Col du Bonhomme, 43 kilometers in, Walmsley, Miller, Jornet, andTom Evans(pre-andpost-race interviews) of the U.K. shared the lead. With 1,160 meters (3,800 feet) of climbing down just on this one climb, everyone in the group looked relaxed and was moving well. Capell was just 90 seconds back, trying not to let the elastic to the front group snap in the dark of the night on the run over to Col du Bonhomme before the long descent into the remote French outpost of Les Chapieux. The U.K.’s Tom Evans on his way to the 2022 UTMB start line. He would eventually place third. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein The four leaders stayed together down to Les Chapieux, 50 kilometers into the race, where last year’s winner, François D’Haene — not participating this year — was spectating and cheering on runners. Unfortunately, Capell had lost contact with the lead group over the previous section, coming into the aid station more than two minutes back. The rest of the top nine stayed relatively the same withErik Sorensonof the USA slotting in 10th for the first time. Coming into Lac Combal, 66 kilometers into the race, after crossing country borders into Italy and traversing the most remote part of the course, Walmsley and Jornet had only slightly pulled away, their gap to Miller and Evans hung at a tenuous minute. All four looked strong, but it seemed like pre-race predictions of a two-man showdown were about to be realized. Walmsley, with his arms and legs fully covered from the cold of the night but shirt front open, came into the town of Courmayeur, 80 kilometers in, solo and in the lead, but his gap on Jornet was just 80 seconds. Both men were moving well and left the aid station together after only a few minutes. It was a significant 12 minutes before Evans and Miller came through, staying in Courmayeur for under three minutes. Blanchard, looking more relaxed than any of the previous four, was also in and out of the aid station quickly, 18 minutes off the lead. Known for his slower starts and late race surges, Blanchard appeared to know exactly what he was doing. It was never a question of if Walmsley or Jornet would strike out on their own, it was just a matter of when. Walmsley was the first to throw down a serious acceleration, coming into Arnouvaz (97 kilometers) solo and with a 2.5-minute gap on Jornet. Both were in and out of the aid station quickly, looking strong and motivated. Blanchard also chose the trail between Courmayeur and Arnouvaz to make his move, coming into the Arnouvaz aid station in third, looking very controlled and 14 minutes behind the leaders. He was familiar with that position in the race, having finished third in UTMB in 2021. He was also familiar with the race tactic of starting slower, letting the leaders fight it out early and tire themselves out, and then moving up as the fast starters dropped back. It had brought him success the previous year, and he was seemingly employing the strategy again. Miller and Evans continued to run near each other, what Evans would later refer to as a “bromance” that lasted over half the race, and both looked like they had less spring in their step than the men ahead of them. Committed to making the move stick, Walmsley climbed the Grand Col Ferret at 102 kilometers with a strong powerhike and held a five-minute gap over Jornet. Seemingly unconcerned with his position, Jornet chatted in French with both spectators and volunteers before vanishing into the night. Moving faster and looking stronger over the col than the previous two men, Blanchard continued the chase in third 17 minutes back. Miller and Evans continued to work together to keep the gap manageable. The gap between Walmsley and Jornet stretched even further to 14 minutes by the sleepy Swiss village of La Fouly, 112 kilometers into the race. Both men were running under course-record pace, and both looked calm and collected. Still running strong into La Fouly, Blanchard kept the leaders within reach. But Walmsley was committed to stretching the elastic on the field as much as he could, coming through Champex-Lac at 125 kilometers with 13 hours and 40 minutes on the race clock, gaining even more time on the course record and moving strongly. It’s generally a bad idea to bet against Walmsley after he’s put his mind to something, and after a fifth-place finish in 2017 and DNF in 2018 and 2021 at UTMB, his commitment to the race and move to Europe to train on the trails seemed to be paying off. But Walmsley is also known for going out fast and strong, and it doesn’t always stick. Kilian Jornet, 2022 UTMB champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell One could argue that Jornet was just biding his time, letting Walmsley burn his matches out front. However, there were times around this point in the race when Jornet just plain looked like he was working, enough so that we all began to wonder if the GOAT of trail running would have a crack in his armor today. However, by Trient at 142 kilometers, Jornet had decided to make his move, coming into the aid station in the lead. But instead of seeing Walmsley behind him, it was a surging Blanchard, less than a minute back, that Jornet would have to now battle. It was a long 19 minutes before Walmsley would arrive, appearing to be in discomfort. The dynamic duo of Evans and Miller continued to run together, still holding the gap to the race leader at just over 30 minutes, as they had for much of the race. As the kilometers ticked down, it was indeed a showdown between two men, except it was Blanchard challenging Jornet, with both men coming into Vallorcine at 153 kilometers together, well ahead of the course-record pace. With Walmsley slowly losing time to the leaders but still in third, eyes moved to Evans who’d finally dropped Miller after nearly a night and a day of racing side by side to see if he could make the pass. The 2022 UTMB men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Mathieu Blanchard, 1. Kilian Jornet, and 3. Tom Evans. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By this time, it felt nearly inevitable that Jornet would run to the win and it was no surprise when he came into Tete aux Vents solo looking focused and fast with an 11-kilometer downhill run to the finish. Blanchard never gave up the chase, seven minutes back, while Evans passed a tired but “pumped” Walmsley to slot into third for the first time. Jornet would finish with a course-record time of 19:49:30, besting both François D’Haene’s 2014 record time (20:11:44) on a course that did not include the Pyramides Calcaires, a gnarly little climb and descent added to the UTMB course a few years back, and Capell’s 2019 time (20:19:09), which did include those extra kilometers. This is his fourth win at UTMB. Just five minutes back, Blanchard would also come into the finishing chute under the previous course record in second place. An elated Evans rounded out the podium, a stellar finish for his first UTMB. Walmsley came across the line in fourth, releasing the two DNF monkeys on his back and finishing the next step in his goal of ultimately winning this race someday. Miller, no longer on the comeback trail following surgery and recovery, but fully back, crossed the line in fifth place. Most of the back half of the men’s top 10 are runners who started slower and bided their time, moving up in the race’s second half, including France’sBeñat Marmissolle, France’sArthur Joyeux-Bouillon,Jonas Russiof Switzerland, and Romania’sRobert Hajnal. The final member of the men’s top 10, however, is France’sThibaut Garrivier, who went out hot and looked like he paid for it later, but ultimately held onto 10th place.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell An American living in France and eighth-place finisher at UTMB in 2021,Katie Schide(pre– andpost-race interviews) set out to make her mark on the race from the beginning, leading the women’s field after seven kilometers into Les Houches while being trailed closely by the trio ofMarianne Hogan(post-race interview) from Canada,Kaytlyn Gerbin(post-race interview) from the USA, andHillary Allenfrom the USA. Schide grew the gap over the next 13 kilometers into Saint-Gervais. With only one hour and 48 minutes on the race clock, a truly raw opening effort, her lead over second place Hogan was already five minutes, and she had eight minutes on third placeAudrey Tanguy(pre-race interview) of France.Jocelyne PaulyandManon Bohard, both from France also, came through in fourth and fifth withMimmi Kotka(pre-race interview), a Swede living in Chamonix, just behind them in sixth.Fu-Zhao Xiang(pre-race interview) of China,Ragna Debats(pre-race interview), who is Dutch but lives in Spain, andAzara García(pre-race interview) of Spain rounded out the top 10, running together 13 minutes behind Schide. Mimmi Kotka (left) and Kaytlyn Gerbin take in the scene at the 2022 UTMB start line. Hillary Allen also looks on in the background. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Keeping up her consistent and strong pace, Schide continued to increase her lead on the rest of the women’s field, coming into Les Contamines at 31 kilometers with 2:50 on the race clock. By then, she’d extended her lead on Hogan to over nine minutes, Tanguy to 12 minutes, and Bohard and Pauly to 15 minutes. Tanguy was probably relieved to make it past Les Contamines where she had dropped last year from severe stomach cramps. A visibly limping Kotka, who had challenged Courtney Dauwalter during last year’s UTMB during the early miles of the race before finishing third as Dauwalter won, came into Les Contamines nearly 20 minutes off the lead in sixth and would not continue. Schide continued to smile coming through the Col du Bonhomme, at about a marathon’s distance into the race, clearly enjoying her run through the night and appreciating the cheers of the spectators. Climbing one of the largest passes of the race only seemed to make her stronger. Her gap to Hogan and Tanguy had grown to about 20 minutes as the two chasers crested the col. The cheers from the enthusiastic French crowd brought smiles to both women’s faces as they passed through. The cheers continued for Bohard and Pauly, who were still running together. Katie Schide, 2022 UTMB champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The crowd at Les Chapieux, 50 kilometers in, was enthused to see Schide, erupting in huge cheers as she came in. While the gaps between the women in second through 10th grew and shrunk over the kilometers, Schide’s gap on the field had only gone one direction so far: up. She was now more than 22 minutes up on second place Hogan. By the time Schide got to Lac Combal, 66 kilometers into the race, the gap was up to 25 minutes, and it would be an additional 20 minutes for Tanguy to arrive after that. With 80 kilometers run, Schide came into Courmayeur flying, spending only eight minutes at the aid station approximately halfway into the race. The crowds were thrilled to see her, providing a warm and raucous welcome as she ran into the aid station looking smooth. But for the first time in the race thus far, Hogan had started to close the gap to the leader, whittling it down to just over 20 minutes. Smiling but with a stomach that couldn’t handle gels anymore, she quickly drank a Coke and opted for pizza for fuel. The gap between the top two women and the rest of the field continued to grow, and it was over an hour before Tanguy, Pauly, and Gerbin ran through, and a few more minutes after them to the sixth woman,Emily Hawgood, of Zimbabwe, who lives in the USA.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell While Schide had seemed unstoppable before Courmayeur, the tables seemed to turn over the next 17 kilometers to Arnouvaz as night turned to day. Schide came in with stomach issues, clearly in a rough spot, with Hogan hot on her heels, now only two minutes behind. Closing a gap of more than 18 minutes is a feat to be acknowledged, and a feisty and strong Hogan seemed energized by the coming of the day and the idea of leading the race for the first time. A struggling Schide maintained her lead over the Grand Col Ferret at 102 kilometers, but it was down to a minute, and when the women’s leader arrived at La Fouly at 112 kilometers, it was Hogan instead of Schide for the first time, with a sizable six-minute gap. By Champex-Lac at 125 kilometers, it was still Hogan in the lead and well under course record pace, now with a 10-minute gap to second. But Schide wasn’t about to give up, slowing down to let her stomach recover from its previous rough spell, and finally eating a cheese sandwich and starting to move well again. One hundred miles is a long distance to race, long enough that runners can get through rough spells and rebound. And that’s exactly what Schide did, regaining the lead in Trient at kilometer 142, not only eliminating the 10-minute gap but putting an additional 10 minutes on Hogan. By Vallorcine at 153 kilometers, the gap between the top two was up to 41 minutes, with Hogan nursing a hurt left leg. By the time the pair reached the finish line in Chamonix, they maintained their one-two position with Schide having extended the gap to some 75 minutes. It was another 35 minutes later that we saw the final member of the women’s podium arrive, Gerbin, who ran for much of the second half of the race in what she described as “no woman’s land,” well in front of those behind her but out of contact with the lead. It was apparently a comfortable spot for her, though, as she held her position strongly, and crossed the finish line back in Chamonix like she could run plenty more kilometers if needed.

2022 OCC Results: Avilés and Merillas Lead Spanish Sweep,"The 2022OCCrace started on Thursday, August 25 in Orsières, Switzerland, ran through Champex-Lac, Switzerland, and finished in Chamonix, France. It’s this Orsières, Champex-Lac, Chamonix point-to-point route that gives the race its abbreviated name. The OCC is 55 kilometers (34.2 miles), but with 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of elevation gain and a field numbering 1,200 runners. Neither defending champion —Blandine L’Hirondel(France) norJonathan Albon(U.K.) — were back for this year’s race. Both instead will contest the longerCCCrace. Both also set course records last year in 5:45 and 5:02. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont-Blanc festival: Sheila Avilés(Spain) overtook longtime leaderAllie McLaughlin(USA) late and ran to a 6:10 winning time. It was surely a fulfilling win after an injury cycle. The win also avenged a drop at this race in 2019. Avilés dropped from June’sMarathon du Mont Blancand earlier was seventh over 60k at theMadeira Island Ultra-Trail. McLaughlin fell clear to sixth, andNúria Gil(Spain) edgedDani Moreno(USA) for second. The pair ran 6:16 and 6:17, and were only 62 seconds apart. Sheila Avilés, the 2022 OCC women’s champion.

2022 TDS Results: Pommeret and Valmassoi Run to Victory,"All roads lead to Chamonix, France. That’s how it’s sometimes felt this summer, and that’s how it is with all of theUTMBMont-Blanc festival group of races too. The 2022TDS, an acronym for Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, left from Courmayeur, Italy, at midnight local time on Tuesday, August 23. Some 1,600 runners lit the night on clockwise route back to Chamonix. The challenging 145-kilometer (90 miles) path totaled 9,100 meters (29,855 feet) of elevation gain on a course that’s been run since 2019. You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont-Blanc festival: Ludovic Pommeret(France) added another win to his rich UTMB festival history. Pommeret, age 47, started as far back as 25th some seven kilometers into the race and finally moved into the standalone lead near the 99k point. There would be no question of the race’s outcome the rest of the way. Pommeret finished in 18:37, spraying champagne around the finish area before backtracking to collect high fives. Ludovic Pommeret celebrates winning the 2022 TDS. All photos: UTMB His finish time compares favorably toErik-Sebastian Krogvig‘s2021 18:49 win, though Pommeret did not approachPablo Villa‘s2019 18:03 course record. Pommeret was third himself at TDS that same year, and coincidentally also in 18:37. He was sixth earlier this year at theWestern States 100in June and famouslywon the 2016 edition of UTMBwith a big comeback. No one was close to Pommeret, butJoaquin Lopez(Ecuador) was just ahead of 26-year-oldElias Kadi(France) for second. The two finished in 19:32 and 19:49, respectively.

2022 Leadville 100 Mile Results: Gallagher and Macdonald Notch Second Wins,"The latest edition of theLeadville 100 Milehas wrapped for 2022, leaving a host of ultrarunners with bragging rights and shiny new belt buckles for their efforts. This event is among the most famous 100-mile trail races. Runners make their way through the Rocky Mountains of Colorado at elevations starting at 9,200 feet all the way up to thin-aired high point of Hope Pass at 12,508 feet. The extreme elevation and altitude make breathing difficult and add exponentially to the fatigue athletes feel as they make their way through the course. The race has been a staple of the ultrarunning community since its inception in 1983. This year, the customary shotgun blast sounded on Saturday, August 20, 2022, at 4:00 a.m. local time. A slew of contenders from previous years left the starting line, includingClare Gallagher, who won the only previous Leadville 100 Mile she had run, in 2016, as well asAdrian Macdonald, last year’s men’s champion. The Leadville 100 Mile trail race is known as the “Race Across the Sky.” It features elevations of more than 12,500 feet and sweeping views of the Colorado Rockies. Photo: Life Time Adrian Macdonaldturned heads in 2021 when he won the race as a first-time 100-mile competitor. It was clear from the start that Macdonald was primed for a repeat win if he could hold it together. All of the top 10 runners stayed close together through the first few miles of the race. But as mile 30 approached, gaps began to develop in the pack, and leaders emerged who would keep pace in front throughout the rest of the day. At the halfway mark, Macdonald had found the front of the pack and edged out a nearly 15-minute lead overTyler Andrewsin second place. Other racers includingJP Giblin,Ryan Kaiser, andChristopher Harringtonalso stood out in front. That group kept its distance from the field for the remainder of the race. But Macdonald made consistent gains in the final quarter of the race that gave him a commanding lead coming into the finish. Macdonald crossed the finish line more than two hours before anyone else. The race for the next three places stayed considerably tighter. Giblin finished second with Kaiser just about 14 minutes in tow. Andrews came through about 20 minutes later, followed by Harrington.

Back in 2016, Boulder, Colorado’s Clare Gallagher threatened to reset the Leadville 100 Mile course record in her first-ever 100-mile race. This year she came back to Leadville for the first time since then — and won again. Gallagher topped the women’s field after sparring intensely withAddie Bracythroughout much of the run. Gallagher and Bracy were neck-and-neck at the first split, running at an 8:33 pace together with only nine seconds between them. The pair traded the lead for a couple of checkpoints, but Bracy managed to pull ahead to gain about a six-minute lead on Gallagher at the 50-mile mark. Gallagher, however, used the next six miles to pull back time and pass Bracy early in the second half of the course. At the 56.5-mile mark, the coin had flipped, and Gallagher led Bracy by a roughly six-minute margin. After that, Bracy found herself unable to continue and dropped out of the race, leaving Gallagher with a dominant lead over the pack, which she held until the end. Gallagher finished at 19:37:57, more than two hours ahead of her nearest chaserAlisyn Hummelberg. Third- through fifth-place finishersLindsey Herman,Roxanne Vogel, andMadeline Hirschfeldbrought the women’s top five all in under 24 hours.

2022 Sierre-Zinal Results,"[Editor’s Note:On October 11, 2022, the organization behindSierre-Zinal released this statementregarding disciplinary proceedings for doping againstMark Kangogo, the winner of the men’s race. The final men’s ranking for the 2022 edition was suspended, pending the conclusion of these disciplinary proceedings. On October 13, the organizationreleased another statement, in which they announced thatAndreu Blanesis the winner of the 2022 Sierre-Zinal men’s race, saying “Mark Kangogo’s suspension is final. Athletics Integrity Unit informs us today that the athlete concerned ‘admitted the infraction, accepted a sanction, and waived his right of appeal’.”] The 2022 World Mountain Running Association World Cup season hit the halfway point, with its sixth race, and the Golden Trail World Series progressed too, with its fourth series event, at the 2022Sierre-Zinal. Run on storied trails in the Swiss high country each year since 1974, the ferocious 31-kilometer (19.2 miles) course consistently draws the world’s best mountain runners. The stacked field runs through the Swiss Canton (read: wine country region) of Valais, between the mountain villages of Sierre and Zinal. The compelling course kicks off on a steep climb, and then finishes on a careening downhill. The course gains 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) and loses 1,100 meters (3,600 feet). Roll call at Sierre-Zinal often reads like an all-star lineup:Jairo Correa,Anna Pichrtova,Sally Goldsmith, andRicardo Mejíahave highlighted tickets that regularly brim with world champion mountain runners, Olympians, and world record holders. Today’s 2022 entry was no different:Maude Mathys(Switzerland) returned to vie for her fourth straight Sierre-Zinal win, whileKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway) was looking for his 10th title in Valais. Here’s how the race shook out. Mathys may have won the last three women’s Sierre-Zinal entries in a row, but that didn’t impress the mountain running newcomer who took the field. Kenya’sEsther Chesangleft every woman except Mathys in the dust, posting a 2:52:01 to win. She broke out fast but soon Mathys hounded her. The pair traded fastest splits throughout the middle of the race, but Mathys could not establish a lead. Despite flying through the descent thanks to her technical prowess, Mathys finished just 30 seconds behind the 27-year-old Chesang. At times, Mathys got close enough to see the Kenyan had she broken her concentration on the choppy trail. Esther Chesang of Kenya is the 2022 Sierre-Zinal champion. Photo: Marco Gulberti/Corsa in Montagna KenyanPhiliares Kisang, the only woman to beat her countrywomanJoyce Njeruin any other World Cup race this year, took third in 2:58:00. She ran very closely with Mathys early, checking in just three seconds behind the Swiss runner at the first checkpoint of Ponchette at 58:17.

[In 2015, Mathys received a warning without suspension from the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases of Swiss Olympic for two positive tests for clomifene (previously clomiphene) after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.] Full results.

The 33-year-old came into the race fresh off breaking a course record at the last World Cup tour stop inThyon-Dixence, also in Switzerland, just last weekend, and he just missed turning the same trick at Sierre-Zinal: Jornet’s 2019 mark is just under two minutes faster.

Spain’sAndreu Blanesfinished second at 2:29:19 [Updated October 13, 2022] but was later awarded the win. No one came close to matching his pace on the back end of the course as he doggedly gained places. Also remarkably, Sierre-Zinal was only his second World Cup race this season; at Thyon-Dixence, he took fourth. Spanish orienteer Andreu Blanes was thrilled with his finish at the 2022 Sierre-Zinal and was later awarded the win.

He’d won all five previous events this season, some resoundingly. Kipngeno slated a respectable third place but faded late. Kangogo broke free from him after the uphills eased, and then Blanes blistered past him on the downhills. [Updated October 13, 2022] Upon Kangogo’s disqualification, Kipngeno was awarded second place. EritreanPetro Mamunipped Jornet in the finish chute and the pair finished just a couple hundredths of a second apart.

2022 Hardrock 100 Results: Dauwalter and Jornet Smash Course Records,"The 2022Hardrock 100was one for the record books, literally. While strong from the start, neither field went out blazingly fast, at least in relation to the fastest times run previously in this year’s clockwise direction. (The course alternates directions every other running.) However, a day later, bothKilian Jornetof Spain andCourtney Dauwalterwould shatter not only the slower clockwise course records, but the overall course records, previously set in the opposite direction with Dauwalter running 26:44:36 and Jornet recording 21:36:24. The two runners ran their respective records in very different fashions, with Courtney dominating the women’s field from “go” and Kilian having to race France’sFrançois D’HaeneandDakota Jonesbefore finally pulling away for good on the last climb of the day. Before diving into the exciting stories from the front of both races, what was the arena where this would take place? The 2022Hardrock 100kicked off at 6 a.m. on Friday, July 15. The notoriously challenging loop around the San Juan Mountains starts in Silverton, Colorado, and runs clockwise through Telluride and Ouray before heading east in the direction of Lake City and then returning to Silverton. This year, a few key changes to the course brought the total distance up to 102.5 miles, packing 33,000 feet of elevation gain and loss, all at high altitude and over rough terrain. Pre-race discussion largely focused on the meeting of Jornet and D’Haene, respectively, the clockwise and the counter-clockwise course record holders, on the men’s side, andUTMBcourse record-holderCourtney Dauwalter’ssecond attempt at the Hardrock 100. These expectations didn’t disappoint, with Jornet and D’Haene running neck and neck for 95 miles for the win and a new overall men’s course record, and Dauwalter finishing more than seven hours ahead of her nearest rival, also setting an overall course record for women. On to the full story! The men’s race at the 2022 Hardrock 100 finished pretty much in line with expectations — with an epic showdown between two of the greatest talents ever seen in the sport –Kilian Jornet(pre– andpost-race interviews) andFrançois D’Haene(pre– andpost-race interviews). But there was plenty more action along the way, with bold moves fromDakota Jones(pre– andpost-race interviews), and some strong running further back the field. Here’s how this year’s clockwise action played out. From the start, the runners made a fairly predictable formation at the front of the field. Dakota Jones, Francois D’Haene, and Kilian Jornet led the charge, running together, with Jones joking with one of our reporters that they had agreed to finish in the aforementioned order. A very happy-lookingDani Jung(pre-race interview) followed close back from the leaders in fourth at the KT aid station at mile 11.5, withJohn Kellythree minutes later in fifth. There was a gap of 10 minutes or more from this front pack toJeff BrowningandLuke Nelson, who looked to be taking it very easy in sixth and seventh. Kilian Jornet, François D’Haene, and Dakota Jones leading at mile 11.5. All photos: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The front trio remained within a few strides of each other the whole way into Ouray at mile 44, and although looking relaxed, they were already 12 minutes up on course record pace. Jung still followed in fourth, but the gap had widened to almost half an hour. He still looked very fresh and appeared to be taking the high road and running his own race, rather than getting caught up in anything outside of his comfort zone. The next three positions — Kelly, Browning, and Nelson — also remained unchanged with Kelly appearing more somber than the others, but still making a fast turnaround in the aid station. Jones was the one to make the move that cracked the front trio, and he came into the Engineer aid station at roughly the halfway point 11 minutes clear of Jornet and D’Haene, who remained together. Jung held on steadfastly in fourth, and former Hardrock champion Browning had moved up to take fifth from a struggling John Kelly. Dakota Jones leading at Animas Forks (mile 58). Jones continued to lead the way through Grizzly Gulch, two-thirds of the way into the race, but the Euro duo of Jornet and D’Haene had begun to close. By Sherman at mile 73, the two had joined forces, entering and leaving the aid station together eight minutes ahead of Jones. They continued to run within seconds of each other, but by Cunningham Gulch at mile 93, there was a notable shift in tone as the race had begun in earnest. Jornet was the first to leave the aid station with D’Haene following seconds later. D’Haene looked strong and can never be underestimated in the finish, but after the headtorches began to flicker on the final descent through Arrastra Gulch, it was Jornet who emerged first from the darkness, having put five minutes on his friend and opponent in the roughly four-mile stretch. Jornet powered through to the finish, taking his fifth victory in five Hardrock starts, and a clockwise and overall course record in a time of 21:36:34. D’Haene followed and touched the rock at 21:51:21, which was also under the original clockwise record from Jornet’s 2014 run. Kilian Jornet after winning and setting a course record at the 2022 Hardrock 100. Further back, despite losing hold of first place, Dakota Jones never stopped pushing and took third in a strong 23:06:19, making his pre-race goal of breaking 24 hours. [Bonus:Video of the top three men – Jornet, D’Haene, and Jones – chatting after the race.] An emotional Dani Jung came home in fourth, a position he held essentially all race, in a time of 25:53:47. This is just the beginning of Jung’s season, with UTMB andDiagonale des Fousstill to come, and it will be interesting to watch him build on this performance. Jeff Browning was next home, finishing his sixth Hardrock in a time of 26:17:47, saying at the finish, “It doesn’t get any easier.” Dani Jung earlier at Animas Forks (mile 58). Full results. François D’Haene happy to finish second at the 2022 Hardrock 100. The 2022 Hardrock 100 start list included 27 women, the most the race has ever had. As anticipated,Courtney Dauwalter(pre– andpost-race interviews) scored a decisive victory, setting a new clockwise and overall women’s course record.Diana Finkelpreviously held the clockwise record of 28:32 (2010) and the overall record of 27:18:24 (2009). Further back in the field, the top 10 of the field was much more closely packed this year than we’ve seen previously at Hardrock, including last year’s second- and third-place finishersDarcy Piceu(pre-race interview) andMeghan Hicks, late entrant off the waitlistHannah Green(post-race interview), and 450k Tor des Glaciers winnerStephanie Case(pre– andpost-race interviews). Here’s how the race unfolded. Dauwalter was off to an early lead, but started conservatively enough without trying to gap the course record pace immediately. She got through the Chapman aid station at mile 18 with 4:16 on the clock. Darcy Piceu andMaggie Guterl(pre-race interview) followed in second and third, some 37 minutes back, in jovial humor, waiting for each other at the aid station. They were followed 10 minutes later by Hannah Green in fourth, with Stephanie Case another two minutes back in fifth. Darcy Piceu getting her walk on at mile 11. Through Telluride at mile 28, Dauwalter had extended her lead on second place, Guterl, to 67 minutes, with Piceu coming in a close third and leaving the aid station alongside Guterl. Hannah Green followed in fourth, with Stephanie Case in fifth, who was already recovering from some early stomach issues. Past mile 33 at Kroger’s Canteen, as Dauwalter barreled ahead, the chasing women had paired off and were working together — with Piceu and Guterl still in second and third and all smiles, while Green and Case had joined forces 22 minutes back from that duo. Dauwalter arrived at the Engineer aid station, just past the halfway point, in sixth-place overall with 12:10 on the clock, still looking strong and in control. The effort was starting to show by Sherman at mile 73, but she was still eating well and focused. Hannah Green in her element at mile 11. Stephanie Case, who had crept up the women’s field, arrived into Sherman as second woman. Hannah Green followed in third at mile 73 — looking tired, but calm and collected as she had done all race — with Darcy Piceu and Meghan Hicks nipping at her heels in fourth and fifth. By this point, Dauwalter was more than five hours clear of her nearest women’s competitor, and thoughts were starting to turn to Diana Finkel’s longstanding course records. After a relatively conservative beginning, Dauwalter finally took the lid off of course record pace by mile 93 at Cunningham Gulch, coming in with 24:16 on the clock. She seemed to grow in strength and resolve as the finish line approached, and eventually stormed home in a time of 26:44:38, to add Hardrock 100 to her litany of wins, course records, and other ultrarunning achievements. Stephanie Case trying to enjoy a slice of pizza in Telluride. Case ran strong to the ending, finishing her first Hardrock 100 in second place in 33:52:46.

"2022 Marathon du Mont-Blanc Results: Gold for Jon Albon, Sara Alonso","This weekend, the 2022Marathon du Mont-Blancreturned to lush Chamonix, France, just before 8 a.m. local time on Sunday, June 26. As part of theGolden Trail World Series, the marathon is known to draw some of the world’s highest-performing trail runners each year. And this year’s lineup was no exception. For 2022, race organizers repatterned the course and opted for an all-new finish line at Place du Triangle de l’Amitie — in the heart of Chamonix. The route charts competitors over 42 kilometers (26.2 miles) of immensely varied terrain, from gentle municipal roads to rocky switchbacks. Cumulatively, it climbs some 2,540 meters (8,333 feet). It’s one short race that’s just as stunning as it is grueling. The start of the 2022 Marathon du Mont-Blanc.

That time put Albon ahead of the rest of the men’s field by more than four minutes. Italy’sDavide Magniniwas second to the podium with an official time of 3:39:41. A minute later,Ruy Uedaof Japan clinched the final podium spot, at 3:40:42. Moroccan-Swiss athleteElhousine Elazzaoui(3:43:19) and France’sThibaut Baronian(3:47:27) rounded out the top five in the men’s race.

2022 Western States 100 Results,"Thanks to HOKA for sponsoring iRunFar’s coverage of the 2022 Western States 100. After the COVID-19-pandemic-year cancellation of 2020, followed by a year of travel restrictions, which reduced the numbers of overseas runners, the 2022Western States 100was back to being a truly international celebration of ultrarunning. Roughly 380 runners from 32 countries began their journey from Olympic Valley to Auburn, California, at 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 25, 2022. After unusually chilly and wet weather in the days beforehand, normal service resumed on race day with another scorcher of a day for this year’s race. The heat wasn’t enough to slow downAdam Peterman(post-race interview), who decisively won his first 100 miler in a superb 15:13:48, orRuth Croft(post-race interview), who returned following a second-place finish last year to take the win in 17:21:30, shaving 12 minutes off her previous time. In doing so, she ran the third-best time in the race’s 49-year history. A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible! Thanks also toBUFF®andSquirrel’s Nut Butterfor their support of our Western States coverage. If you like what we’re doing,here are the ways you can help support iRunFar. Thank you! The start of the 2022 Western States 100 on June 25 in Olympic Valley, California. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Last year’s winnerBeth Pascallwas absent from the start list for 2022, but there was still plenty of talent toeing the line. Six of last year’s top 10 made the final starting list, including hot favorite and previous second-place finisher, New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and last year’s seventh-place womanEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview), a Zimbabwean living in the U.S., who was believed to be capable of ruffling some feathers on her second attempt. Outside of the returning top runners, this year’s start list also featured 100-mile world record holderCamille Herron(post-race interview), former podium finisherLucy Bartholomewof Australia, and second-place woman at last year’s UTMB, France’sCamille Bruyas(pre-race interview). Herron was first to the top of the Escarpment, the race’s high point at mile 3.5, withEllie Pellhot on her heels. They were followed byKeely Henninger, Poland’sDominika Stelmach,Katie Asmuth(pre-race interview), Canada’sMarianne Hogan(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Lindsey Hagen, and Bruyas, all within a couple of seconds of each other. Hawgood followed along in ninth position, followed by Switzerland’sLuzia Buehler(pre-race interview) in 10th. The race had yet to space out at Lyon Ridge at mile 10, with Stelmach, Herron, and Hogan coming in together, closely followed by Henninger, Hawgood, Asmuth, and Pell. By Red Star Ridge at mile 15, Croft had begun to make her presence felt and climbed up the field to fourth position. Hogan led the field into Duncan Canyon, mile 24, just 20 seconds clear of Stelmach in second, and then Hawgood, Henninger, and Croft. By Robinson Flat, mile 30, Hawgood and Croft had moved up to share the lead, and they continued to run together through mile 38, which they passed just under course record pace. At the finish line, Hawgood remarked that she and Croft ran together for so long that they felt like it was a weekend-long run and not a race, a great experience for her. Stelmach followed about 90 seconds back in third, a minute clear of Henninger in fourth. Herron had moved back to seventh position but still looked good.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The two leaders were still together at Devil’s Thumb, mile 47, but shortly after Croft managed to break away and ran through Deadwood Cemetery, mile 49.5, seven minutes back of course record pace. Hawgood came through just 30 seconds later, still looking happy and fresh and Henninger looked strong in third, 1:15 back from Croft. The top two remained the same through mile 62, Foresthill, but Herron had begun to fight back and moved up to third position, about 18 minutes back from the leader and four minutes clear of Canada’sAilsa MacDonald(post-race interview) who had moved into fourth after running the first half of the race right outside the top five looking steady.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks By Cal 2 at mile 70, Croft maintained an 11-minute lead on Hawgood, who was continuing to apply pressure, and MacDonald had edged past Herron into third. By the Rucky Chucky river crossing, mile 78, Croft had further extended her lead, but the real action was taking place behind her, with MacDonald making moves and climbing up to second place, 24 minutes back from Croft and three clear of Hawgood. As she crossed the river, she was legitimately smiling from ear to ear, remarking, “I’m having the best day of my life!” Then with 10 miles to go at Quarry Road, Hogan, who had never been too far out of the frame, made a push and climbed up to third position.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Croft sealed the deal with a 17:21:30 finish to take the win, the third-fastest women’s time on record. MacDonald finished impressively close, just 25 minutes back in 17:46:46. Hogan took the final podium spot in 18:08:32, less than three minutes clear of Buehler in fourth, in a race that really wasn’t over ’til it was over. Hawgood, who ran a brave race, finished fifth in 18:16:02, almost an hour better than her previous time. We expect there will be more to come from her if she takes her place on the 2023 start line. In what is certainly a first for the event, the top five women were all from abroad — what an international event at the front of the women’s field this year!

Herron, who’s had bad luck in this race before, had a strong eighth-place finish in 18:51:54, and Asmuth and Bruyas rounded out the top 10 in 19:30:26 and 19:34:24 respectively. Ultimately, 11 women broke 20 hours this year, with CanadianAnne-Marie Madden(pre-race interview) finishing just outside the top 10 in 19:38:44. Women’s DNFs included Bartholomew and Henninger, both due to injury. Third place woman Marianne Hogan runs through Dusty Corners at mile 38 of the 2022 Western States 100.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks This year’s men’s race had the notable absence of course record holderJim Walmsley, who has dominated the race in recent years, leaving it wide open for a good number of runners with the potential to win. Among them were seven of last year’s top 10, including second-place finisherTyler Green(pre-race interview) andTim Tollefson(pre-race interview), who was fifth last year but hotly fancied to be capable of winning this race on a good day. Last year’s eighth-place man,Hayden Hawks(post-race interview), who ran Western States as his debut 100 miler, was also believed to have more to offer in this race. Notably, joining them as a Golden Ticket entrant wasJared Hazen(pre-race interview), the second-fastest Western States finisher of all time. And last, but certainly not least, the relative new kid on the block, who has quickly shot up through the distances and dominated every ultra he’s ever started —Adam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Peterman won his way into Western States with a Golden Ticket at theCanyons by UTMB 100k, where he toppled the course record in his first-ever 100-kilometer race. He took a gamble by taking on his first 100 miler a little over two months later, and defended the decision to iRunFar in his pre-race interview saying: “I don’t feel like I always need to just make logical steps because we’re running 100 miles, that’s an illogical game.” Adam Peterman makes his way across the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78 of the 2022 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The first 3.5 miles of Western States feature 2,550 feet of climbing, to the first landmark at the Escarpment. First to the top wasAdam Kimble, closely followed by France’sLudovic Pommeret— with Hawks, France’sSeb Spehler(pre-race interview), and Hazen coming through in quick succession. Tollefson,Tom Owens(U.K.), Peterman,Jonathan Rea, andAlex Nicholscompleted the front 10, all within a couple of minutes of each other. By Lyon Ridge at mile 10, Ludovic had taken the lead and he came through Red Star Ridge at mile 15, four minutes clear of Spehler in second, with Kimble in third, and Hawks and Tollefson a few minutes back, followed by Hazen, Peterman, andArlen Glick(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Nine minutes separated the first eight runners to this point. The two Frenchmen held the top positions into mile 24, just before Duncan Canyon, with Pommeret coming through six minutes off course record pace. At this point, Tollefson had moved up to third, and Hawks and Peterman sat comfortably in fourth and fifth, 8:10 back from the lead, with Glick following 10 seconds behind. Pommeret held the lead into Robinson Flat, mile 30, with the pressure starting to show. Hawks had moved up to second by now and was looking a lot more comfortable, just two minutes back from the leader. Peterman had then moved up the field also to third position, just in front of Spehler, who’d dropped back to fourth, with Tollefson seconds behind. This chasing pack was just four-and-a-half minutes off the leader. Hayden Hawks climbs up toward Michigan Bluff at mile 55 of the 2022 Western States 100. He went on to finish second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By Miller’s Defeat at mile 34, Hawks had closed the gap to a minute, and by Dusty Corners, mile 38, he’d taken the lead from Pommeret. Through Deadwood Cemetery, mile 49.5, Hawks maintained the lead and looked like he was having a super day. There had been some reshuffling in the other top positions, with Peterman, Hazen, and Glick all still in the mix. By Foresthill, mile 62, Hawks was still in the lead but Peterman had separated himself from the other chasers in second. He arrived just three minutes back from Hawks and almost eight minutes clear of Hazen in third. Spehler, who had a promising first half, had dropped back the field suffering stomach issues, and Tollefson had also fallen back from the front runners. Hawks was still in the lead after Foresthill, but by Cal 2, mile 70, Peterman had joined him at the front and the race was on! Hazen held third place, 14 minutes back from the leaders, with Glick in fourth another 15 minutes back from Hazen. Arlen Glick runs into Michigan Bluff at mile 55 of the 2022 Western States 100. He went on to finish third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell When the race reached the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78, Hawks still looked comfortable but Peterman had stretched four minutes ahead, putting 30 seconds per mile on his opponent since Cal 2, showing unbelievable strength and poise for a 100-mile debut. Hazen maintained third position, now 24 minutes off the lead, with Glick and France’sVincent Vietmaking up the front five. Notably, Viet was running a strong race, running around the fifth to seventh positions all day. Hazen had started to struggle and soon took a chair at the mile 85 aid station, with Glick moving up to third. Peterman had by now extended his lead to 10 minutes. The top three positions remained unchanged for the remainder of the race, but Peterman utterly dominated in the closing miles, finishing in 15:13:48, almost 34 minutes clear of Hawks in 15:47:27. Glick rounded out the top three in 15:56:17. Adam Peterman wins the 2022 Western States 100 in his first effort at the 100-mile distance. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It’s clear from this 100-mile debut that we will be seeing a lot more of Peterman. He executed this win in a similarly patient manner to his win at the Canyons 100k, and he races like a runner with a lot more ultrarunning experience than he has. Moving up all race again, Green ended the day in fourth position in 15:57:10, what was two places back but some 13 minutes faster than his debut at this race last year.Drew Holmen(pre-race interview) finished fifth after a strong, all-day performance. His 16:09 finish this year is also two places back but 14 minutes faster than last year. These two gentlemen have much in common, including their remarks at the finish that they were incredibly happy at the finish having gotten the best out of themselves on the day. Frenchman Pommeret stayed strong to finish in sixth place and as the first men’s masters finisher, and he was closely chased by fellow Frenchman Viet. Nichols moved up two spots this year to take eighth.Cody Lind(post-race interview) moved back from fourth last year to ninth this year. AndScott Traermeted out his race effort perfectly to run his way into the men’s top 10 late in the day for a 10th place. Men’s DNFs included Spehler and Hazen, both due to various physical issues.

2022 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Results: Nienke Brinkman and Kilian Jornet Break Records,"The last time iRunFar covered Spain’s legendaryZegama-Aizkorri Marathon, the runners in the field made it count. In 2017,Stian Angermund-VikandMaite Maioraset the previous men’s and women’s course records, respectively, at 3:45:08 and 4:34:27. This year, the first race of the Golden Trail World Series (GTWS) promised no less excitement when the gun sounded at 9 a.m. Central European Time on May 29, 2022. And it delivered — the thinnest of margins separated the men’s leaders for the bulk of the race, and the dominant women’s leader set a record pace. After two years of cancellations due to COVID-19, runners took off on the marathon-length course covering 8,876 feet of vertical climb. To say thefield was stackedwas like saying the sky is blue.Kilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway),Maude Mathys(Switzerland),Nienke Brinkman(The Netherlands, lives in Switzerland),Oriol Cardona(Spain),Manuel Merillas(Spain), andCourtney Dauwalter(USA) packed the grid, among others. It’s hard to imagine a more formulaic race, and the use of that adjective is not a knock. Like the Alpe d’Huez climb in the Tour de France, the course surges out into the thick of a 15,000-spectator throng crammed along its hyper-technical route. Zegama is Zegama, they say. Verily. Crowds of supporters lined the route for the 2022 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon. All photos: Toño Miranda You could sayNienke Brinkman’sfirst Zegama was a good one. You could also say it was a historic one. Brinkman ledMaude Mathysby three minutes around the halfway point. That condition prevailed and the young Dutchwoman ultimately defied expectations to beat Mathys by over nine minutes and turn in a 4:16:43 to smash the existing course record by more than 18 minutes. Brinkman never trailed in the race past the five-mile mark and ran almost the whole race alone, during a seasonreplete with headline performances. In her post-race interview, she said she came into the race underprepared. Sure. It’s fair to say that Brinkman, who has notched a 2:22 marathon performance and a Zegama course record within the span of two months, is changing the sport of running as we type this. Sara Alonso(Spain) rounded out the top three, 37 seconds behind Mathys and well inside the previous course record. (In 2015, Mathys received a warning without suspension from the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases of Swiss Olympic for two positive tests for clomifene [previously clomiphene] after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.)

Nienke Brinkman, 3. Sara Alonso, and 5. Fabiola Conti. Kilian JornetandDavide Magnini(Italy) ran neck and neck — amazingly so — for over 14 miles on Sunday. At the first checkpoint at 5.3 miles, Jornet led Magnini by a second. By the next one, 3.1 miles later, Magnini had grabbed a one-second lead. The two ran side-by-side, never hitting a checkpoint more than two seconds apart, until Jornet started to pull away during a steep descent in the race’s 16th mile. And by the time he cruised down the cobblestones on his way to the finish line, he held a commanding two-minute, 30-second lead. Jornet broke the tape at 3:36:40 and won the race for the 10th time, turning in a new record more than nine minutes faster than the existing one. Magnini followed at 3:39:31, also well inside the old course record and the second-fastest time logged on the route ever — a valiant effort by the 24-year-old Italian ski mountaineer. Manuel Merillastook third in 3:45:43, a half-minute off the previous course record. Kilian Jornet, the 2022 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon men’s champion. Full results.

2022 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: Gold for Joe McConaughy and Annie Hughes,"The second annualCocodona 250 Milebegan at 10 a.m. U.S. Mountain Time on Monday, May 2, in Prescott, Arizona. Runners endured scenic but brutal terrain over the 254-mile course and climbed more than 30,000 feet to arrive in the northern city of Flagstaff. This year’s course was heavily modified from its intended route due to wildfires. The official cutoff time for the race is 122 hours, and it ends on Saturday, May 7. This year’s event, put on by Aravaipa Running, did not disappoint and saw some impressive times set by those earliest to the finish line. Thru-hiker and ultrarunnerJoe McConaughyand young phenomAnnie Hughesclinched the men’s and women’s top spots on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, respectively. At the time of publication, runners continue to trickle across the finish line, totally worked but generally beaming. Joe McConaughy, aka Stringbean (his trail name in the thru-hiking community), ran the entirety of the race in absolutely stellar form and broke the tape in a diminutive 59:28:54. That signified a more than six-hour lead over the rest of the field. Michael McKnightpicked up the pace in the back half of the race to close that gap. At 65:39:16, McKnight crossed the threshold at Heritage Square, claiming second place in the men’s race. United States Marine veteranMatt Smithgained steady momentum, moving from the middle of the pack to round out the men’s podium late in the race. He finished in 73:01:19.

With just 71:10:22 down, the 24-year-old claimed first in the women’s race. She led the women all race, and did so with nearly no sleep — only a few catnaps along the way. This is Hughes’ second 200-plus-mile race in seven months, as she won the 2021Moab 240 Milelast October. Second in the women’s race belonged toLauren Jones, whose steady pace throughout delivered her to the finish line at 78:34:16. Some five hours later, Aravaipa’s ownSarah Ostaszewskilanded the final podium spot, with an official time of 84:21:24. Notably, Ostaszewski finished fifth in last year’s Cocodona showdown and looked pleased to have bested her previous performance by two spots.

2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k Results,"A weekend for record-shattering continues, with both the men’s and women’s course records falling at the 2022Canyons by UTMB 100k.Adam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished in 8:31:58, taking almost 40 minutes offAnthony Costales’s2021 record of 9:11:40. Canada’sJazmine Lowther(post-race interview) dominated the women’s race from the get-go, and finished in 10:01:54, shaving just one second offBeth Pascall’srecord of 10:01:55, also set at the 2021 event. The 2022 Canyons 100k had double appeal, as one of the 25 worldwide events on the inaugural UTMB World Series, but, more pressingly, as the final Golden Ticket race for theWestern States 100. The race attracted a stacked field, in both the men’s and women’s races, eager to battle it out for those top three spots. A lot of eyes were onJared Hazen(post-race interview), who is no stranger to these trails, albeit more often seen running them in the other direction. His time of 14:26:46 from the 2019 Western States 100 is still the second-fastest time on record. Having yet to secure a place in this year’s Western States 100, the stakes were high for him toeing the line at Canyons.Brittany Peterson(pre-race interview) was also hard to ignore, with a strong resume in similar races to this challenging, uphill course. The Canyons by UTMB 100k starts in Auburn, California. It at times runs parallel to and at other times tracks on the Western States Trail in the opposite direction, before deviating onto wilder terrain with steep and rocky descents, and ends with a grueling climb out of an upper drainage of Eldorado Canyon to the finish at China Wall. The gun went off at 5 a.m. on Saturday, April 23, in favorable conditions following a turbulent few days of rain, thunderstorms, and even snow at higher elevations. Hoka shoes in their native habitat at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k. All photos: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Jazmine Lowther(post-race interview) was making moves from the start. The Canadian runner was clearly in fast shape going into the race, coming off a third-place finish at the competitiveChuckanut 50klast month. She covered the first 5.5 miles in 41 minutes and had already extended a two-minute lead at that point on second-placeAroa Sio(post-race interview), winner of the 2019Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 85k, who was followed in quick succession byAnne GeorgeandCarla Molinaro.Jenny Quiltywas through a minute later in fifth position. Positions six to 14 all stuck together for the early part of the race, and the pack included strong contendersBrittany Peterson(pre-race interview),Ladia Albertson-Junkans(pre-race interview), andAnna Mae Flynn(pre-race interview). By mile 14.8, Lowther and Sio maintained the top-two spots, while Albertson-Junkans had broken away from the pack and moved up to third place. Albertson-Junkans had to be a strong contender following her win at Chuckanut 50k last month, and she has proven herself in the past at longer distances too, including a second-place finish at theBandera 100kin 2019. Ladia Albertson-Junkans running happy during the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k. Coming into the Foresthill aid station at mile 32.5, Lowther was still in the lead with 4:47 on the clock. Albertson-Junkans was through 17 minutes later having moved up to second with Sio in hot pursuit. Peterson had also broken away from the chasing pack at this point and moved up to fourth position. The top-three positions remained unchanged when the race reached Deadwood Cemetery 1, 44.3 miles in, with Lowther continuing to dominate and maintaining her 17-minute lead on Albertson-Junkans, and Sio trailing three minutes back in third. Peterson had fallen back to ninth position, and later withdrew from the race. She was replaced in fourth byLeah Yingling(post-race interview) — the third-place woman at this year’s Bandera 100k. Jazmine Lowther won the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k and narrowly set a course record in doing so. While battles were fought for the remaining podium spots, Lowther never faltered in her tour de force. Coming back into Deadwood Cemetery #2 at the final aid station in 7:54:16, now almost 23 minutes clear of the rest of the pack, she appeared to be on course to threaten Beth Pascall’s 2021 course record of 10:01:55. It was nail-bitingly tight, but with an unbelievable one-second margin, Jazmine Lowther broke the tape in 10:01:54 to claim victory in the 2022 Canyon’s by UTMB 100k, a course record, and a coveted Golden Ticket. Following a very patient run, where she climbed steadily up through the field all day, Leah Yingling finished in second in 10:24:51. Aroa Sio, who had a great run and was never out of contention, rounded out the women’s podium in 10:27:42. Both Yingling and Sio also immediately accepted their Western States 100 Golden Tickets. Leah Yingling takes second at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k and accepts her Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Full results. The 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Leah Yingling, 1. Jazmine Lowther, and 3. Aroa Sio. The men’s race was not run quite so decisively from the start. At 5.5 miles, the elites were tightly packed together, with, it seemed, no one wanting to be the one to make the first move. By 14.8 miles, the top three were still running together, making good tracks with just 1:54:30 on the clock. The trio was made up ofAdam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Tim Freriks(pre-race interview),David Sinclair(post-race interview),Jared Hazen(post-race interview), andAnthony Leefollowed in fourth and fifth, still with the lead pack within sight. Peterman undoubtedly had the speed to do well at Canyons, with 2021JFK 50 Mileand 2022 Chuckanut 50k wins under his belt, but it remained to be seen how the step-up in distance would suit him. Tim Freriks has plenty of experience going back as far as the 2016Lake Sonoma 50 Mile, where he finished second. Adam Peterman wins the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k in course-record time. At Cal 2 (mile 24.5) it was still anybody’s race. At 3:14 into the race, the lead pack of David Sinclair, Adam Peterman,Daniel Jones,Dave Stevens, Jared Hazen, and Anthony Lee all entered the aid station together. Tim Freriks had fallen back a little and followed in seventh place, four minutes off the leading pack. He would unfortunately later drop from the race. By Foresthill (mile 32.5) things had finally started to space out a little and the lead pack was reduced to two, Peterman and Sinclair, who ran through looking fresh, 4:17 into the race. Hazen took up position in third, two-and-a-half minutes back from the leaders. By Michigan Bluff, at mile 38.7, Sinclair had taken the lead by a minute and a half. Peterson did not appear to be panicking and looked happy and relaxed, while Hazen maintained his third-place position, with the pressure beginning to show. David Sinclair is stoked on second place at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k. The order was the same coming into Deadwood Cemetery 1, with Peterman now just 30 seconds off Sinclair in front, and Hazen holding his own in third, about 15 minutes ahead of Daniel Jones in fourth. Peterman took the lead out on the loop and came through the final checkpoint, Deadwood Cemetery 2, four minutes ahead of Sinclair. He proved the 100k distance was no trouble at all to him, and he continued to distance himself from the chasers through the tough final section to finish in a remarkable 8:31:58. Sinclair finished second in 8:43:00 and Hazen in third in 8:47:33, with all three coming in under the previous course record of 9:11:40. After finishing third at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k, Jared Hazen earned a Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Full results. Rod Farvard on his way to taking fourth at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k.

2022 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: Event Records for Jim Walmsley and Courtney Dauwalter,"The 2022Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) kicked off at midnight on Saturday, April 23, in Porto Moniz on the northwest coast of the Portuguese island of Madeira. Runners endured steep, technical terrain over the 115-kilometer (72-mile) course and climbed some 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) to arrive in Machico on the southeast coast. The 13th MIUT took off without a hitch, and favorable island weather paved the way for a handful of exceptional performances. This year’s MIUT belonged to American favoritesJim WalmsleyandCourtney Dauwalter, with both setting event records, although the course has changed a bit through time. At 12:58:27, Walmsley broke the tape in Machico and surpassedFrancois D’Haene’s2017 MIUT timeby more than seven minutes. Less than two hours later, Dauwalter claimed a beyond-decisive win in the women’s race in 14:40:35. Her time broke the previous women’s event record of 15:00:55 set byCaroline Chaverotin 2016. The two American runners continue to dominate following their highly successful 2021 race seasons. Their sweep in Madeira this weekend is reminiscent of their similarly impressivesweep at the2021Ultra-Trail Cape Town. In a notable coincidence, both men’s and women’s silver medals went to French runners, while Switzerland took both bronzes. The start of the 2022 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 115k. Photo: Madeira Island Ultra-Trail The MIUT course apparently plays to Dauwalter’s strengths, and the temperate conditions may have had something to do with her strong run on this unrelenting course. She led the women’s pack through all but the second checkpoint (kilometer 22.4), where she was tied with France’sAudrey Tanguy. But by the 32.7-kilometer mark, the Coloradan had moved more than six minutes clear of Tanguy. She cemented her lead, expanding it to nearly 20 minutes by kilometer 48.4. Dauwalter last raced MIUT in 2019, and she claimed a similarly decisive win in that race (2019 MIUT interview), finishing in a time of 15:17:05, 26 minutes clear of second-placeKatie Schide. Her performance in 2022 improved on her 2019 winning time by more than half an hour. Tanguy arrived in Machico with 16:15:17 on the clock, claiming second in the women’s race. Though she finished nearly 1.5 hours behind Dauwalter, Tanguy ran a strong race, maintaining second place throughout all but the second checkpoint, where she ran with Dauwalter. The French runner held her own, running within five minutes of her own time from her2019 MIUT showing, where she eked out a bronze in a time of 16:10:59. Switzerland’sKathrin Götzclaimed the final podium spot in MIUT, crossing the line at 16:39:11. Götz, like the two women ahead of her, ran a similarly steady race. The Swiss competitor took the third position by kilometer 22.4 and never let go. Rounding out the women’s top five were France’sMaryline Nakache(16:56:06) and Sweden’sElisabeth Borgersen(17:30:22). Full results. Courtney Dauwalter, 2022 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail champion. Photo: Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Walmsley took an immediate lead in his first international race of the year and was thefirst to enter each of the ten checkpointsbetween Porto Moniz and Machico, finishing 26:44 ahead of the runner-up. Thibaut Garrivierwas second to the podium, arriving at 13:24:58. The Frenchman ran a patient race, sitting back in ninth and seventh at the first and second checkpoints, respectively. By the time he arrived at the checkpoint in Casa do Pico Ruivo (kilometer 74.2), Garrivier had climbed up through the field and was in second place. He maintained that position for the remaining 40.8 kilometers (25.4 miles). Switzerland’sJean-Philippe Tschumiclosed out the men’s podium at 13:38:55, nearly 41 minutes behind Walmsley. Tschumi and Garrivier were hot on each other’s heels from the start — both men shared the ninth position at checkpoint one. The Swiss runner had pulled into second place by the 48.4-kilometer mark, then dropped to third at kilometer 63.2 and kept that rank through to the end. Fourth and fifth place belonged to Frenchman living in CanadaMathieu Blanchard(13:51:43) and Italy’sAndreas Reiterer(14:10:01). Full results.

"2022 Marathon des Sables Results: Rachid El Morabity Comes Back, Anna Comet Sizzles","The Sahara Desert’sMarathon des Sables(MdS) is as scorching as it is revered. After an October comeback last year following a 2.5-year COVID-19-induced hiatus, the race returned to Morocco again this March. Temperatures well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit and plenty of blistering sunshine are hallmarks of the seven-day, 155-mile desert stage race. Finishing it — or simply running in it — is no joke. Each year, race organizers deploy 120,000 liters of water, a support staff numbering in the hundreds, and a wide array of vehicles, aircraft, and even camels to monitor the action and keep runners safe. Last year, brutal heat and a virulent stomach bugcaused an unusually high 40% dropout rate. In this edition, conditions in the field appear somewhat more stable. However, challenging desert weather still wreaked havoc at times throughout the week of racing. The 2022 Marathon des Sables started with fair weather on Sunday, March 27. But high heat and howling wind beset the race’s second stage the next day. Though only moderately long, Stage 2 also negotiated plenty of steep terrain. The wild second stage scrambled runners, especially some perennial race favorites. Eight-time MdS winnerRachid El Morabity(Morocco) led the field coming out of Stage 1 but lost 9 minutes during the marathon-length Stage 2. He landed in third place behind his younger brother,Mohamed El Morabity, a first for the pair as Mohamed has finished second in this race four times, and each behind his winning brother. Mohamed maintained his lead — by a razor-thin margin of 37 seconds — through Stage 4 on Wednesday. On the women’s side, first-time Marathon des Sables entrantAnna Comet(Spain) was untouchable. Comet ran in a league of her own for the majority of the race, building a lead of up to 53 minutes by the end of Stage 4.Sylvaine Cussot(France) set an equally solid course all week, generally finishing several minutes behind Comet but well in front of the rest of the field, to hold in second place all week. The gun sounded at the 2022 Marathon des Sables’ fifth and final competitive stage on Friday, April 1. The first finishers broke the tape in the early afternoon, Moroccan local time. The final, noncompetitive Stage 6 takes place on Saturday, April 2. A beautiful Sahara Desert sunset during the 2022 Marathon des Sables. Photo: Cimbaly_MDS2022@FranckOddoux Rachid El Morabity stormed back to win, outpacing the rest of the field — and his younger brother — in the race’s final stage. Mohamed led by around half a minute at all checkpoints on Stage 5, but Rachid overtook him late, and then pulled away. His Marathon des Sables dominance continues— it’s the ninth time he’s won the race. Mohamed El Morabity played second fiddle yet again. He claimed his fifth runner-up MdS finish all-time. Aziz Yachou(Morocco) was the only other runner to finish under 19 hours cumulatively. A strong Stage 5, where he took second, left him 4 minutes back of Rachid El Morabity’s week-long pace. This is Yachou’s second MdS effort, and he improved on his fourth-place debut in 2021. Merile Robert(France) took fourth and missed the podium for the first time since 2017, andJordan Tropf(United States) took fifth.

Photo: imbaly_MDS2022@FranckOddoux Thanks to Anna Comet, the 2022 women’s Marathon des Sables was never close. She came into Stage 5 leading by almost an hour, and then broke the tape over an hour before second-place finisher Sylvaine Cussot in the cumulative rankings. Aziza El Amrany(Morocco) rounded out the podium, a sharp debut performance for this Moroccan breakout runner. 2021 MdS women’s winnerAziza Raji(Morocco) finished fourth andManuela Vilaseca(Spain) came in fifth. Bethany Rainbow(United Kingdom) finished sixth as the only other woman to run the race in under 30 hours. She ran a valiant final stage to come in under the gun, finishing just 4:30 behind Comet for second place in the stage.

"2022 Transgrancanaria Results: Debats, Villa Win on Windy and Rainy Course","The 2022Transgrancanariakicked off on a brisk Friday night on Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. The demanding course draws elite runners from all over the world; this year was no exception. Four-time championPau Capellof Spain returned to the race after an injury sidelined him in 2021. Spanish runnerPablo Villashared the podium with Capell in 2020; he returned hungry this year after suffering an injury during last year’s Transgrancanaria.

Spanish runnerClaudia Trempslooked to challenge at the top, too, as the 2021 runner-up. The 126-kilometer (78-mile) “Classic” Transgrancanaria course is a dream race for ultrarunners for a few reasons: the sublime island backdrop just off the Moroccan coast makes for inspiring scenery, the weather can lead to an unpredictable race, and the course is demanding with its 7,500 meters (24,000 feet) of gain. This year’s race kicks off the second annualSpartan Trail World Championshipscircuit, which covers every continent except Antarctica. The gun sounded at the start line at Las Canteras Beach at 11:00 p.m. local time on Friday night and concluded Saturday at Parque Sur in the town of Maspalomas. Early finishers broke the tape around noon local time on Saturday. Harsh weather hounded the runners from the get-go as consistent rain, high wind, and fluctuating temperatures made for tough going. Conditions were so adverse that race officials chose to cut the route in the steep, high-altitude terrain around Roque Nublo. Runners climb a steep slope in rough weather during the 2022 Transgrancanaria. Photo: Carlos Diaz-Recio The nasty weather didn’t bother Dutch runnerRagna Debats, who prevailed in the women’s race with a time of just over 16 hours. Debats distanced herself from the pack around midway and never looked back, winning comfortably over second-place finisherAbby Hallof the U.S. Debats came in as a favorite after retiring from last year’s Transgrancanaria. Last year’s second place, Claudia Tremps, was this year’s third-place woman. Previous champion Kaytlyn Gerbin crossed the finish line in eighth place.

2021 Desert Solstice Track Invitational Results: American Records Galore,"Sustained speed was on full display at the 2021Desert Solstice Track Invitationalon Saturday and Sunday, December 11 and 12. The invite-only meet, taking place on a traditional track, brought together a fascinating combination of quick-footed trail and road specialists in the 24-hour and 100-mile event, and a number of those runners took home new American overall, track, and age group records, includingNick Coury,Camille Herron, andPam Smith. The weather was excellent, with temperatures ranging between 45 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and low humidity, during the late fall event in Phoenix, Arizona. Though the Aravaipa Running race was open to spectators both in-person and onlive stream, just 25 elite runners participated, the event pitting them against the eternal question, “How far can I run in a day?” Any ultramarathon of this length holds surprises, and the 2021 Desert Solstice was no exception. Records were set, some runners finished at 100 miles or 200 kilometers into the event, and by the time it was all over, just three women and four men participated in the final hours of the 24-hour race. The top performance of the weekend goes toNick Coury, who nabbed a new men’s American 24-hour record. Previously held byMike Mortonat 172.45 miles, Coury ran a masterclass of a race to finish in 173.01 miles.He ran nearly every single lap under 2 minutes and 10 seconds, with a few at 2:20-plus sprinkled in there for refueling and bathroom breaks. Incredibly, his last eight laps were under 2:00, and his last few at or under 1:30 – that’s six-minutes-per-mile pace! Coury also won the 2020 Desert Solstice 24 Hour by posting 155 miles.   A post shared by Aravaipa Running (@aravaiparunning) Another record fell on the men’s side this weekend, this time byJacob Jackson. Jackson, who came in second in the 24-hour race with 157.33 miles, set a men’s American 40-to-44 age group record for 200 kilometers. He broke it handily, coming in at 17:51:17, beating the previous 18:00:12 record by nearly nine minutes. The final two men who stayed in the 24-hour race wereScott Traer, who finished with 152.36 miles, andMatthew Urbanski, who clocked 131.77 miles. David Laneywas the one to watch for the men’s 100-mile race, and he surpassed that distance faster than everyone else, clocking 12:34:59. Full results. The winner of the women’s 24-hour race wasMarisa Lizakin 140.18 miles. Lizak ran a gutsy race: she was on a great pace for the first 265 laps, with all of her laps under a 2:10. After about 87 miles, her pace gradually declined, and it was clear she was gritting through a lot of pain. Lizak was seen limping around the track for the last few hours and collapsed to the ground after her 24-hour victory. Coming in second for the 24-hour race,Jian Springerset women’s American 50-to-54 age group records for 24 hours with 135.17 miles, 100 miles in 16:36:11, and 200 kilometers in 21:41:31. Mandie Holmeswas the third and final woman standing in the 24-hour race, finishing with 133.67 miles. At the 100-mile distance,Camille Herronreset her own women’s American 100-mile track record to 13:21:51 from her previous 13:25:00. Herron, who looked strong and smooth throughout the race, was also the 2018 Desert Solstice champ, whereshe set the women’s 24-hour world record.   A post shared by Aravaipa Running (@aravaiparunning)  Pam Smithset four women’s American 45-to-49 age group records during her 100-mile effort: 50 miles in 6:40:49, 100 kilometers in 8:21:36, 83.59 miles for 12 hours, and 100 miles in 15:15:02. She beat the previous records handily, each by 40 to 60 minutes. Viktoria Brownbested the women’s Canadian 100-mile record, lowering the time from 15:19:45 to 14:47:13. Full results.

2022 Western States 100 Top Entrants,"With 6,208 entrants with a combined 29,724 tickets in the pot, the lottery for the 2022Western States 100was a tight one. If a runner doesn’t have an automatic entry, a sponsor spot, or a golden ticket, the chance of getting their name pulled is slim – but never none. Just look atCat Bradley: she gained entry into the 2017 race with only one ticket in the hat, so it can be done! Eighteen of the entrants had 128 tickets, years of qualifying races and waiting to get into the historic race. Since fewer runners than usual participated in the 2021 race, the race organization was able to obtain a permit to allow a few more runners in this year: 385 rather than the regular 369. To start, 56 overseas rollover spots will be given to international runners who were selected for but not able to travel to the 2021 race due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With 164 automatic entrants, that leaves 221 spots for the lottery. Here’s a link to the2022 Western States 100 entrants list(which is not yet complete at the time of this article’s publishing but should be soon, according to the race organization, as all entrants finalize their registration). Let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into the Western States 100 so far, whether via automatic entry or by the lottery itself. The top-10 finishers of 2021are invitedto return for 2022, and for the men, all but two —Jim WalmsleyandStephen Kersh, first and seventh in 2021, respectively — have elected to do so.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Below are some speedy men and women who have already achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methodsso far, or as an international rollover due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As mentioned earlier, the race organization awarded automatic entry to 164 runners this year, and there were 56 overseas rollovers. We share the means by which each of these automatic entrants received their entry. Men Women A total of 221 names were drawn during the lottery, and among them were a small number of athletes who could crack the top 10 on the right day. Men Women Full lottery and waitlist results. A total of 75 people were chosen for the 2022 race waitlist. There’s a chance that these fast folks from the waitlist could get into the race. Men Women Full lottery and waitlist results. Withsevensix Hoka Golden Ticket Racesthis year —threetwo international and four in the United States — many top runners will be vying for the automatic spots awarded to the top-two male and female finishers of each race. Should runners decline their Golden Ticket, it can roll down as far as fourth place. In a notable turn of events, on January 25, 2022, the Tarawera 100k, a Golden Ticket Race, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 26, the Western States 100 race organization announced that the final two Golden Ticket Races of this series, the Black Canyon 100k and Canyons 100k, would each award golden tickets to the top-three male and female finishers. Here’s who’s gained entry so far via this mechanism: Men Arlen Glick, 2021 Javelina Jundred Mile Champion, earned a Golden Ticket for the 2022 Western States 100.

2022 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all the runners who were chosen for the 2022Hardrock 100! Well known in the ultramarathon world as one of the most difficult 100-mile events, Hardrock also has one of the most difficult lotteries to enter the run — in part because the qualifying races themselves are all notoriously challenging, and in part because there is usually only one way to gain automatic entry: you have to have won the previous year’s Hardrock 100 men’s or women’s event. A view from the top of Engineer Pass on the Hardrock 100 course. Photo: @garrettcreamer Due to COVID-19, there is a unique policy for automatic entrants for 2022. International runners who were chosen for the previous year’s event but were unable to travel in 2021 will gain an automatic entry. Eighteen international runners — 16 men and two women — were part of this auto-entry caveat. Historically, several runners are chosen ahead of time by the Run Director,Dale Garland, and announced among the names chosen in the lottery. The run organization indicated Garland chose six runners for 2022. The 2022 event will start 145 runners, and after subtracting the 18 international rollovers, the two returning champions, and Dale Garland’s six picks, that leaves a total of 119 runners chosen at this year’s lottery. The lottery for 2022 had 1,916 applicants. Your likelihood of getting into Hardrock depends on your number of tickets. TheHardrock 100 website’s lottery pageexplains the details and nuances here. As usual, the applicant pool is divided into the following three categories for the lottery and we list the number of runners chosen from each category for 2022: The lottery also carried out the Hardrock 100’s new Gender Equity Policy for the 2022 event, a policy voted on by the event’s board in 2021 that requires the percent of women on the start line to be at least the percent of women who applied for the lottery. For the 2022 lottery, 18% of the applicants were women, so 18% would be 26 women. There were 27 women selected in the lottery for 2022. In addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into six separate division- and gender-specific waitlists. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is, in reality, competitive in nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which Hardrock prides itself upon. In the rest of this article, we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist with a reasonable chance to get in. As stated before, the only usual way to gain automatic entry to Hardrock is by winning: two-time winnerSabrina Stanleywill be back to defend her title.

2021 Ultra-Trail Cape Town Results: An American Sweep by Dauwalter and Walmsley,"It was an American sweep atop the podium at the 2021Ultra-Trail Cape Town (UTCT)in South Africa whereCourtney DauwalterandJim Walmsleywon without challenge from the rest of their respective fields, but certainly faced the challenges of the race’s unforgiving terrain. The 97-kilometer (60-mile) course features some 4,560 meters (15,000 feet) of vertical gain as it makes its way amongst the famed trails in and around Cape Town. Runners reach the race’s high point of about 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above sea level in the race’s first quarter, with the route alternating between technical, rock-laced terrain and more runnable trails. The race began at 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday, November 27, in the dark and fog and with temperatures around 15 degrees Celsius (60 Fahrenheit). On the higher terrain, fog, mist, rain, and high winds kept everyone attentive while down lower conditions abated. Cloud cover moderated the temperature to a high of about 21 Celsius (70 Fahrenheit), but high humidity followed runners from start to finish. Win, lose, or draw, you can always count on the USA’sCourtney Dauwalterto be smiling, and that’s what happened as she dominated the women’s race. After some early race back-and-forths, Dauwalter settled into the lead by the second aid station of Kloofnek at 20 kilometers into the race. Machine like, her lead only grew at nearly every checkpoint from there such that she finished with an almost one-hour lead. Dauwalter’s run looks to be the second-best all-time women’s performance at UTCT. In the race for the rest of the women’s podium,Marianne Hoganof Canada made the strongest bid.

For the race’s first half, Walmsley, Italy’sAndreas Reiterer, and France’sSébastien Spehlerleapfrogged, at times running together or near to each other and at others accordioning out by a few minutes. It wasn’t until after the 50k mark where Walmsley started to gap the rest of the field, though it remained close for another 20k. However, when the top men arrived to Constantia Nek aid station for the second time at 70k, Walmsley was all alone with no other runners in sight for over 10 minutes. By the time he crossed the finish line back in Cape Town, it was nearly a half hour until second place Spehler rolled over the line and over 50 minutes until Reiterer completed the men’s podium. The race organization proclaimed Walmsley’s finish a new UTCT course record, besting the 2017 effort ofProdigal Khumaloat 9:50:00 by about 3.5 minutes.

2021 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: Victories for Hillary Allen and Hannes Namberger," At midnight on Saturday, November 20, the 2021Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) started from the coastal village of Porto Moniz on the island’s northwest coast, and headed uphill into the night. Some 14-plus hours of steep, technical, and often slippery trails later, interspersed with flat running along roads and the island’s famous levada trails (the pathways next to irrigation ditches), race leaders made their way out of the high country and down to the finish line in the port city of Machico, on the island’s southeast coast. All told, runners traveled 115 kilometers (72 miles) and climbed 7,200 meters (23,600 feet). With that midnight start and the seven hours of night running that followed, runners experienced cold temperatures in the high terrain as well as more temperate conditions down low. Dawn broke on Saturday morning to clear skies, in both the low and high country. In the afternoon, as the leaders traveled the race’s final 20 kilometers at low altitude, the temperature rose but was moderated by cloud cover, fog, and even a couple rain showers. Despite cool temperatures, runners reported feeling the effects of the high humidity. All in all, the weather was quite good for race day. This course played to the strengths of vert-loverHillary Allen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and she leaned into it to exact a commanding women’s win. Allen stayed in the lead virtually all race, and while the gap was as large as 40 minutes and as small as nine, Allen’s fitness shined. After a long journey to health following a near-fatal fall several years ago and its residual effects on her body, Allen’s win was a sweet one. Hannes Namberger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) blew everyone out of the water in the men’s race, finishing first in 14:00:36, and over 40 minutes ahead of his second-place competitor. While Namberger was among the lead men all race, he didn’t make substantial gains on the rest of the field until the climb to the highest points of the race after halfway. But then, he simply ran away with it, and scored the biggest win of his trail running and ultrarunning career yet. The start of the 2021 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail. All photos: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Though the women’s race had a smaller lead pack and fewer switcheroos than the men’s, which we’ll learn about later in this article, it was exciting and down to the wire nonetheless. AmericanHillary Allen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) moved into the lead by the top of the first major climb at Fanal, 14 kilometers into the race. She is well known for her climbing abilities and her prowess showed throughout this course as she continued to build a lead from there to the 42-kilometer mark. Russia’sEkaterina Mityaeva(post-race interview) also ran strong from the start. Though she was solidly behind Allen throughout the first half of the race, she also consistently gained time on the rest of the field through halfway. While NorwegianKirsten Amundsgård(post-race interview) was fourth at Fanal, she moved — for the first time — into podium position just after Rosario at 42k, with AmericanSabrina Stanley(pre-race interview) giving chase right behind in fourth, andSophie Grant, who is from New Zealand but lives in Europe, solidly in fifth place. Hillary Allen took the lead early and stayed there throughout the race. Here she runs below the village of Chão da Ribiera around 23 kilometers into the race. About an hour after dawn, the top women rolled into Curral das Freiras, 60 kilometers in. At a point of low elevation right before the brutal climb to the island’s highest terrain, this was the time for the women to gather their strength. Allen remained in the lead, but Mityaeva gained on her, leaving only nine minutes between them as they headed uphill. Right before the climb, the top five places remained the same. But that was about to change: Stanley went strongly through the race’s hardest section, gained time on the field from Pico Ruivo at 76 kilometers to Poiso at 90 kilometers, and moved into podium position. Sabrina Stanley hits the marathon mark at the edge of the village of Rosario before dawn. From this point, the race was on: at Poiso, the race course continues its dive steeply downhill, and it seemed all of the top women had plenty of legs left to run. In fact, Allen, Mityaeva, and Stanley in first through third places bombed downhill at almost the exact same pace, despite not running side by side, which speaks not only to their fitness but their competitive spirits as well. As they say, it isn’t over till it’s over! At 104 kilometers just after Larano, Allen had extended her lead to over 30 minutes, and Stanley was gaining on Mityaeva, at this point only six minutes behind. But Amundsgård was gaining too, decreasing her gap to Stanley to only four minutes. It was Allen who pulled off the win, cruising across the finish line looking ecstatic, nearly 40 minutes ahead of the field. As for the rest of the women’s top five, it really wasn’t over until it was over. Amundsgård raged in the final 16 kilometers, moving from fourth place all the way into second. Mityaeva crossed the finish line just about a minute later to round out the women’s podium. Stanley experienced physical problems starting before the 100-kilometer mark that caused her to slow down and ultimately finish fourth. Rounding out the top five was France’sEmily Vaudan, who ran smartly in the women’s top 10 for most of the race before moving into fifth position before the 100-kilometer point. Ekaterina Mityaeva makes her way to the top of Pico do Arieiro. Full results. Hillary Allen, 2021 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail champion. The men’s race for the lead was tight for a number of kilometers. At Fanal, 14 kilometers into the race and at the top of the first major climb, the top-11 men ran within one minute of each other, and even more trailed behind in a long train of chasers. By the bottom of that descent, however, at Chão da Ribiera, 23 kilometers into the race, the lead pack was cut down to only six. Things got a little more interesting around Rosario at 42 kilometers, after yet another brutal climb and descent. Here, three men shared the lead: NorwegianErik-Sebastian Krogvig, France’sBeñat Marmissolle, and Germany’sHannes Namberger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). They headed into the next two more gradual climbs with Italy’sDaniel Jungand France’sHugo Deckhot on their tails. Hannes Namberger on his way to winning the 2021 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail. Up until this point, runners were still traversing the island in the dark. The men spent some time reeling each other in or dropping off in the high country as the sun began to rise, and as they rolled into one of the lower points of the course at Curral das Freiras, the 60-kilometer mark, the fatigue and effort began to show. Namberger and Marmissolle managed to hang on to each other in the lead, and asked the crowd how close third place was behind them. Krogvig came in soon after, despondent about a twice-rolled ankle that would eventually mean an early end to his day. Early pace pushers Jung and Deck also dropped from the race. Switzerland’sJean-Philippe Tschumi(post-race interview) rolled in right behind and was only 10.5 minutes off the lead in third. The ever-smilingDmitri Mityaev(post-race interview) of Russia came in only two minutes behind Tschumi in fourth, and began another big climb looking very fresh. Another Russian,Aleksei Tolstenko, came in after to round out the top five. Dmitry Mityaev, all smiles as always, on Pico do Arieiro. The climb from Curral das Freiras to the high country gains about 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) in only 10 kilometers. This climb to Pico Ruivo, the high point of the course and the whole of Madeira Island, and then the traverse to Pico do Arieiro is extremely technical and completely blew apart the men’s field. On the climb alone, Namberger gained an eight-minute lead on then second-place Marmissolle. We got to see runners on Pico do Arieiro, the 76 kilometer mark, and nearly all of them said some version of “this is really hard” – or at least looked like they were thinking it. From here, the course descends way down, and the field stretched out even more until we saw runners once again at Portela at 99 kilometers. At this point the course is extremely runnable, and it was clear who had legs to cruise and who didn’t. In a bit of a switch up, Marmissolle wasn’t to be seen in the top five: Mityaev had made up a huge amount of time and was in second, Tschumi was only a few minutes back, Tolstenko just behind him, and Romania’sRobert Hajnalhad cracked into the top five. And with a long downhill route to the finish, peppered with flat stretches, Namberger put a huge gap on the field to win, all smiles, in 14:00:36. Second through fifth positions held to the finish as well, though Mityaev and Tschumi leap frogged each other several times before sorting back out to second and third respectively. Jean-Philippe Tschumi puts in the effort on the ascent to Pico do Areeio at 76 kilometers. Full results.

"2021 Javelina Jundred Mile Results: Arlen Glick, Camille Herron Win in the Desert","The 19th edition of theJavelina Jundred Milekicked off Saturday morning, October 30, sending runners through five grueling loops of Arizona desert trail totaling 100 miles, just in time for Halloween. The Javelina Jundred starts at the McDowell Mountain Regional Park, north of Fountain Hills, Arizona, about an hour outside of Phoenix. Runners took off at 6 a.m. on a 22.3-mile loop including the Escondido Trail on the park’s far eastern side, and then four consecutive 19.45-mile loops that combine the Pemberton, Shallmo, and Cinch trails. The 100-mile race served as a 2022Western States 100Golden Ticket Race, earning automatic entry for the top-two male and female runners. A cool, dark start yielded hot daytime temperatures before night brought cool reprieve once again, with daytime highs cresting above 85 degrees Fahrenheit. As is the case each year, the Aravaipa Running race organization hosted a huge Halloween party that went all day Saturday, though the night, and into the race’s closing hours on Sunday morning. The 2021 Javelina Jundred Mile scene. Photo: Javelina Jundred Camille Herroncame out of the gate at a screaming pace and kept it up throughout all 100 miles of the Javelina Jundred. By the 22-mile mark, Herron had pulled out a nearly 10-minute lead, which she built upon throughout the race. Herron crossed the finish line at 14:03:23, more than 90 minutes in front of the nearest chaser.Brittany Petersonfinished second at 15:47:23. Peterson stayed within 30 minutes of Herron for more than half of the race. But after 61 miles, Herron began steadily gaining on the field at a pace that no one could match. It appears Herron set a huge new course record by nearly 50 minutes as well. Tessa ChesserandLotti Zeilerran a close race for third and fourth. Zeiler stayed in front for the first 5o miles. After that, she and Chesser battled with each other for the lead for 20 miles until Chesser began to break away at around 70 miles. Chesser maintained her lead for the race, finishing at 16:25:05. Zeiler finished about 25 minutes later at 16:50:12. Melissa Brizicrounded out the top five, quite a bit back in 18:25:26. While Herron earned Golden Ticket entry to the 2022 Western States 100, Peterson already has an entry courtesy of her top-10 finish at the race’s 2021 edition. The Golden Ticket, thus, rolled down to third-place Chesser. Women’s Top-Five Finishers: Full results. Camille Herron on her way to winning the 2021 Javelina Jundred Mile.

Glick and Montgomery ran a close race from the start. Glick carved out a narrow lead at the beginning of the race that he held for the first 20 or so miles. By mile 22, Montgomery closed the gap and pressed ahead by several seconds. However, Glick was back in front by mile 32. Montgomery was still able to regain the lead for a short time as the pair approached the 40-mile mark. After that, Glick was able to get out in front by a few minutes, and held that lead through the end of the race, gaining slowly but steadily on the rest of the field.

2021 Grand Trail des Templiers Results: Ruth Croft and Jon Albon Win,"The 2021Grand Trail des Templiersstarted with its typical red flares and music blazing into a frosty, dark, October morning — this year perhaps buoyed by the extra energy of the race’s three-year absence due to bad weather and the COVID-19 pandemic. This 81 kilometer (50-mile) event, which takes place in Millau, France, climbs some 3,690 meters (12,100 feet) but does so over largely runnable terrain. The event has long attracted international competition as well as many of its home nation’s trail stars. This combination results in a really fast race with dynamic competition between runners from start to finish. This year saw just-below-freezing temperatures and clear skies for the 5:15 a.m. start. Soon after dawn, it became an outrageously perfect fall day in southern France. Afternoon temperatures reached about 16 degrees Celsius (62 degrees Fahrenheit), literally perfect running weather. The U.K.’sJonathan Albon(post-race interview) won the men’s race by seven minutes, but he put five of those minutes on second place in the race’s final 11k, so the men’s race for the podium was really tight for the majority of the race – nearly 70k – before spreading out a bit at the end. This was Albon’s debut at Les Templiers. New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took the race out easy, moved up into the lead mid-race, and distanced herself significantly from the rest of the field late to earn her second win of Les Templiers. Thanks toVert.Runfor sponsoring our coverage of Les Templiers. The start of the 2021 Grand Trail des Templiers. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Les Templiers is always a fast-moving race — blink and you’ll miss it — and this year was no exception. As far as 35 kilometers into the race, the top-eight men were still running within a minute of each other! But let’s back up to the beginning. When we spotted the leaders at 10k, 21k, and 35k, it was the usual suspects up front, including two-time defending championSébastien Spehler(pre-race interview) of France, the U.K.’sJonathan Albon(post-race interview) andRobbie Simpson,Petter Engdahlof Sweden, as well as France’sSebastien Capus. Also there, but at the back of this group, was multi-time second-place finisherNicolas Martin(pre-race interview) of France going out a little easier in his trademark style. The early men’s leaders of the 2021 Les Templiers. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At 49k, it was still a tight race for the top-six men, where they passed us within six minutes of each other. Martin had crept up into third position at this point, with only Albon and Spehler ahead of him. Things were shaping up for a very interesting last 30k of racing for the concentrated group in the men’s field. At 70k, and with 11k of the course’s most challenging terrain left to run, Albon led the field by just over two minutes. He didn’t stop at the aid station, asked about how close behind his second-place competitor was, and charged ahead. It seemed he might have reason to worry as Spehler was right behind and also moving well. Now, enter France’sBenoît Cori, who had moved up from the second half of the top 10 into podium position; like Spehler, Cori’s a two-time Les Templiers champion. Jonathan Albon, 2021 Les Templiers champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell But Albon excels on technical terrain, and the burly final 11k was his bread and butter. He continued to gap the field until he crossed the finish line back in Millau as the 2021 champion in his debut at Les Templiers. Spehler and Cori held their positions to complete the men’s podium. Martin ran a strong race all day, finishing his ninth run of Les Templiers in fourth place. Engdahl rounded out the men’s top five, in what also looked like solid start-to-finish effort.

Benedikt Hoffmann moved up into the men’s top 10 late in the race. Photo: Vert.Run/Kirsten Kortebein It was not a surprise to anyone who follows trail and ultrarunning that Spain’sGemma Arenas(pre-race interview) was the women’s pacesetter for most of the race’s first 35 kilometers. In fact, I think we all might have been concerned if she wasn’t there. It looked like Arenas was putting in a solid effort to run in the lead. At 10k into the race, where we got our first glimpse of the field as they flew through the dark forest, immediately behind Arenas were FrenchwomenJulie RouxandFiona Porte. Also in the mix for about the top-seven women through 21k were 2017 Les Templiers championRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of New Zealand and South Africa’sMeg Mackenzie(pre-race interview), both taking what looked like a more relaxed start. Ruth Croft, 2021 Les Templiers Champion. Photo: Vert.Run/Kirsten Kortebein At 35k into the race, however, things changed. Here, Croft, who looked ridiculously chill, moved up to take over the race lead. Arenas and Roux settled into second and third positions immediately behind her, which they would both hold through the finish line. Just 14k later, at 49k, Croft was a full six minutes up on any other woman, having created a significant gap, which stayed the same over the next 21k. But in the race’s final 11k, Croft broke fully away from the rest of the field, moving efficiently over the course’s most burly section. When she crossed the finish line for the win back in Millau, it was a long 20 minutes until second place arrived. While Arenas seemed to slow a bit over the last 11k, Roux charged hard both on the steep uphills and downhills. With 11k to run, Arenas held a 6.5-minute lead on Roux, but by the finish, her lead had shrunk to just 80 seconds. Give these women another two kilometers to race and things would have ended up mighty interesting. But close only counts in horseshoes, so Arenas held for second place while Roux took third. Porte andEsther Eustache, of France, had super strong days, settling into fourth and fifth places respectively by about halfway through the race and holding steady in those positions through the finish.

Road Runner and Ultrarunner CJ Albertson Led the 2021 Boston Marathon for 20 Miles,"As they say in endurance running, anything can happen. Today, road runner and ultrarunnerCJ Albertsonfinished 10th overall at the 2021Boston Marathonin 2:11:44. With that time, the runner also notched second place among American bidders, and narrowly missed setting a new personal best for the distance. But the real story here is about how the Fresno, California-based 28-year-old courted global attention by dominating the first 20 miles of this morning’s race. For three-quarters of the 125thBoston Marathon, Albertson maintained a big lead over the competition. CJ Albertson runs with an enormous gap on the rest of the men just four minutes into the 2021 Boston Marathon. Image is a screenshot of the NBC Sports livestream courtesy of Billy Yang. Albertson, a road runner and track and cross-country coach with a 2:11 marathon PR, first caught the attention of the ultrarunning world in 2020 when he set the then all-surface 50-kilometer world best of 2:42:30 on a track. That world best was since bettered in 2021 by Ethiopia’sKetema Negasato 2:42:07. As the gun fired on the 125th edition of the Boston Marathon, the first time the race has taken place since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Albertson took the immediate lead. The ultrarunner split the first 5 kilometers in 14:29 or 4:40 minutes-per-mile pace and the first 10k in 29:32 or 4:51 per-mile pace, charging ahead of the field. By the half-marathon mark, he held a 2:13-minute lead over the rest of the field, passing through in 1:04:08. It was a brash effort, to be sure. From the half-marathon mark to 20 miles, however, the chase pack gained on Albertson such that his lead shrunk to 23 seconds. By 21 miles in, Albertson was fully engulfed by the huge chase pack. The chase pack of men eventually caught CJ Albertson after the 20-mile mark of the 2021 Boston Marathon. Image is a screenshot of the NBC Sports livestream courtesy of Billy Yang. In the end, it was an all East African podium, with Kenya’sBenson Kiprutocharging hard after the 20-mile mark to dominate the field and win by 45 seconds in 2:09:51, withLemi BerhanuandJemalYimer, both of Ethiopia, taking second and third with a one-second disparity between the two. Albertson fought hard in those final miles to maintain a top-10 position. In that time, he was passed by fellow AmericanColin Benniewho would finish seventh and first American in 2:11:26. Ultimately, Albertson crossed the line in 10th and said in an interview at the finish, “Realistically, if I was 10th, that is good for me.” This unique Boston Marathon Monday date of October 11 is also Albertson’s birthday. Now, that was quite the way to celebrate a birthday. Be sure to also read ourin-depth interviewwith Albertson on his Boston performance.

"2021 Marathon des Sables Results: El Morabity Brothers, Aziza Raji Dazzle","After a 2.5-year break due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was with great anticipation that the 2021Marathon des Sablestook place this week. The famous desert race, which runs in the Sahara Desert of Morocco, travels 155 miles (250 kilometers) over seven days, traversing sand dunes and stone-filled plains in an arid climate where midday temperatures easily reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). Each day, a mobile bivouac is erected in the desert, which serves as the day’s finish line, campground for the night, and the following day’s starting line. There are six stages total, and five of them are competitive stages. The final stage is an untimed charity stage. Participants must carry their own equipment including food, camping materials, and survival gear along with water rations supplied by the race organization. Typically, the race takes place in April, which is spring in the Sahara Desert. This October edition was said to be hotter and drier than usual for this race and this time of the year. In addition to the heat, a stomach virus ravaged many of the participants. By the end of the week, dropouts amounted to over 40% of all starters, an unusually high rate for this particular race. Sadly, the race claimed the life of one runner due to cardiac arrest. The French man, in his 50s, was an experienced ultrarunner who had met the medical requirements necessary to start the race. iRunFarcovered this storyearlier in the week. For the first three days of the 2021 edition, it looked like parity might define the race. Moroccan brothersRachid El Morabityand the youngerMohamedEl Morabityran close together, leading the rest of the men’s field by just minutes. On the women’s side, Morocco’sAziza Rajiheld a bigger, but not insurmountable, half-hour lead overAicha Omrani(France) andHassna Hamdouch(Morocco) in second and third. The stage was set for shakeups in the grueling 50-mile Stage 4. However, Raji and the El Morabity brothers were about to render the outcome academic. At the end of Stage 4, just 15 minutes separated Rachid and Mohamed El Morabity from each other in first and second overall — but the rest of the field lagged behind by over an hour. Meanwhile, Raji had built her lead over the women’s field from less than an hour to a mind-boggling four-plus hours. Scenery at the 2021 Marathon des Sables. Photo: Cimbaly_MDS2021@FOddoux In the end, Rachid El Morabity took the win, finishing with a time of 21:17:32. Mohamed took a narrow second in 21:32:12, less than 15 minutes behind his older brother. This marks Rachid El Morabity’s eighth win of this iconic sand race, and Mohamed El Morabity’s fourth 2nd place behind his brother. Merile Robert(France) was the lone non-Moroccan on the men’s podium, a position with which he’s familiar. This marks his fifth Marathon des Sables finish, with his top previous finish also third behind the El Morabity brothers in 2018. Aziz Yachou(Morocco) took fourth place, less than two minutes out of podium position, in what was an incredible breakout performance. According to his social media, Yachou received an hour’s penalty during the race due to losing an item of his required kit, which makes this podium near miss even more fascinating. (Required kit and the penalties for missing or losing items are clearly communicated by the race organization before the race.) Mathieu Blanchard(France, lives in Canada) rounded out the top five, though he was a distant two hours and 20 minutes behind fourth place. He said on social media he suffered the stomach virus during Stage 4. Blanchard has had quite the 2021, following up his third place at the 2021 UTMB with this performance. Here are the top five men’s finishers: Full results. Notably, 10-time Marathon des Sables winner and Moroccan sand running legendLahcen Ahansalfinished ninth in the age 50-59 category with a time of 38:16:32.

"2021 Run Rabbit Run 100 Results: Dave Stevens, Addie Bracy Win","The 2021Run Rabbit Run 100 Milekicked off at noon Friday, pitting runners against a grueling course packed full of arduous climbs and monstrous descents through the mountains surrounding Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Unique in the ultrarunning world, Run Rabbit Run has two divisions: elite “Hares” and everyday-runner “Tortoises.” While anyone may enter either division, the Hare division has specific stipulations — the cutoff time is shorter, runners may not use poles or pacers, and are ineligible for Tortoise awards. The high-altitude race attracts some of the best ultrarunners in the nation — in no small part due to the total $75,000 in prize money to be disbursed among top finishers in the Hare division. The course includes climbs of the 10,568-foot Mount Werner, Buffalo Pass, and Emerald Mountain, for a total of 22,000 feet of elevation gain. With autumn weather well underway in Steamboat Springs, and frigid night temperatures crushing spirits, many runners opted to drop at the 50-mile mark, Olympian Hall, also one of the lowest points of the course. Many who had previously been in competitive spots till this point dropped out, includingKyle Pietari,champion of the 2019 men’s Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile, andSarah Keyes. Lead male runners began streaming across the finish line a little more than 18 hours after setting off from Steamboat Springs, while women began finishing after 20 hours elapsed.

Bracy established a pace early on that saw her consistently ahead of the competition and finish with a 37-minute lead overAlissa St Laurent, who crossed the finish line in second place at 21:01:18. Bracy finished about seven minutes behind the course record time of 20:16:54, set in 2013 byMichele Yates.Emily Caldwellcame across the finish in third at 21:19:18, 18 minutes behind St Laurent.

Dave Stevenswas the first to cross the finish line with a time of 18:01:45, after what had been a tight run with second-place finisherAnthony Costales, who crossed the line a bit more than 38 minutes later at 18:39:51. The pair stuck within a few minutes of each other for most of the race. Stevens was up by about three minutes at the seventh checkpoint, but pulled ahead by 10 minutes into the eighth, and continued to pull ahead until the finish. Jeff Mogaverocrossed the line in third place at 18:48:00, just more than 46 minutes behind the winning pace, followed closely byNick Coury, who finished a quick 34 seconds later in a sprint to the finish (as fast as one can sprint after running 100 miles)!

2021 UTMB Results: D’haene Earns Fourth Win and Dauwalter a Course Record,"This year’sUTMBsaw a French sweep on the men’s side and a new course record on the women’s side.François D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of France won the men’s race, his fourth win of UTMB, and the USA’sCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) topped the podium for the women, breaking the women’s record, previously held byRory Bosio, set on a shorter course in 2013. The 171.5-kilometer (106.5-mile) race makes a beautiful yet brutal loop around the Alps with Mont Blanc at the center, passing through France, Italy, and Switzerland, while beginning and ending at Chamonix, France. Starting with 2,347 runners at 5 p.m. on Friday, August 27, just a bit smaller of a field than normal, the crowd was just as huge, with spectators ecstatic at the return of one of the most competitive trail ultramarathons in the world after a COVID-19-induced hiatus in 2020. In a race with near-perfect weather conditions, competitors did not have to contend with the rain, hail, and high winds that sometimes plague the high mountain passes. D’haene and Dauwalter were both dominant, each leading their respective events for more than half of the race after steadily moving up from the gun. But it was a race of attrition for many, which saw multiple high-profile racers drop out, includingJim Walmsley,Xavier Thévenard(pre-race interview),Tim Tollefson(pre-race interview),Dmitry Mitayev,Tom Owens(pre-race interview),Beth Pascall,Maite Maiora(pre-race interview),Audrey Tanguy, andRagna Debats, many of them dropping out in the middle of the night as fatigue and the cumulative effect of difficult terrain set in. This was also a race of incredible breakout and solid perseverance in front of the challenges of 100 miles. The balance of the men’s podium saw breakout performances fromAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(post-race interview)andMathieu Blanchard(post-race interview). And on the women’s podium was emerging starCamille Bruyas(post-race interview) in second and the ever-strongMimmi Kotka(post-race interview) in third. With the rest of this article, we’ll dive deep into how the men’s and the women’s races played out. You can also check out our2021 UTMB photo galleryfor another look at the event. A special thanks toAltrafor making our coverage of UTMB possible! Thanks also toSquirrel’s Nut ButterandBUFFfor their support of our UTMB coverage. The Saint-Gervais aid station during the 2021 UTMB. All photos: iRunFar With one of the most competitive line-ups in UTMB history, this year’s race could have been anyone’s game. Though a few high profile women did not start, the race was still full of talent. With previous champions, veteran talent, and new-to-UTMB-ers, this race could have been a close one. But as we see time and again in 100-mile races, stomachs are unpredictable, small niggles turn into major injuries, and the mountainous terrain over 20-plus hours can derail the healthiest runners with even the best preparation. That’s exactly what happened in the 2021 women’s UTMB. There was a huge number of high profile dropouts, the majority happening in the safety of the large Courmayeur checkpoint, at about 81 kilometers, a little less than halfway into the race. These eliminations allowed a number of other women to step up, leading to a number of great performances from previously lesser-known competitors. The lead pack of women start to spread out at Les Houches, eight kilometers into the 2021 UTMB. The first 50 kilometers of the race were fairly relaxed and uneventful. By the time the women rolled into Les Houches, they had settled into their comfort zones and were mentally preparing for the long day ahead.Courtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), in her classic style, was out front, only a minute behind the men’s lead pack, and third through eighth places were only 90 seconds behind her. This pack included the American living in FranceKatie Schide(pre-race interview), France’sCamille Bruyas(post-race interview),Beth Pascall(pre-race interview) of the U.K.,Audrey Tanguy(pre-race interview) of France, andRagna Debats(pre-race interview) who is Dutch but lives in Spain. By the 20-kilometer mark, the Swede living in ChamonixMimmi Kotka(post-race interview) had moved up to join them. Coming into the 31-kilometer mark at Les Contamines, Kotka entered before Dauwalter, but the latter had a shorter aid-station stop, quickly refilling her pack and moving on. Bruyas was also under the shelter at the same time, making short work of her refuel. Fourth- through 10th-place women were all within eight minutes of the lead, still a very tight race. This aid station marked the first significant and emotional moment of the day, Tanguy was suffering severe stomach cramps, and dropped from the race here. After dodging a traffic jam of goats and pushing through dense fog, the women summited one of the largest passes of the day, Col du Bonhomme, 43 kilometers into the race. Dauwalter continued to lead with Kotka close behind. This is when the field started to stretch out a bit, with Bruyas about 11 minutes back, and France’sMarion Delespierrein 10th, about 19 minutes back. It was clear the strain the previous climb of 1,160 meters (3,800 feet) had taken a toll on some. Now well into the night, runners’ headlamps lit up the mountainside as they descended to the 50-kilometer mark at Les Chapieux. Now past the marathon distance and starting the next big climb, it was here that runners needed to summon their focus and fortitude. Third-place finisher Mimmi Kotka powers through the night after a fall. Dauwalter and Kotka continued to run a tight and fast race, both looking chill and composed in Lac Combal at 66 kilometers into the adventure, by this point over 20 minutes ahead of Bruyas and anyone else. Deslespierre andLuzia Buehlerof Switzerland moved steadily, but others were suffering —Hillary Allendropped out of the race near here, though it’s unclear why. Most made it up and over the Mount Favre summit after that, but after the long and steep descent, many decided to call it a day in the safe haven of Courmayeur, a little less than halfway into the race. Notable drops here included Pascall,Brittany Peterson,Kelly Wolf, andFrancesca Canepa, whose ailments ranged from a turned stomach to straight-up exhaustion. Other women took extended aid-station stops, including Dauwalter, who spent over six minutes here. Running over one of the tallest points of the course, Grand Col Ferret, at just over 102 kilometers, runners once again had to push through thick fog, donning jackets,hats, andglovesto keep their core warm over the high-elevation pass. By this time, Kotka had given significant space to Dauwalter, trailing 17 minutes back, but still looking very comfortable. Dauwalter never really throws down a dramatic pace, but she is like a freight train. She gains momentum and just moves up steadily, further and further the longer the race, and her experience is very apparent after the 100-kilometer mark of nearly every race she runs — including this year’s UTMB. Coming into Champex-Lac, some 125 kilometers into the race leaving less than 50 kilometers left to run, Dauwalter was now in the top 10 overall, the course record well within her reach. From here on out, the places and distance between top women stayed relatively the same, with notable drops fromAilsa Macdonald, who had been running very strong in the top 10 for much of the race, andDelphine Avenier. By Trient, as runners loped past the pretty pink church, Bruyas came closer to Kotka, who herself was now one hour back from Dauwalter. Bruyas looked comfortable, while Kotka looked like she was already in a decent amount of pain from her knees, which were bloodied sometime before 66 kilometers into the race. Though there were two major climbs left, it seemed by now the top-five places were set: Delespierre in fourth was two hours back from the lead, and Buehler in fifth another 45 minutes back from her. 2021 UTMB winner, now two-time champion, Courtney Dauwalter runs to the finish line. While there were no surprises in the end, it was a gritty finish for many. Dauwalter ran down the packed streets of Chamonix to huge cheers from the crowd – and for good reason. Finishing in an amazing 22:30:54, she ran the fastest time by a woman on the full course, a record previously set in 2013 byRory Bosio, on a course three kilometers shorter, and without the Pyramides Calcaires climb in Italy. Dauwalter was all smiles, striding into her historic finish. Bruyas followed her an hour and a half later, with a bit of a limp but also smiling, holding back tears in an emotional finish. Kotka followed another hour after that, limping in obvious pain, but finishing with extreme grit and grace. To round out the top five, Delespierre and Buehler — the latter a big surprise as she wasn’t on our pre-race radar for such a high level performance — both had great races. Just like in the back half of the men’s top 10, that of the women’s was super dynamic, with women constantly coming and going from the group from start to finish. When all 171.5 kilometers had passed, it was France’sMaryline NakacheandLucie Jamsinin sixth and seventh, Schide in eighth,Claudia Trempsfrom Spain in ninth, and the Zimbabwean living in the U.S.Emily Hawgoodin 10th. Camille Bruyas clasps her hands together in an emotional second-place finish at the 2021 UTMB. Full results. Luzia Buehler worked her way steadily throughout the day, gaining time and places, eventually finishing fifth. The 2021 UTMB men’s race started like every edition of this event: a huge group of men go off like a rocket and run it out together for the flat to rolling eight kilometers to Chamonix’s neighbor village, Les Houches. Call it a warm-up, call it settling the nerves, call it a little road race, call it whatever you want, but it’s always fun to watch. And sure enough, some 30 minutes after the start, the men’s train steamrolled through Les Houches and headed for the hills. While this race would certainly become controlled and then dominated byFrançois D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), there were some early and middle players who kept this race entertaining from the start. Enter the likes of SpaniardJordi Gamito, Russia’sDmitry Mityaev(pre-race interview), AustralianMorgan Pilley, PeruvianRemigio Huaman, AmericanJim Walmsley(pre-race interview), and — get this — eventual second-place finisherAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(post-race interview) of France. A huge pack of men run into Les Houches, eight kilometers into the 2021 UTMB. All photos: iRunFar Early on, it seemed that several of these men took turns in the lead and setting the pace. But as early pacesetting in a 100 miler goes, well, let’s just say that it doesn’t always go. And, in this case, all of the men on this list save for Dunand-Pallaz were DNFs by halfway through the event. Of all these runners, it was Walmsley who hung closest to the front the longest, running in second through nearly 90 kilometers into the event before dropping back and out of the race entirely. It will be interesting to hear Walmsley’s take on his day, because from the outside looking in, he seemed so much more calm and tempered this year than in previous editions, and that made him seem like a contender for the win. However, there was that helluva’ run at the 2021 Western States 100 two months ago and the injury he dealt with before that, as well as a host of other possible issues in the 100-mile distance. Breakout second-place finisher Aurélien Dunand-Pallaz runs through the night. So when everything shook out sometime after halfway through the race, there was D’haene putting on yet another masterclass performance in running mountain 100 milers. Over the race’s middle third, he built a small lead on his chasers that going into the end of the event, which was neither added to nor subtracted from in any meaningful way. We’ve seen and written this with D’haene so many times before: he breaks a lead and then moves with the necessary efficiency needed to maintain it. It sounds so simple, but anyone who runs 100 milers knows it isn’t. This is a honed skill. In his pre-race interview with us, he said that he runs UTMB when he feels the passion for it, which helps to explain the gaps between his showings here in2012,2014,2017, and 2021. Quite honestly, that passion was on full display at the finish line, where the sometimes reserved D’haene let his smile open into a huge grin and where he embraced his family and friends as well as his many fans in celebration. It seems like these big 100 milers always have a breakout story, and this race has two of them in the men’s second- and third-place finishers, Dunand-Pallaz andMathieu Blanchard(post-race interview) who is from France but who lives in Canada. While their end results were similar, the pair took different trails to success. For Dunand-Pallaz, it was pressing early, very close to the leaders. And for Blanchard, it looked like intentionally sitting back for the first marathon, letting the hot starters take it out, and waiting for the field to come back to him. Around the marathon mark, Blanchard slipped into the top 10, where he’d stay for the balance of the race. At the finish line, many miles and much effort later, the joy each showed for their breakout performance was a pleasure to watch. Mathieu Blanchard finishing third at the 2021 UTMB. What can we say about fourth-place finisher and first master, France’sLudovic Pommeret? The2016 UTMB championis now 46 years of age and he was absolute magic to watch. For the race’s first half, he did some grade-A lurking, hanging out between 11th and 20th places, always within reach of the top 10. There seemed to be a few spells throughout the race where he looked a little rough, but then he came back each time. Starting around halfway, he made his way into the top 10 and stayed there for the balance of the race. Picture-perfect racing! Another Frenchman in the top five, and this time it’sGermain Grangierwho returned from his tie for ninth place in 2019 to nab a top-five spot for 2021. Grangier’s strategy felt evident from the start: get out, stay mixed up with those leading or close to it, and hang there as long as possible. I loved wondering each time we saw him if he was going to hold his higher positioning in the field this year over the last race edition, and he even gave us a bit of a stir where he starting dropping back in the race’s final third. Though he may have run as high as second place at times, he ultimately finished fifth. The back half of the men’s top 10 was ever dynamic, shifting over and over again. In the end, it was Germany’sHannes Nambergerin sixth, France’sGregoire Curmerand Switzerland’sDiego Pazostied for seventh, France’sMathieu Clémentin ninth, and Hong Kong’sHo Chung Wongin 10th. 2021 UTMB champion François D’Haene raises his fist in celebration.

2021 CCC Results: Molist and Garrivier Win,"The 2021CCCrace started Friday at 9 a.m. and the top runners finished the 100k race later that same day. The course runs from Courmayeur, Italy through Champex, Switzerland and to Chamonix, France while picking up 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) of elevation gain. It’s similar toTDS, but goes an opposite direction for a shorter distance and less elevation. Women Nine and a half hours into the raceMarta Molist(Spain) pulled even withPetra Ševčíková(Czech Republic), and then sped to the finish. Molist was the race winner in 12:50 and was absolutely ecstatic at the finish. Abby Hall(USA) also overtook Ševčíková for second, finishing in 13:04, and Ševčíková was third in 13:21. The race marked a big step up for all three of the podium finishers. Earlier, Molist was 15th at the 2019IAUTrail World Championships, and Hall was 14th at this year’sWestern States 100.Ševčíková might’ve made the biggest leap. Little is known about this Czech skyrunning star, but perhaps our readers can help. The top-three women of the 2021 CCC race celebrate (l-to-r): 2. Abby Hall, 1. Marta Molist, and 3. Petra Ševčíková.

He gained the lead near 60k and ran from the front the rest of the way. The win marked a comeback from a year-long injury cycle, and a step up from his 2019 runner-up finish. Garrivier dedicated the victory to the still not-yet-identified Czech runner who died in TDS earlier in the week. Garrivier’s time betteredHayden Hawks’s10:24 run from 2017 for a new course record. 2019UTMBthird-placerScott Hawker(New Zealand) was second in an emotional 10:47 finish, andThibaut Baronian(France) was third in 10:53.

2021 OCC Results: Albon and L’Hirondel Set Course Records,"When it comes toUTMBand its group of races, even a shorter distance 55k crosses countries.OCC, named for its Orsières, Champex, Chamonix linkup, raced from Switzerland to France and the common finish in crowd-filled Chamonix. And while only 55k (34.2 miles), OCC doesn’t lack for challenge at all. The race course gains an impressive 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) on its point-to-point path. Men Jonathan Albon(U.K.) escapedRobbie Simpson(U.K.) for the win in 5:02, a new course and event record. Simpson was less than three minutes back at 5:05 for runner-up honors. It was quite a comeback for Albon, though certainly not a surprise given his earlier Skyrunning success. The obstacle-course-racer-turned-mountain-runner had been away from the sport for almost two years, enduring a foot surgery and moving into the Norwegian mountains. He did however win the 45kFjällmaratonrace in Sweden just weeks ago as part of his prep for OCC. Jonathan Albon, 2021 OCC champion. Photo: UTMB/Laurent Salino In second, Simpson, a longtime mountain runner who crosses over into road marathons too, matched his finish place fromSierre-Zinalearlier this month. Petter Engdahl(Sweden) was third in 5:08 andThomas Cardin(France) was fourth in 5:14. All of the top-four finishers betteredStian Angermund’s2019 winning time. Currently listed as fifth,Hayden Hawks(USA) entered an aid station from the wrong direction, possibly after a wrong turn, and there was some speculation that this may result in a time penalty. It was mentioned that the same situation may impact other runners. However, it appears no penalties were given. The rest of the men’s top 10 includes: 5 –Hayden Hawks(USA) – 5:206 –Nicolas Martin(France) – 5:217 –Peter Fraňo(Slovakia) – 5:278 –Antoine Charvolin(France) – 5:289 –Kevin Vermeulen(France) – 5:2910 –Moritz Auf Der Heide(Germany) – 5:33 Women The men’s race might’ve been close, butBlandine L’Hirondel(France) greatly outclassed the women’s field. Two hours into the race she was already eight minutes ahead of eventual second-placerMathilde Sagnes(France). L’Hirondel’s 5:45 finish was a five-minute improvement onRuth Croft‘swinning time from 2019 and is the fastest time in the race’s history. L’Hirondel has been an active racer in recent years and was fourth at Sierre-Zinal earlier this month. Fun fact, both L’Hirondel and Albon were 2019 Trail World Champions together too. A full 22 minutes back of the race winner, Sagnes finished second in 6:07. Third-placeCaitlin Fielder(New Zealand) closed hard for a 6:10 finish, making up five minutes on Sagnes in the final section. The 2021 OCC women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Mathilde Sagnes, 1.

"2021 TDS Results: Krogvig and Bohard Win, Tragedy Strikes Race","It’sUTMBfestivalweek and races are happening all week long.TDSstarted on Tuesday, August 24 and went 145 kilometers (90 miles) from Courmayeur, Italy to Chamonix, France. It’s one of the most challenging courses of the week with 9,100 meters (29,855 feet) of elevation gain. The race was first known as Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, and 2019 marked its first year on the new, longer course. This year’s edition was marked by tragedy which beset a runner from the Czech Republic when they died due to injuries sustained in a fall during a technical descent around 62.5 kilometers into the race. iRunFaris covering the story in a separate article. Our hearts are with the loved ones of this runner and all those affected by the accident. We grieve with you. As a result of the accident, the race was halted for almost all the runners behind the accident scene, and the race continued for those who had passed the location prior to and immediately following the accident. Lead men and women arrived back to a muted, more-solemn-than-usual scene at the finish line in Chamonix, out of respect for the lost runner. Some top runners arrived to the finish not knowing about the earlier accident or only finding out right before finishing, and a number of runners offered their thoughts and condolences at the finish line. The start of the 2021 TDS race in Courmayeur, Italy on Tuesday, August 24 at 3:30 p.m. Photo: UTMB Women Manon Bohard(France) won the race in 23:11. At Hauteluce, 97k into the contest, Bohard trailed longtime leaderEkaterina Mityaeva(Russia) by three minutes. Just 15k later and after a big climb, Bohard had turned that into a 19-minute lead and then increased it the rest of the way. The finish time was well back ofAudrey Tanguy‘s21:36 win in 2019. Fun fact, Manon Bohard is the daughter of the inaugural TDS men’s race winner,Patrick Bohard, back in 2009. Bohard was second at the FrenchTrail des Passerelles du Monteynard65k in July. Giuditta Turini(Italy) overtook Mityaeva too, making that pass after the 121k checkpoint, and finished second in 24:11, andIldikó Wermescher(Hungary) finished in third in 24:29, barely two minutes ahead of Mityaeva. Mityaeva, the 2019 UTMB fourth placer, finished fourth here, too, in 24:31. Manon Bohard of France, the women’s champion, high fives spectators at the TDS finish line.

Fellow AmericansMeredith EdwardsandCamelia Mayfielddropped from the race near 67k and 36k, respectively. Edwards fell before 50k and hurt her leg, and Mayfield entered the race while trying to overcome injury. Men Third at the 2021Lavaredo Ultra Trailin June, and also in 2017,Erik-Sebastian Krogvig(Norway) earned a big win at TDS with an 18:49 finish. As Krogvig reached Chamonix and the finish line, he spun his hydration pack around and slammed it to the ground, then turning to the crowd and flexing his arms in a celebration. A short while later, he cheered “Yes yes yes,” on his social media, also sharing that he didn’t learn of the race’s tragedy until after he finished. As in the women’s race, the 2019 course record held. Also as in the women’s race, Krogvig was second before beginning the big climb after 100k. There he turned a three-minute deficit at the bottom into a 10-minute lead at the next checkpoint. Unlike in the women’s race though, Krogvig’s chief rival late into the race,Benoit Girondel(France) didn’t surrender any additional positions, or even any extra minutes, after falling behind on that climb.

2021 Leadville 100 Mile Results: Hughes and Macdonald Win,"On Saturday morning at 4 a.m., theLeadville 100 Milebegan in downtown Leadville, Colorado, where 678 runners left the starting line to run 100 miles through the Rocky Mountains. The front of the race was tight from the get-go with champions and first-timers all vying for first place through the first few aid stations. The men’s finishers came into the finish starting at around 8 p.m. Saturday night, with the women’s top finishers arriving starting at 1 a.m. The rest of the field will finish by the 30-hour cutoff mark, 10 a.m. Sunday morning. Runners line the edge of Turquoise Lake in the early miles of the 2021 Leadville 100 Mile. Photo: Life Time/Leadville Race Series The Leadville 100 race route gains just under 16,000 feet, with the lowest point at 9,200 feet, and the highest point at Hope Pass at 12,600 feet. The out-and-back route runs 50 miles into the mountains and then returns back to downtown Leadville. The high elevation can pose challenges for competitors in addition to the mountains’ unpredictable weather. This year, the weather remained cool with scattered afternoon showers, typical in the high country. The Leadville Trail 100 Mile began in 1983 after the town’s main employer, the Climax Mine, closed doors and Lake County skyrocketed to the highest unemployment rate in the country. The “Race Across the Sky” was dreamed up as an idea to bring an economy back to Lake County. The first year, 45 runners made the journey into the mountains for 100 miles and since then, thousands have done the same, and this small mountain town has become known for the iconic event. Afternoon storms dotted the 2021 Leadville 100 course, though skies eventually cleared by evening. Photo: Meredith Terranova Adrian Macdonald, a first-time 100-mile competitor, came out of the halfway point at Winfield in the first place and held strong the whole second half. He finished first with a time of 16:18:19, with a sub-10-minute mile average pace for the whole race. By two-thirds of the way through the race, Macdonald had gapped the rest of the men’s field and continued to gain on the other men until he finished more than 40 minutes ahead of second place. The Fort Collins, Colorado, resident has successfully crossed over to trail ultramarathons from collegiate and road running, having only finished his first 50 miler earlier this year. Macdonald was paced in the last section by multi-time Leadville 100 podium finisherNick Clark.

The race wasn’t decided among this trio until the race’s final miles, with Flaherty passing Sharman with roughly 20 miles to go and then Krupicka with less than 10 miles left in the race. Krupicka ultimately crossed the line in third, 10 minutes behind Flaherty, to round out the men’s podium. While Krupicka’s return to ultrarunning following a more-than-half-decade break from the sport caught the attention of many, Flaherty also made a mark with great pacing on what we believe is his first 100-mile finish in a long trail-ultrarunning career. 2021 Leadville 100 Men’s Results Adrian Macdonald celebrating after winning the 2021 Leadville 100 Mile with pacer Nick Clark. Photo: Life Time/Leadville Race Series The women’s field remained tight for a long portion of the race, with 23-year-oldAnnie Hughes, from Leadville, Colorado, a first-time Leadville 100 Mile competitor taking the lead by the second aid station at mile 23.5. She remained in first the rest of the race with a lead growing from 10 minutes to exactly an hour by the finish. Hughes ran track and cross-country in college before moving to Leadville and discovering ultrarunning. She has set the women’s supported fastest known time on the 160-mile Collegiate Loop, took second overall at the 2021Mace’s Hideout 100 Mile, and will compete in the 2021Moab 240Milelater this fall.

"2021 Badwater 135 Results: McRae Wins First Women’s Title, Lewis Gains Second Men’s Win","On Monday night, the 44thBadwater 135 Milekicked off in Death Valley, California. In a field headlined by former male champs and women vying to become first-time winners, the first finishers rolled across the finish line at Whitney Portal, California, on Tuesday night. The race started in three waves at 8:00 p.m., 9:30 p.m., and 11:00 p.m Monday night, and the full field will cross the finish line before the 48-hour cutoff on Wednesday evening. The Badwater 135 covers three mountain ranges for a total of 14,600 feet (4,450 meters) of cumulative vertical ascent and 6,100 feet (1,859 meters) of cumulative descent. Course conditions figured to be especially severe this year, as heat waves continue to rake the American West. As I write this sentence, the heat index in Death Valley is 117 degreesFahrenheit; at Whitney Portal, it’s 100 degrees. Harvey Lewis, 2021 Badwater 135 men’s champion. Photo: Badwater 135 In a field stacked with previous race winners, 45-year-oldHarvey Lewispulled off his second Badwater 135 victory. The Ohioan spent most of the race in a three-man weave with UkrainianIgor Gotsuliakand RussianSergey Ionov, who took second and third, respectively. Lewis checked in almost an hour behind Gotsuliak for the lead at mile 90 but blistered past the Ukrainian to take a one-hour lead by mile 122. He’d previously won the event in 2014, and this was his 10th finish and fifth podium. The lead pack distanced itself from a loaded field. In addition to Lewis, three other Badwater winners returned in 2021 with four total gold medals between them.Michele Gragliawon in 2018,Pete Kostelnickwon in 2015 and 2016, andOswaldo Lopezwon in 2011. Kostelnick was especially hot in 2016 when he set the men’s 20-29 age-group record with a 21:56:32. However, he didn’t finish in 2021, dropping out between miles 90 and 122. Graglia was also a DNF. And Lopezfinished this year’s event in 10th place with a time of 31:46:04.

2021 Hardrock 100 Results: A Course Record for D’Haene and a Near Miss for Stanley,"In a historic year at theHardrock 100, the top-three men all broke the previous counterclockwise course record of 23:28:00 set byKilian Jornetin 2015.François D’Haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Dylan Bowman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), andRyan Smithfilled the podium, all finishing before sunrise on a beautiful Saturday morning, with D’Haene exactly one hour ahead of Bowman. What’s more, D’Haene’s time was also the fastest time ever run on the course, bettering even Jornet’s clockwise record of 22:41:33 run in 2014. Returning championSabrina Stanley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) missedDiana Finkel’swomen’s course record of 27:18:24 set in 2009 by less than four minutes, running a strong and gutsy race throughout in her trademark style.Courtney Dauwalterled for much of the race until she was forced to drop out of her Hardrock debut due to stomach issues, leaving an open path for Stanley to the finish.Darcy Piceu(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andMeghan Hicks(post-race interview) rounded out the women’s podium. More broadly, after a two-year absence, runners were raring to go for 26th Hardrock, held on July 16 through 18, 2021 in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. The race had been canceled in 2019 because of snow and avalanche danger, and in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. That meant that all of the runners making their Hardrock debuts were originally drawn to run the 2019 race and, then, waited more than two-and-a-half years to push themselves physically and mentally in one of the hardest mountain races in the world. Runners leaving the town of Silverton, Colorado, at the start of the 2021 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Olivia Rissland Runners making their way up the first climb less than one mile in with Courtney Dauwalter leading this pack. Photo: iRunFar/Olivia RisslandWith a 48-hour limit, many runners are pushed to their breaking point, whether due to the 33,000 feet in cumulative elevation gain, the punishing average of 11,000 feet in altitude, or the inability to keep food down after a full day (or two) of hard work. The 100.5-mile loop takes runners through Silverton, Ouray, Telluride, and across the mountains and valleys in-between: even attempting to complete the course is an accomplishment in and of itself. The 2021 Hardrock presented almost ideal conditions for runners: minimal snow on the course, as well as cool conditions and some rain and thunder but no hellacious hail or lightning. In the alpine tundra, women and men commented on the fields of wildflowers, blooming just at the right time to provide runners with a nice vista to ease the inevitable physical pain that comes with running 100-plus miles.

Until after Burrows aid station, about one-third of the way through the race, eventual second- and third-place finishersDylan BowmanandRyan Smithhung on tight, staying within five minutes of D’Haene. But once the French athlete picked up his first pacer, the speedy Jim Walmsley, he began to put distance between himself and the rest of the field: a distance that only lengthened as the race progressed. Early on in the race, the fourth- through 10-place men ran within one hour of each other with that group including 2018 championJeff Browningand FrenchmanJulien Chorier, but that distance lengthened as night fell. By the time runners arrived at the Telluride aid station at mile 72.8, Chorier was in fourth with a comfortable 34-minute lead on Browning. By KT aid station at mile 89.1,Troy HowardandNick Pedatellawere running neck and neck for sixth and seventh places, withTrevor Fuchsclose behind, and only two miles ahead, Browning pulled cemented himself into fifth position.

D’haene not only bested the counterclockwise record, but Jornet’s overall record of 22:41:33  set in 2014.

In signature style,Sabrina Stanleywent out in front — she made it clear in herpre-race interviewthat she was here not only to win, but to break the women’s course record (previously set byDiana Finkelin 2009, 27:18:24). First-time HardrockerCourtney Dauwalter(pre-race interview) moved up steadily, and by the Maggie Gulch aid station at mile 15.4, she and Stanley were running neck and neck. Past the 50k mark at the Burrows aid station, Dauwalter had put a 32-minute lead on Stanley and kept that distance through Ouray. Unfortunately, Dauwalter experienced stomach issues even earlier and was unable to keep any food or fluids down. She looked in good spirits heading out of Ouray, but dropped at mile 62 along Camp Bird Road after that, unable to continue. Sabrina Stanley leads the women’s race at Maggie Gulch. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Stanley pushed on through the last section of the course through darkness, and it looked for a time she may have the course record in hand, running nine minutes under the old record by the last climb at mile 93. She pushed hard and ran strong to finish in 27:21:49, the second fastest women’s time ever. With Dauwalter out of the race after Ouray, it was a race for the final two spots on the podium. Hardrock legendDarcy Piceu(pre-raceinterview) looked smooth and happy throughout the race, met by her daughter at multiple aid stations, sitting for a few minutes and gulping down ramen and ginger ale. At Ouray, Piceu had an almost two-hour lead onMeghan Hicksof iRunFar (in fourth prior to Dauwalter’s drop), but Hicks threw the hammer down and flew down descents according to her pacers, and shortened that lead to 46 minutes at the final aid station, Putnam Basin at mile 94.7.

Piceu’s runner-up finish means in all eight of her Hardrock starts, she’s finished first or second place, and incredible accomplishment with her remarking after the race that was the hardest one yet! Hicks rounded out the women’s podium, greatly improving on her previous two Hardrock’s (2015 as seventh woman in 39:02:58, and 2016 as fifth woman in 34:25:25) by finishing third in 33:05:02.

2021 Western States 100 Results,"After a year’s hiatus, the big dance, the 2021Western States 100, was back for its 100-mile journey on the historic Western States Trail in California. For many runners, it was the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to line up with a deep and competitive field, and relative fitness levels were unknown. Some racers had made a point of trying to run a spring tune-up race, while others used the break from racing as an opportunity to focus on long training blocks with only Strava runs as indicators of their form. Based on the competitive and exciting racing by both the women and the men, neither form nor racing memory suffered from the pandemic. The lack of snow in the high country set the course up for a fast run this year, but the heat played certain spoiler. What began as a mild day in the higher reaches of the Sierra Nevada turned into a broiler afternoon with the official high temperature on the course soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In the end, it was the U.K.’sBeth Pascall(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andJim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) who weathered the elements better than everyone else, taking home respective victories. In the women’s race, third-placeRagna Debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) set an incredible new masters course record by over half an hour, breakingAnn Trason’srecord which had stood for 19 years. But this year’s race was a story for the ages in so many more ways, so let’s dig in. A special thanks toDrymaxfor once again making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible! Thanks also toBUFF®andHOKA ONE ONEfor their support of our Western States coverage. For a bit more before we get to iRunFar’s post-race interviews, we’ve published finishing and finish-line race-organization interview videos with thewomen’s podiumandmen’s podiumfinishers. If you enjoyed our weeks of Western States coverage and our in-depth reporting from the course, please consider supporting iRunFar. Whether it’sa reccurring monthly pledgeora one-time contribution, your support is invaluable in helping us do what we do! With three women inside the top-10 overall, some of the fastest times ever run on the course despite high heat, and tight competition wire to wire, the top-10 women changedWestern States 100history—and women’s ultrarunning history—this weekend. Numerous international women chose to make the trip to the States for States. Among them wereBeth Pascall(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) from the U.K., who’d spent the past 10 weeks in the U.S. after running theCanyons 100k.Ragna Debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who is from the Netherlands but who lives in Spain, was present, running her first Western States, as wasRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), all the way from New Zealand, lining up for her first attempt at 100 miles. On the domestic side, defending championClare Gallagher(pre-race interview),Brittany Peterson(pre-race interview),Addie Bracy,Camille Herron, and so many more women all hoped to have a good run. What ensued was tight racing from start to end with impressive performances all around. Beth Pascall leading the women at Robinson Flat (mile 30). All photos: iRunFar The race started under clear skies, a setting moon, and a comfortable 53 degrees Fahrenheit. Fast out of the gate, France’sAudrey Tanguywas the first over the Escarpment, mile 3.5, followed a minute back by Herron. Gallagher, Pascall, and Bracy filled out the top five just two minutes back from Tanguy. All the women received enthusiastic encouragement from the resident Yeti of Olympic Valley who’d come out to spectate. By Red Star Ridge at mile 15, Pascall had moved to the front. After finishing just off the podium in fourth in 2019, she was eager to move up in the final standings and wasted no time making her intentions known. Tanguy, Bracy, and Gallagher gave chase, all within 90 seconds, and a long string of women trailed just as closely behind. By Robinson Flat at mile 30, we understood that Pascall meant business. Looking relaxed, she’d moved to just three minutes off of course-record pace. Bracy and Debats continued to chase, holding the gap to within five minutes. In the next eight miles, Pascall went from three minutes over record pace to nine minutes under it. She flew in and out of the Dusty Corners aid station at mile 38 in a minute. Keely Henninger, Ruth Croft, and Brittany Peterson running through Robinson Flat. Halfway through, many of the top women were looking comfortable. Pascall even claimed that it didn’t feel too hot. Still, the heat must have been affecting her as she slowly lost some time on course-record pace. Debats continued a steady march forward, keeping the gap at a manageable size.Katie Asmuth(post-race interview), now running in third, received the award for the happiest runner through midway, and the one with the sunhatwith the most flair. By mile 61, Pascall had worked herself into 10th overall, but the full group of top-10 women were running within about 45 minutes of each other. And at 10.5 hours in, there were 19 women in the overall top 40, a testament to the depth and talent in the field. At mile 71, along the infamous Cal Street, the race was on. Pascall came through at 11:51, moving up to ninth overall with a fast transition. At just 14:15 back, Debats barely stopped at the aid station. Two minutes later, Asmuth ran through, only grabbing ice. Croft followed less than four minutes in arrears, and Peterson came through flying two minutes later. Tanguy left a mere four minutes after that. Count them! That’s six women within 27 minutes of each other almost three quarters of the way through a 100 miler. What, what? In the next 14 miles, Croft made her move, coming through Auburn Lake Trails, mile 85, in second, just 18 minutes down on Pascall, but only a mere two minutes up on determined Dabats. A charging Peterson moved by Asmuth. With the top-six women still within 45 minutes of each other at mile 85, there was plenty of racing to be done in the final miles. But no one could stop Pascall. Consistent from Olympic Valley to Auburn, she finished in 17:10:41, the second-fastest time in women’s history. She was also seventh overall, continually moving up through the field as the day wore on. Croft finished a strong second in the women’s field and ninth overall with a time of 17:33:48. Debats would hold on to finish third with a time of 17:41:13, putting three women into the top-10 overall. At 42 years of age, Debats’s incredible finish time marks a new women’s masters record, breaking the previous record of of 18:16:26, set byAnn Trasonin 2002. Ragna Debats with her daughter after finishing third at the 2021 Western States 100. This trio was followed by Peterson and Asmuth rounding out the top-five women. For the balance of the women’s top 10, sixth place was ultimately Tanguy, her first Western States finish. This year, seventh place belongs toEmily Hawgood, the Zimbabwean who lives in the U.S., and who has a charmer of a story. Hawgood ran three Golden Ticket races to gain Western States entry this year, achieving it on that third try. In eighth wasCamelia Mayfield, who follows up on her fifth-place finish in 2019 with another smartly run race in this gnarly year.Keely Henningergains the F9 bib in her debut 100 miler, and 10th place belongs to none other thanKaci Lickteig(pre-race interview), whose finish marks her seventh at this event. Together these 10 women finished within the top-21 overall. Let’s just pause a moment to let that significance soak in. And to bring this full circle, Gallagher and Herron crossed the line outside of the top 10, in 17th and and 26th respectively, having what had to have been individual vision quests of sorts. And Bracy threw in the towel at mile 62. Full results. It would have taken a lot to convince most everyone to bet againstJim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) this year. And yet some of us still somehow did, because Walmsley took an unconventional path to 2021 success. But we all should have known better. With many of the international men choosing not to make the trip over the various ponds, it was going to be a showdown of domestic talent. Listening to Walmsley talk before the race, it was clear he was in a good place mentally and physically. An IT band injury in the spring may have cut down on his training volume, but in the end, it may have ended up being a blessing in disguise. He went into the race with the experience of two previous well-executed States performances, and he surely drew on that knowledge to put together a smart and measured race from start to finish. Jim Walmsley leading the race at Michigan Bluff (mile 55). Hayden Hawks(pre-race interview), on the other hand, was making just his second attempt at the 100-mile distance. But after setting a course record at theJFK 50 Milelast fall and a solid block of training leading up to Western States, he was out to race and win.Jared Hazen(pre-race interview) was hoping that fourth time would be the charm for Western. After a third and a second in previous years, he hoped that a training block that started in February would deliver wining results. It didn’t take Walmsley long to make it the 3.5 miles up to the Escarpment. He was accompanied by Hawks and followed closely by Hazen. This order was entirely unsurprising given that all three men had the confidence to try to win the race. Early on at Red Star Ridge at mile 15, Hawks and Walmsley were already running three minutes under record pace, the lack of snow clearly saving them time. Hazen followed in third two minutes back with other race favoritesTim Tollefson(pre-race interview),Matt Daniels(pre-race interview), andMark Hammondclose on his heels. Just under an hour later at Duncan Canyon, Walmsley and Hawks had pushed the pace another four minutes under record pace, both running smooth at 24 miles in. By Robinson Flat at mile 30, Walmsley’s pace had become too much for Hawks. He passed through five minutes under course record pace and 45 seconds in front of Hawks. By this time, Tollefson, running toward his childhood home in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, had moved into third, just over 12 minutes back, looking very relaxed. Thirty seconds later, Hazen came through, unfortunately already looking decidedly rough. Sometime before mile 38, Walmsley had donned a bucket hat and continued to cruise at six minutes under record pace, slowly pulling away from the rest of the field. Hawks held the gap to just six minutes while Hazen and Tollefson joined forces nearly 17 minutes back. The likes ofAlex Nichols(pre-race interview),Drew Holmen(post-race interview), andMax Kingstayed close, just another seven minutes back. Drew Holmen working his way up at Michigan Bluff. By mile 50, Walmsley had put eight minutes into the course record. Maybe it was the bucket hat, but the only word to describe his appearance was relaxed. It was a full 26 minutes later before second place Hawks rolled through, still seemingly running within himself. Nichols led Tollefson through, both looking strong. Hazen continued to suffer, dropping back to fifth. By the time the leaders rolled through Foresthill at mile 62, it was 93 Fahrenheit in the shade, 97 in the sun, and time for the heat-management strategies to come into play. “It’s not the heat, it’s the hills,” said Hawks. And after that, he’d lose 10 minutes to Walmsley in the following five miles. He was now 48 minutes back and had Nichols to contend with who was slowly closing the gap. That ever-infamous Cal Street, stretching between Foresthill at mile 62 and the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78, is where the day started to catch up to Walmsley—but only a little bit. At the Cal 2 aid station, he’d given back his advantage on the course record. From there on out, he moved faster than everyone else behind him, but slower than a 2019 Walmsley. By Green Gate at mile 80, Walmsley was now five minutes over course-record pace. But Hawks came through a full 77 minutes back. A surging Holmen was just 11 minutes behind and didn’t even stop. This was his first attempt at 100 miles, and he’d clearly done his homework on pacing and patience.Tyler Green(post-race interview) was also close behind. With a 14th-place finish at Western States in 2019, Green was on a mission to do better. Tyler Green cooling off in the American River (mile 78). By the time Walmsley made it to Robie Point, just a mile to go, and with the course record now well off the table, he stopped for a Coke and walked the climb. He would continue to cruise the final mile in his bucket hat to win his third Western States in a row with a time of 14:46:01, still an incredible time for an excessively hot day. Behind him, the race for the podium stayed intense. Somewhere between Green Gate and Pointed Rocks at mile 94, Hawks disappeared from the front of the race, leaving Green in second place with Holmen chasing just six minutes back.Cody Lindfollowed in fourth and just 17 minutes back. At the end, Green would hold off Holmen with a time of 16:11:00 to take second, a massive jump up from his 2019 finish. Holmen completed the podium with a time of 16:23. Both had started off conservatively and had it pay off in the end. Lind would finish fourth in 16:49:40, an impressive run for his first 100 miler and first attempt at Western States. He clearly had insider’s knowledge as the son of two-time Western States finisherPaul Lindand the grandson of the event’s original medical directorDr. Bob Lind. (Read more on the Lind family legacy at the race.) Cody Lind finishing fourth in his debut at Western States. Tollefson rounded out the top-five men with a time of 16:55:49. He’d put off running Western until he felt ready to do the race justice, and clearly, he was ready. The fact that he’d grown up in the area and run the last miles of the course hundreds of times certainly paid off in the race’s most difficult miles. In the back half of the men’s top 10, we had sixth-placeKyle Pietari, who executed yet another well-played top-10 performance,Stephen Kersh(post-race interview) who finished seventh for the second time in a row after curiously bouncing around most of the top-10 positions over the course of the day, and Hawks who ultimately crossed the line in eighth place after experiencing physical struggles and a long stay at the mile 94 aid station to regroup. Among the day’s breakout runs was ninth placeKyle Curtin, who moved up into the top 10 late. And Nichols rounded out the top 10 in what looked like a difficult finish after an even more difficult day. To clear the air for those wondering, Daniels DNFed at mile 55. Hazen andJeff Browningleft the race at mile 62. And Hammond and King tapped out at mile 80. Full results.

2021 Hardrock Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2021Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run! This article breaks down the results of today’s lottery for the run’s 2021 edition. Let’s start with some statistics and background information. After two straight cancelations, this year’s lottery was quite different as “Nevers,” that is all runners who’ve never finished Hardrock, were rolled over from the 2019 Hardrock lottery, while “Veterans,” runners who’ve finished Hardrock five or more times, and “Everyone Else” (hereinafter “Else”), runners who’ve finished between one and four times (and a couple grandfathered exceptions), were freshly drawn for Hardrock 2021. With that in mind, there are 230 entrants in the lottery for next year’s Hardrock. There are 186 Else’s entered in the lottery (after accounting for the automatic entry of 2018 champsJeff BrowningandSabrina Stanley) with a total of 900 tickets, with the number of tickets for each runner allocated as one ticket for each of a runner’s finishes, one ticket for each of a runner’s DNSs since last starting, one ticket for applying, and tickets for various service criteria (full rules). Else’s with one ticket had a 7.9% chance of getting in while the one runner with 11 tickets had a 59.6% chance of getting in. The 44 entrants in the Veteran’s lottery had a total of 425 tickets with one ticket for each a runner’s finishes as well as for various service criteria. The eight Veteran holders of the minimum of five tickets had a 44.5% chance of getting in, while the lone Veteran with 27 tickets had a 95.6% chance of getting in. (Odds and total ticket numbers cited were calculated prior to one runner moving from Veteran to Else and another having a service ticket added. Those changes did not materially change the odds.) The 2021 event will start 145 runners. Those 145 starters will come from an original pool of 155 runners made up of 28 Veterans, 62 Elses, and 65 Nevers, a change from the previous mix of 33 Veterans, 45 Nevers, and 67 Elses. The first 10 runners to withdraw from the race will not be replaced from their respective categories waitlists. Replenishment of the field from the waitlists will being once the field is down to 145 runners. Historically, up to five runners were chosen ahead of time by the Run Director,Dale Garland, and announced among the names chosen in the lottery. There are no new Run Director picks in the 2021 lottery. In addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into three separate division-specific waitlists. For perspective, in 2018, 3 people got off the Veteran waitlist and into the race, 6 people from the Never waitlist, and 24 people from the Else waitlist. For the 2017 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrant spots 10 deep in the Veteran division, 9 deep in the Never division, and 6 deep in the Else division. For the 2016 edition, the waitlist went to 4 deep for the Veterans (which included all of the Veterans on the waitlist that year), 4 deep for Never, and 8 deep for Else. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is, in reality, competitive in nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which Hardrock prides itself upon. Below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2021 contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist with a reasonable chance to get in. The men’s race will feature 2018 championJeff Browningreturning to defend his title with two Hardrock debutants, 3-time UTMB championFrançois D’Haeneand 2-time Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji championDylan Bowman, likely being his main challengers. The 2018 women’s championSabrina Stanleyhas elected to use her auto-entry to return this year, and her closest competition with likely come from 2019 UTMB champCourtney Dauwalterwho excels in brutally difficult races, while three-time Hardrock championDarcy Piceuhas the best chance of joining them on the podium. There is only one way to gain an auto-entry into Hardrock, and that is by winning the prior Hardrock. Jeff Browning will be returning to defend his title in 2021. Rollover Men’s Entrants from December 2018 Lottery Below are the notable men who gained entrance via the 2018 lottery for the 2019 race, but, as Nevers or by winning the prior Hardrock, retained entry into the 2021 race.

2020 Transgrancanaria Results,"The 2020Transgrancanariacrowned a new champion in the women’s race with the USA’sKaytlyn Gerbin, who improved upon her second-place finish from last year. The women’s race for the podium was tighter than the men’s, with China’sFuzhao Xiangarriving in a strong second and Spain’sAzara Garcíain third, all three finishing within 17 minutes of each other. The men’s race saw a tie for the win between SpaniardsPau CapellandPablo Villa. For Capell it was his fourth-straight win at Transgrancanaria and for the pair it was a finish that mirrored a race they spent running together for the most part. The USA’sDylan Bowmanworked his way up throughout the race, eventually onto the men’s podium in third. This year’s 128-kilometer route was quite different from years past due to a couple necessary course changes, including because of damage to the previous course by a 2019 wildfire. What was the same, however, was the 11 p.m. local time Friday night start and the Saturday afternoon finish for the leaders. The weather was also quite typical for spring on the Canary Islands, with cool temperatures at night (we saw temperatures as cold as 4 degrees Celsius [39F] just before dawn) and, then, full sun and warm temperatures by day. And, you can’t forget that always-present island humidity. Thanks toVert.Runfor supporting our coverage of Transgrancanaria.

All photos: iRunFar/Bryon Powell A tie for the win!Pau Capell(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was simply the favorite among the group of top runners, with his three previous victories here plus the last couple years he’s had in mountain ultramarathons in general. But what’s so great about ultrarunning is that… it’s ultrarunning. There are hours and mountains and the night and the sun and so many variables that come into play. Oh, and there’sPablo Villa(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), too. The pair of Spaniards went off the start line and stuck among the lead group right away, at times setting the group’s pace. Also in that lead group was the USA’sJared Hazen(pre-race interview) and China’sPeiquan You. This foursome remained together until somewhere after the race’s marathon point, while a long string of men trailed behind them. At the race’s halfway point distance-wise, 64 kilometers in, Capell and Villa arrived as a pair in the lead, but only by two minutes because Hazen was still giving close chase. You was now out of the picture and he’d drop not long later. Unfortunately, the next 10 kilometers would take their toll on Hazen as he got off course and lost contact with the lead. From there, Hazen only fell back further in the field before ultimately dropping not long after. From 64 kilometers until the 128-kilometer finish, it was Capell and Villa running basically with or near each other. Here and there the pair separated by up to a few minutes, but they always seemed to come back together again. At the 110-kilometer aid station, when Capell was ready to leave a bit sooner than Villa, he waited. Clearly, they were now traveling as a unit and that’s how it would go all the way to the finish. Pablo Villa (left) and Pau Capell after tying for the win at the 2020 Transgrancanaria. Dylan Bowman(post-race interview) of the USA was the comeback kid of this race. After a rough year-plus health-wise with injury and physical issues, he’s back. He seemed to take things out a bit conservatively, but wanting to remain not too far off the leaders. It looked quite intentional, thus, that he hovered just outside the race’s top five for its first half. Bowman has raced Transgrancanaria before, and so he knows the difficult terrain that’s presented to runners about two thirds of the way through the race, the rough-and-tumble high volcanic section plus a long descent afterward. It was in this difficult stuff that Bowman moved up into third place, a position he’d hold until the finish. Dylan Bowman and Harry Jones leaving Artenara together at 64 kilometers into the race. Like Dylan Bowman, the U.K.’sHarry Joneshovered in relative contact with the leaders for many of the race’s early kilometers. Bowman and Jones even looked to have teamed up for some time mid-race. On the long descent from the high country, though, the pair spread out and Jones settled into fourth position. France’sLambert Santellialso had a strong race, like Bowman and Jones running a bit back from the lead but right around fifth position from very early on–and a position he’d be in at the finish. Lambert Santelli after finishing fifth. Full results. Gediminas Grinius running trough the town of Tejeda which is 74 kilometers into the race. Last year, the USA’sKaytlyn Gerbin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took second at Transgrancanaria. This year, she improved a spot to take the win and finished at the front of a relatively tight race for the podium and a fascinating race dynamic. Let’s dig in. It was actually Spain’sAzara García(post-race interview) who led out the women’s race with what felt like a quiet confidence. She was calm and direct in her aid-station stops with her crew, which made it look like the race was coming easy to her. The same seemed almost certain to be true for Gerbin, too, perhaps even more so. Here we also add to the mix France’sAudrey Tanguy(pre-race interview), who was helping to pace set near the front of the women’s race early on. So, we had García off the front pretty much straightaway, with Tanguy playing immediate chase through at least 27 kilometers into the race, where the pair passed through the aid station one-two and within one minute of each other. However, over the next 13 kilometers, García opened things up and no one was within 6.5 minutes of her at 40 kilometers in. As it turns out, this would be about her biggest lead because over the next 24 kilometers or so, Gerbin reduced her 11.5-minute time gap to García to just 1.5 minutes. A chase was on. Azara García leading the women’s race in Teror (28 kilometers). Around this same time, the race’s halfway point, Tanguy began to drop back from the very front of the race andFuzhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of China started to move up from her earlier position just outside the top five. However, there was a lot of racing to go as the women climbed up into, around, and down from Gran Canaria’s volcanic highlands, often where races are made or lost at Transgrancanaria. When the women came off the highlands, the race had a new leader in Gerbin, a position she’d hold through the finish line. And the podium race wasn’t yet decided either, as on the long descent to 110 kilometers, Xiang and García switched spots, into second and third positions, which they’d keep until the finish. As much as Gerbin, Xiang, and García kept a relatively tight race between them, they also blew apart the rest of the women’s field. With 20 kilometers to go, the lead-three women had had already created an hour-plus gap on fourth place and the rest of the women’s field, and they’d widen it to 90 minutes by the finish. This trio was certainly in their own performance universe today. Kaytlyn Gerbin after winning Transgrancanaria 2020. Fuzhao Xiang finishing in second. Tanguy slowed significantly in the race’s second half, but clearly used her strength to stay in the top five, ultimately taking fourth. Spain’sClàudia Trempsfinished fifth while running evenly within the middle to the back half of the top 10 all race long. With this finish, Tremps continues her ascendent efforts at mountain ultras over the last few years. Clàudia Tremps running in Tejeda (74 kilometers). Sweden’sMimmi Kotkafactored into the first half of the race when she was running just inside the top five. However, she would DNF following a painful fall. Full results.

2020 Western States 100 Lottery Results (Plus Additional Entries),"The lottery for the 2020Western States 100took place on Saturday December 7, 2019, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. However, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. This year’s lottery saw a 14% increase in applicants over last year, with a total of 6,664 runners applying for entry via the lottery. The starters list in June 2020 will ultimately contain 369 runners, a number set by the race’s permit through the Granite Chief Wilderness Area. Among this there will be 102automatic entrants(some decided and some yet to be decided, see below for details) and the remainder who were chosen in 2020 lottery. A change was announced to the WS 100 entrance process in 2016, and will be implemented for the fourth time in the 2020 event, a 50-person General Waitlist. If a registered entrant decides not to race, members of the waitlist will move onto the entrants list. Today, that waitlist was also filled from among the lottery entrants, as well. For perspective, the waitlists rolled down to allow the 36th and 31st runners to toe the line in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Here’s thefull 2020 Western States 100 entrants listand theseparate 2020 waitlist. Let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into WS 100 so far. The women’s top 10 from the 2019 Western States 100are invitedto return in 2020 as automatic entries, and eight of the 10 women have chosen to do so: The men’s top 10 from 2019are also invitedto return with auto-entries, and seven intend to do so: According to UltraSignup, 69 of the 102 auto-entry slots were filled ahead of the race, with 15 of those being top-10 returnees from last year. (Looking back, 19 of 20 eligible 2018 top-10 runners accepted their spot into the 2019 race.) Below are some speedy women and men who have already achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methodsso far: Women Men A total of 264 names were drawn during today’s lottery, and among them were a small number of athletes who could crack the top 10 on the right day. Men Tomokazu Ihara(Japan) andKyle Curtinare fifth and 17th on the waitlist, respectively, and likely to gain entry.Rod Farvardis 35th on the waitlist with his entry quite uncertain. Women Cass Chisholm(U.K.) is 45th on the waitlist and, therefore, is unlikely to get in. At the moment, athletes still have two ways to get into the 2020 Western States 100, via the Ultra-Trail World Tour and the Hoka One One Golden Ticket Races. TheUltra-Trail World Tour’s(UTWT’s) designated runners have been announced, and, as in recent years, the UTWT has designated four North American runners and six runners from further afield. Men’s UTWT Entries Women’s UTWT Entries The five-race 2020Hoka One One Golden Ticket Raceswill offer up to 20 WS 100 entries to be given to top finishers of these races. The top-two men and top-two women finishers of each race gain entry, and if they already have an entry or if they decline it, the entry can roll down as far as fifth place.

2019 The North Face 50 Mile Championships Results,"The 2019The North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Mile Championshipsis a day that will be remembered for its fast starts in both the men’s and women’s races, the fog that just kept clinging to the landscape and made for cool running conditions, and the to-the-wire shake-ups in both the women’s and men’s podium races. Through it all, Marin County localYiOu Wangand faraway FrenchmanSébastien Spehlerheld steady for the win. And chasing them from the Marin Headlands to the finish line across the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, it was Canada’sAnne-Marie Maddenand Colorado’sAddie Bracywho rounded out the women’s podium with the newly-moved-to-CaliforniaDarren Thomasand France’sThibaut Garriviercompleting the men’s top three.  A special thanks toThe North Facefor making our coverage of this race possible! Thanks, too, toBUFFfor supporting our coverage of the TNF 50. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The start of the 2019 The North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Mile Championships. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Though localYiOu Wang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) has performed so well at other 50 milers, including a pair of wins at the not-far-to-the-northLake Sonoma 50 Mile, she’d not yet nailed the TNF 50… until now. Let’s recap her dominant performance, which seemed to start with patience. In my mind, the early miles of the TNF 50 are tricky. It’s totally dark, the trails are super runnable in surface and yet windy and hilly and ever changing otherwise, and this year the fog was so thick that even headlamps were swallowed by the murk. Despite that, YiOu seemed to keep her calm in the fray of women, staying in contact with the lead but letting others set the pace. When the sun rose and the race strung out a little, this trend continued, with YiOu running within spitting distance of the lead. Things changed, however, as the race reached its halfway point miles-wise, at Stinson Beach and 27.4 miles into the race, where YiOu basically shared the lead. And then things changed a second time, where YiOu destrominated the rest of the field between there and our next vantage point, mile 33.5. There YiOu cruised, putting more than five minutes on everyone else in six miles. This is the trend YiOu held to the finish, where her 7:21 finishing time was 17 minutes better than everyone else. Her win was greeted with much jubilation in the local trail running community awaiting her in the historic Crissy Field. YiOu Wang, 2019 TNF 50 Mile champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Canada’sAnne-Marie Madden(post-race interview) has come to be a familiar face on the TNF 50 over the years. She said after the race that she loves this event and let’s face it, this race seems to love her, too. Anne-Marie’s M.O. was to run her own race despite what the rest of the field was doing, and that meant staying out of early racing packs and moving up in the race’s second half. She also said after the race that she surprised herself to arrive to about mile 30 in third place, feeling as strong as one can feel with 30 miles already in the legs. Anne-Marie held this position until the final descent at around mile 47 when she came uponAddie Bracy(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). After seeing in her in the distance for some miles before this, Anne-Marie decided to fight for second place, fueling up and hydrating before making a commanding pass. Addie, too, is a fighter and she didn’t go quietly. Anne-Marie really had to work for the extra dollars awarded by finishing second, the pair crossing the line only 90 seconds apart from each other. Anne-Marie Madden taking second at the 2019 TNF 50 Mile. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell If YiOu and Anne-Marie were the podium finishers who hung back a bit in the first part of the race, then Addie was one of the aggressors, pushing the pace and keeping the miles coming quickly. Though this course has been run just once before, in 2017–the race was canceled last year due to wildfire smoke–we hadIda Nilsson’scourse-record-establishing splits from then to compare this year to. The women’s frontrunners were right around course-record pace through Muir Beach on the outbound, 17.8 miles into the race. By Stinson Beach at mile 27.4, the women arrived about five minutes behind Ida’s 2017 run. Addie certainly wasn’t alone in pushing the women along, as in the early milesClare Gallagher(pre-race interview) andAnna Mae Flynn(pre-race interview) were there, too. However, the leaders dropped Clare first and Anna Mae later on, leaving Addie as the remaining early leader still amongst the fray. After the race she said she paid the price for her fast start, and indeed, she ceded first and second place, but ever the competitor, she put nose to the grindstone to hold onto third, crossing the line looking like she’d used all she had.

Just to see a few runners full circle, after her early push, Clare slowed but managed to hang strong in the back of the top 10 to finish eighth while Anna Mae Flynn was a DNF after midway. It also appears thatTaylor Nowlin, who we expected to feature in the race, dropped at some point, perhaps due to the flaring IT band she mentioned to us mid-race. Full results. Keely Henninger crossing the line in ninth place with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Going into the TNF 50, you had to think France’sSébastien Spehler(post-race interview) was coming in prepared to race for the win. I mean, he took second at the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile in April and so he was coming to California for the second time in seven months. Indeed, Seb was all business in leading the race from early on, using an almost-polar-opposite strategy from the women’s race winner. At miles 13, 17, 27, 33, 39, 43, and 47, he led. From the start to Stinson Beach at mile 27.4, Seb set roughly the same pace as 2017 champion Tim Freriks, but after that he slowed relative to Tim. But despite him slowing relative to Tim’s course-record-establishing run, Seb still looked strong and gained significantly on the field. From miles 27.4 to 33.5, he put more than five minutes on everyone. And from miles 33.5 to 39.5, he increased his lead to 14 minutes. It seemed like the game was almost over. Then it all changed, and fast. We waited for Seb at mile 43.5 for quite a while, and we even thought we’d either somehow missed him among the runners from the event’s other simultaneous races or he’d somehow taken a wrong turn. Finally, he arrived, heavily favoring his left leg and looking like he was having a hard time. He would say after the race that he had cramps and pain, but that they abated on the final downhill and allowed him to run well to the finish. That said, between miles 39.5 and 47, Seb gave back eight minutes of his lead. Though he looked well when we spotted him at mile 47, we still couldn’t help but wonder what would happen in the final miles. Well, Seb crossed the line as the 2019 champion with plenty of daylight between him and the rest of the field. Funny thing was, because of simultaneous races and a man he could see in front of him from another race as well as a self-admitted language barrier, he didn’t know he’d won the race for a while afterward! Sébastien Spehler, 2019 TNF 50 Mile champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Now, let’s talk aboutDarren Thomas(post-race interview) and his second place. Simply said, I think we should have seen this one coming a bit more clearly than we did. The dude’s been pumping out super-strong performances in the last couple of years, such that the pump seemed primed for a breakout race on a big stage. In the race’s first miles, Darren featured in the lead group, shadowing other pace setters before settling in just 1.5 minutes off the lead at mile 16.8 and in sixth place. Though his gap to the lead increased by several minutes between there and Stinson Beach at mile 27.4, he stayed in the same sixth place. Then, on the long uphill after Stinson Beach, Darren caught and passed three men, moving himself into podium position by mile 33.5. He said after the race that uphills are a strength and passing other runners gave him motivation for forging forward. Suffice it to say that he wasn’t done moving forward and that he came upon France’sThibaut Garrivier(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) around mile 43.5, where he passed him also and moved into second place, finishing like he still had gas in the tank. Call it an incredibly impressive run and I certainly won’t be overlooking him in the future. Darren Thomas is so stoked with his second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Thibaut said before the race that the rolling and runnable terrain of the Marin Headlands would be a challenge for him, but that he’d trained especially for it, thought he would do well until the 50-kilometer point, and then who knows what would happen after that. What happened was that Thibaut also ran amongst the leaders and then in contact of the lead through mile 16.8, before lapsing back to the middle of the top 10 around the race’s halfway point. However, the steepest and most technical miles of the TNF 50 come in the middle of the race, and this terrain allowed Thibaut to use his strengths to move up from seventh place at mile 27.4 to fourth place at mile 39.5. From there he managed to move from fourth to second, but then was soon passed by Darren and bumped back to third, where he would stay to round out the men’s podium. Thibaut Garrivier makes his way in the mist on his way to third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks I can’t help but think of several similarities between the women’s and men’s races, the super-strong finishes of second places Anne-Marie Madden and Darren Thomas, the hang-on-and-hold-it third places of Addie Bracy and Thibaut Garrivier, and the wow runs of fourth places Abby Hall andDrew Holmen. A lot like Darren, Drew also seemed primed for a breakout race, and indeed he earned himself one with his fourth place which was only a minute and change out of podium position. Scotland’sRobbie Simpson(pre-race interview) crossed the line in fifth place, saying it was a difficult day in his debut ultramarathon but with a smile at the same time. To note, expected and early frontrunnerMatt Daniels(pre-race interview) was a late DNF. Full results. Anthony Costales took seventh at the 2019 TNF 50 Mile.

2019 UTMB Results,"The USA’sCourtney Dauwalterand Spain’sPau Capellwon the 2019UTMB, in doing so making the 170-kilometer/105-mile loop around the European Alps’s Mont-Blanc massif starting and finishing in Chamonix, France. The 2019 edition fired off on Friday, August 30 under stormy skies, as lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, and rain splattered up and down the Chamonix Valley. The race’s notoriously wet weather abated, though, and Mother Nature greeted most of the field–composed of 2,543 starters–with a warm evening, a comfortable first night, and a hot-and-humid Saturday. Saturday-afternoon thunderstorms returned around the course, bringing some runners a break from the heat. As far as we can tell, no modifications were made to the course due to weather for the front of the pack, as frequently happens at UTMB. Pau Capell’s dominant performance in the men’s race was followed up by the defending champion, France’sXavier Thévenard, taking second and New Zealand’sScott Hawkerbringing home bronze in what can only be described as a breakout performance. In the women’s race, Courtney Dauwalter was untouchable for the win, whileKristin Berglundbroke out equally big with her second place and Spain’s shorter-distance trail starMaite Maioratook third, proving she can run as well at longer trail ultramarathons as she does at shorter events. In the balance of this article, we report in-depth on how the men’s and women’s races played out. Don’t forget to have a look atour photo galleryfrom this year’s race.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The women’s race for the win was up in the air for some 90-plus kilometers. Off the start line, China’sMiao Yao, who has enormous talent and a growing trail resume which included winning last year’s CCC but was racing 100 miles for the first time, went out like a bullet. If any of the women in the field had contact with her in the race’s first half, it had to have been in the first couple hundred meters because at seven kilometers in she was already more than 1.5 minutes off the front and then at 20km in she was up to 9.5 minutes ahead of the field. Game on, Yao. China’s Miao Yao running in the lead about 66 kilometers into the 2019 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks In the race’s early hours, a long train of talented women strung out behind Yao, as we mentioned quite a distance from her but not so far apart from each other. That is, at 20km in, second and tenth places where just four minutes apart. Then at 43km, the gap was just 20 minutes between #2 and #10. But the UTMB’s marathon mark is one of several points in which this race gets interesting. That’s because runners are out in the deep night and the race’s most remote terrain, mostly off the grid in the mountains of Italy. A lot can and does happen out there! When we saw the women at about 66km, where they come out of that burly terrain and begin their approach to the relative mountain metropolis of Courmayeur, Italy, the women’s top 10 had strung out quite a lot and there had been some change-ups in who was in the frontrunner game. Yao remained steadily out front, with a 15-minute lead.Courtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had moved herself firmly into second position, and by firm I mean there was not only a gap between she and Yao in first but also between she andMimmi Kotkawho would run in third place for quite some time. A few other familiar faces were in place near the front, such as the U.K.’sBeth Pascall(pre-race interview)who’d finished fourth last year and who wasn’t shy in saying during her pre-race interview with us that she wanted to improve upon that effort. Courtney Dauwalter cresting the Grand Col Ferret during the 2019 UTMB. Photo: Trail Running Argentina/iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci It is said that UTMB ‘starts’ in Courmayeur, Italy, when the race reaches the 80km point. That is, to do well, you gotta’ turn up feeling strong at Courmayeur. Indeed, the race’s lead-three women all looked well there, with perhaps the smallest possible crack beginning in leader Yao’s armor as the time gap between she and Dauwalter had decreased by 2.5 minutes. Everything can shift on a dime in ultrarunning, and that’s exactly what happened next. In the 12km between Courmayeur and Refuge Bonatti, located high in on a ridgeline, Dauwalter assumed the lead, coming into the refuge with a 10-minute gap to Yao in second. Yao’s day spiraled hard downhill from there, as she would be a DNF due to physical problems less than 20km later in La Fouly. Suddenly, it was a whole new women’s race and its dominant force was Dauwalter. To be honest, the last quarter or so of this race looked hard for her. There was some real grin-and-bear-it action at times, she sending positivity out into the world but also no longer able to fully mask the effort’s difficulty. No matter what she looked like or said, however, the numbers never lied. Aid station by aid station she increased her lead such that by 153km in Vallorcine, after passing from Switzerland back to France, she’d accumulated an hour’s lead. This was a gap she’d maintain on the women’s field all the way back to the finish in Chamonix. Even though she had a hip injury that required time off from running this summer, she was a cut above the rest of the women’s field. It was with great admiration from an international crowd lining the streets of Chamonix that she was welcomed over the finish line as the 2019 UTMB champion. Courtney Dauwalter, 2019 UTMB champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I love these globally competitive races where runners who have been regionally or nationally successful in their home communities break out onto the international stage. Almost every one of these races has at least one, and this year’s women’s breakout isKristin Berglund(post-race interview) who took second place. Nearly all race, the Swede living in Austria featured in the women’s top 10, for a long time in the back half of it before picking her way through the pack in the race’s second half. There were inklings of how good she might do here based on her previous performances, including in taking fifth at this year’s Transvulcania Ultramarathon. But UTMB is 100 miles, and a tough 100 miles at that. Berglund made her second-place effort look like clockwork, though. She was reliable, strong, and fluid all night, all day, and all the way around Mont Blanc. Kristin Berglund on her way to taking second at the 2019 UTMB. Photo: Trail Running Argentina/iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci As the race’s kilometers waned, there was still plenty of racing to be done in the women’s field. One woman who had an incredible final-quarter surge was Spain’sMaite Maiora(post-race interview). With plenty of success in shorter-distance trail running to lean on but nothing beyond about the 100km distance, Maiora went out really easy, so easy she wasn’t even in the top 20 at 20km into the race. Fast forward something like 20 hours, most of the way around Mont Blanc, and in Vallorcine with less than 20km left to run, Maiora had surged into podium position and looked amazing. Though the women behind her weren’t too far off, Maiora held tight to that third place until the finish. Maite Maiora running her way into third place at her first 100 miler, the 2019 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Marissa Harris The remaining top-10 women fit into two clear categories: those who started very easy and moved up late, and those who put themselves into top-10 position right away and held it. In the former category, we have Russia’sEkaterina Mityaeva. Like several other top women’s finishers, Mityaeva was venturing into the 100-mile distance for the first time and so she was clearly employing the conservative-early strategy. At several of the later aid stations, she looked pretty tired to our field team. But if she was feeling the effort, she was still moving well relative to her competitors. Her relief was palpable at the finish line when she crossed in fourth place. Pascall,Katie Schide(post-race interview) who is an American living in Switzerland, andElise Delannoyfrom France fit in the category of featuring up front all day and finishing in the top 10. Pascall ultimately took fifth, a position lower than last year but what I’d call a definite performance improvement. Her 2018 and 2019 times are nearly identical, though the 2019 course was longer and had more climbing. Schide and Delannoy respectively took sixth and seventh. Now, let’s talk about the top-10 finishers who used the move-up-fast-and-hard-late strategy. AmericanRory Bosio(pre-race interview), two-time UTMB champion, didn’t feature in the women’s top 20 for at least 20km and the top 10 until the race’s final third. In addition to her all-day consistency, which led to an eighth-place finish, she provided entertainment out on the course for so many, hamming it up for her many fans, before sprinting to the finish to break 28 hours. Hungary’sIldikó Wermescherfinished in ninth in what had to be the day’s best example of pacing. She was 651st overall at 8km into the race–well out of the women’s top 20–and 129th overall as well as ninth woman at the finish. Tenth place was France’sDelphine Avenierwho squeaked into the top 10 in the race’s final kilometers. After featuring in the women’s podium race early, Kotka eventually finished in 20th. Several favorites didn’t make it to the finish, including defending championFrancesca Canepa(pre-race interview), last year’s second placeUxue Fraile(pre-race interview) of Spain, the USA’sKaci Lickteig, and the Brazilian living in SpainFernanda Maciel. Full results. Courtney Dauwalter running in Switzerland during the 2019 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Alright, let’s dive deep into how the men’s race played out. The men’s race featured an outstanding line-to-line performance for the win, many blow-ups, and all the entertainment of running 100 miles around the Mont Blanc massif. As you may have read in our men’s preview, Chamonix once again gathered some of the best male trail ultrarunners in the sport. On paper, as a three-time champ as well as the defending champ and the guy with the most victories at the UTMB festival of races, France’sXavier Thévenard(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was the clear man to beat. But the rest of the line-up made us look forward to a good spectacle, especially the quiet confidence we felt out of Spain’sPau Capell(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) when we spoke with him pre-race. After the fanfare and freneticism of the UTMB start, the countdown to the race finally ended and the men dashed off. In the lead off the line was Capell and Chinese starMin Qi. Pau Capell already alone and way out front at St. Gervais, 20 kilometers into the 2019 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks In a race filled with complex and intertwining variables, the men’s race for the win was perhaps as simple as it’s been at UTMB in a half decade or more. Capell immediately surged to the front and never looked back. We’ve seen this kind of running before, at this race and this early place in the event and, honestly, the odds are stacked heavily against the pace setter. What was funny–or at least coincidental–about all this is that Capell even said in his pre-race interview with iRunFar that he planned to take it slow while he thought others would go out too hard. At just 31km in, the Catalan had a full eight minutes on Thévenard in second, for example. But when we spoke with him post-race, he said that he ran according to the splits he’d made, and was surprised that his intentional pacing put him ahead of everyone. Chasers at this point, 31km, included the likes ofZach Miller(pre-race interview),Tim Tollefson(pre-race interview),Erik Sorenson,Hayden Hawks,Jing Liang, Qi,Guo-Min Deng, andCan-Hua Luo, what amounts to four Americans and four Chinese runners. At 31km, there were around 30 runners within 15 minutes of the lead. Now that part is something we can always count on, the huge depth of the field. After the first big ascent on the Col du Bonhomme around the race’s marathon mark, things remained about the same, with Capell pushing the pace and opening his gap even more. After a quick gear check, he took less than three minutes in the aid station at 50km, called Les Chapieux and way out in remote Italy, before pushing on solo.Robert Hajnal(pre-race interview), the Romanian underdog from last year who burst onto the world’s stage in taking second at this race, jumped into the top 10 together with AmericanAlex Nichols. Onward around the mountain we go. Robert Hajnal at Courmayeur, 80km into the race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The Italian side of UTMB usually witnesses a lot of drops, and this year wasn’t an exception. One of the top runners to stop then was Tollefson, who’d become physically ill. But the Italian side of the mountain and it being the rough halfway point of the race, also sees runners emerging from the early fray as strong contenders for the full distance. Among these potentials we had the United Kingdom’sAndy SymondsandTom Owens(post-race interview). So, too, we noticed New Zealand’sScott Hawker(post-race interview) was moving toward the top 10. And the USA’sAndrew Miller–remember him as the 2016 Western States 100 champ?–jumped into the discussion, too. Scott Hawker cresting Grand Col Ferret at sunrise. Photo: Trail Running Argentina/iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Fast forward a few more kilometers to the Grand Col Ferret at 101km into the race and the border between Italy and Switzerland. It’s probably downplaying his performance to say that Capell charged the big climb, and then he kept on charging to Champex-Lac at 126km. In both places we saw him panting with the effort and moving so fast, possessing not an inkling of hesitation. But so was Thévenard, who has historically put moves on his competition in this section of the course. Thévenard moved well, gaining plenty of time on the men behind him but still losing minutes to the lead. Entering into the race’s final third, it was looking like Capell was the better runner. Up on the col we met a Hajnal who wasn’t as fresh but was still moving in third. And in a move of complete badassery, Hawker seemed to have left his earlier rough patch behind, and was now fourth and looking great. Xavier Thévenard pushing it at La Fouly in Switzerland. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At Trient, 143km into UTMB, Thévenard had clearly pushed but couldn’t make headway on the big gap to the lead and was looking a bit worn. In fact, it seems like these efforts instead led to a rough patch he’d stay in until the race was almost over. Hawker jumped on the podium spot, but he also had Owens following close. New names in the top 10 in the race’s final third includedJoaquin Lopezfrom Ecuador and the Basque battlerJavier Dominguez. Hajnal finally withdrew from the race at this point, and the race also lost Nichols and both Millers in various places around the second half of the course. Qi finished, however far back in the field. Pau Capell at Champex-Lac. He was untouchable by everyone at the 2019 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Capell finally achieved his ultimate goal of the season, winning the 2019 UTMB. Thévenard was second, after chasing all day. He’d posted his desired splits on social media beforehand, which he said post-race were based on his 2015 race, and finished within four minutes of them! Hawker had his breakout race finishing in third. The work done by the British lads also got its good pay: Owens finished fourth and Symonds in fifth. Lopez andHo-Chung Wongfrom Hong Kong tied for sixth, Japan’sMasatoshi Obarafinished eighth, and France’sGermain Grangiertied for ninth with Dominguez. What a year at UTMB!

2019 Pikes Peak Marathon Results," ThePikes Peak Marathonis a one-of-kind race. Runners begin on the streets of Manitou Springs, Colorado, run a half marathon to the top of 14,115-foot Pikes Peak on the historic Barr Trail while climbing 7,770 feet, and descend all the way back to downtown Manitou again. Add in the factors of altitude, Colorado’s hot summer temperatures, an at-times-sandy trail, now 64 years of history, as well as deep competition and this adds up to a race story as unique as the event itself. Kilian Jornetreturned to this race for the second time, his first time since 2012, and ran unchallenged at the race’s helm, finishing in the sixth-fastest time in the race’s now-64-year history.Maude Mathys, too, proved untouchable in the women’s race, setting a big new women’s course record. Thanks toSalomonfor making our coverage of this year’s Pikes Peak Marathon possible! To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. There was a lot of speculation prior to the 2019 Pikes Peak Marathon, especially aroundMatt Carpenter’srecord of 3:16:22 which he set in 1993 and whether the Spaniard who lives in NorwayKilian Jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) could possibly break it. Many people thought he could and many thought he wouldn’t–the latter group including Jornet himself who said pre-race that Carpenter’s record was something “really special.” By just a couple miles into the race, Jornet had already broken free of the field and basically solo time trialled the rest of the event. He summited Pikes Peak in 2:09, some eight minutes off record pace but four minutes in front of anyone else, proving himself a level in front of the rest of the men’s field but not on the level of Carpenter circa 1993. Between the summit and the finish line, Jornet put another 7.5 minutes on everyone else, crossing the line in 3:27:28. No doubt, this is a fast time, the sixth-fastest in the race’s long and competitive history. Kilian Jornet near the summit of Pikes Peak on his way to winning the 2019 Pikes Peak Marathon. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks After a couple rough races, AmericanSage Canaday(post-race interview) has come on strong with his 11th place atSierre-Zinaltwo weekends ago and now a great performance here. Canaday ran among the men’s leaders until just after halfway up the half-marathon ascent. From there all the way up to the 14,000-plus-foot peak, he built a gap on the rest of the men’s field, arriving to the top in second place and 3.5 minutes in front of third. He said after the race that he knew he was a better ascender than descender, so he wanted to get a gap to the top that he could hold to the finish. This is exactly what he did, arriving to the finish line still solidly in second. His 3:39 finish improves upon his sixth-place debut here last year in 3:46. Sage Canaday running toward second place at the 2019 Pikes Peak Marathon. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Switzerland’sMarc Lauenstein(post-race interview), who was the 2014 Pikes Peak Marathon champion, arrived to the Pikes Peak summit in third place, looking calm and floating in the high-altitude thin air. He opened it up on the descent to clock the day’s second-fastest downhill. It quite the charge, not enough to catch second-place Canaday but plenty fast to hold off everyone else. 2014 Pikes Peak Marathon champion Marc Lauenstein takes third at the race’s 2019 edition. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell SpaniardAritz Egeaand AmericanDavid Sinclairseemed to battle for much of the race, the pair arriving to the summit within just a few seconds of each other, Sinclair a bit ahead. Their duel went all the way to the line with Egea and his Basque Country bloodline beating Sinclair by just about a half minute. It was Sinclair’s second year in a row of finishing in fifth. Full results. Ahead of the race, much more talk was about the men’s record than the women’s. Despite this, it was Switzerland’sMaude Mathyswho put on the master class of record breaking. After herSierre-Zinalshowdown, where she set a record two weeks ago, she had a bright day here on Pikes Peak too. She started in the front, pushed the pace, and gained all her time on the record on the uphill. At Barr Camp, 7.6 miles into the race, she was more than six minutes up on the record. Then, at the summit turnaround, she was 13-plus-minutes ahead of the record. Like Kilian Jornet in the men’s race, Mathys solo at the front of the women’s race went more like a time trial. From the summit to the finish, she ran very strong, but not fast enough to gain any more time on the record. Her 4:02:41 is a new course record that bestsMegan Kimmel’s2018 time of 4:15:04 by about 12.5 minutes. (In 2015, Mathys received a warning without suspension from the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases of Swiss Olympic for two positive tests for clomifene [previously clomiphene] after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.Mathys’s Quartz Program profile shows regular health monitoring and a July 2019 anti-doping control.Quartz Program info.) Maude Mathys setting a new Pikes Peak Marathon record at the race’s 2019 edition. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Yngvild Kaspersen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had her own fantastic race. By the time she passed Barr Camp at mile 7.6, she was a minute in front of the rest of the field. This lead would basically grow by a few seconds to a minute each time we saw her. Kaspersen, a Norwegian who lives at sea level, said after the race that she was nervous about the extremely high altitude of Pikes Peak. It turns out she had not much to worry about, as she looked like she was jogging easily at the summit turnaround. She also said that her two-week vacation in Colorado ahead of the race probably helped her to feel comfortable up there. Kaspersen had a great downhill run, posting the day’s fastest women’s downhill split and crossing the line with a gap to the rest of the field. Yngvild Kaspersen looking strong in second at the 2019 Pikes Peak Marathon. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Strong, steady, and even-keeled on both the uphill and downhill is how I would describe South Africa’sMeg Mackenzie’s(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) performance. And honestly, I found this effort to be quite impressive because it looked like she experienced all-day pressure fromAmandine Ferratoof France. A bit like the men’s race pair Aritz Egea and David Sinclair, Mackenzie and Ferrato were almost always passing us within a few seconds of each other. At the summit turnaround, it was actually Ferrato who arrived in third and Mackenzie fourth. By halfway down the descent, Mackenzie moved solidly into third and was two minutes ahead of fourth-place Ferrato, a gap she’d basically take to the finish. Meg Mackenzie summiting Pikes Peak en route to third place at the 2019 Pikes Peak Marathon. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Spain’sEliGordón(pre-race interview) had a move-up-from-the-back kind of race, starting out in the back half of the women’s top 10 and then moving into the top five by the race’s halfway point. Her work was not yet done, though, as she was challenged by the women behind her to maintain a fast descent pace. She looked truly relieved to cross the finish line in Manitou Springs as the fifth-place finisher. Full results.

2019 Western States 100 Results,"In a rare turn of summer events, a weather system from near Alaska bumped south into California, bringing with it unseasonably cool temperatures to the start of the 2019Western States 100. As such, the thermometers never even hit the mid-80s Fahrenheit at the race’s lowest altitudes, a good 15 to 20 degrees cooler than normal. With this, many runners were able to press the pace without the heat pressing back, leading to some fast times and, in some runners, aggressive running. In the women’s race,Clare Gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) emerged at the front of a fascinating and dynamic-to-the-wire women’s race to run the second-fastest time in women’s history, whileBrittany PetersonandKaci Lickteigrounded out the women’s podium. Jim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won the men’s race handily, resetting his own 2018 course record by over 20 minutes.Jared Hazencrossed the finish in a solid second place–also under the previous course record–whileTom Evansdebuted at the WS 100 in third. You can now watch thetop-three menandtop-three womenfinish and have their finish-line interviews. A special thanks toDrymaxfor once again making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible! Thanks also toHoka One OneandBUFF®for their support of our Western States coverage. Why is it that we run 100-mile races? They are long and they hurt–sometimes a lot. But there’s something about the mystique of the 100-mile distance that makes them so worthwhile. Over the course of such a long journey, really, anything can happen and nothing is guaranteed.All of that said, I honestly thought this was going to beCourtney Dauwalter’s(pre-race interview)year, again. In fact, as the weather forecast leveled into something resembling cool for race day, I was almost certain she’d set a course record. In fact, I was so convinced I’d written down a lot of fact pieces aboutEllie Greenwood’sspectacular course-record run in 2012 to share as part of Dauwalter’s day. For the race’s first 70 miles, the story played out very close to this. Courtney started rather calmly before spending the race’s middle miles chewing into the course record. And the last time I saw her with my own eyes at mile 61, she looked just fine. Courtney Dauwalter leading at mile 55 of the 2019 Western States 100… under record pace. All photos: iRunFar/Bryon Powell So it was with as much surprise as I’m sure we all felt that I heard from members of our coverage team at Peachstone, about mile 71 and along thehighly runnable California Street, that she was limping noticeably. Eight miles later at the Rucky Chucky river crossing, she was still leading, but it wasn’t looking good. She dropped at the Green Gate aid station two miles later with a hip injury. EnterClare Gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), now 2019 Western States 100 champ. There’s something so full circle about this story, because the only previous time that Gallagher was at the WS 100 was two years ago when she was running in podium position and had to drop at what I believe was after mile 90… with a leg injury. This year, it was she with the body that held itself together for the full distance. Clare Gallagher smiling in second place during the early miles. But we need to back up, all the way up to mile 15, because this was where we first saw Gallagher running in second place. This would be the position she would hold all the way up until taking over the race lead after the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78, some 63 miles later. What happened during all these miles? Well, at the finish, Gallagher said she thought she was racing for second place, that essentially there was a women’s race behind Dauwalter’s race. During all that time, she said she was carefully racing the people behind her, meting out the energy she needed to stay ahead of them. But when it was her turn to lead, Gallagher took over with ferocity. Gallagher’s ferocity was only matched by the fierceness ofBrittany Peterson(post-race interview) who, like Gallagher, ran so steadily in third position for much of the race. Peterson settled into third place before mile 15, and ran there until the climb from Rucky Chucky after mile 78 where she moved into second place ahead of an ailing Dauwalter. Brittany Peterson took second at the 2019 Western States 100. And then, really, the race was just beginning. At mile 85, Peterson was in second and nine minutes behind leader Gallagher. Just nine miles later after mile 94, the two were neck and neck through the Pointed Rocks aid station. The race was on and it was clear that this was not going t0 be a hand-holding tie. According to Peterson after the finish, Gallagher surged incredibly after mile 94, and she was unable to respond. Indeed, the numbers match. Between miles 94.3 and 96.8–that’s 2.5 miles–Gallagher gained one minute and 45 seconds. And the difference would grow from there. In the end, Gallagher crossed the finish line in 17:23, what amounts to the second-fastest finish ever in race hisrory. Peterson crossed the line in second place in 17:34, what should be the fourth-fastest time ever. Somehow, it also seemed clear ahead of time thatKaci Lickteig(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) should have a very good race. She’s the 2016 champ who’s suffered some ups and downs through the last few years of injury. But this year she’d been injury-free and so consistent in her training and racing that it seemed inevitable that she’d have quite a race. Lickteig ran the first half of the race in the second half of the top 10 before moving up in the race’s second half into her ultimate finish position. When she crossed the line in third place, her 17:55 was a personal PR on the course in her six runnings of the race and faster than when she won in 2015. It’s good to have Lickteig–happy AND competitive–back at the WS 100. Kaci Lickteig after finishing in third. It’s always interesting to watch when a finish line, which is almost exclusively a shared finish line between two separate men’s and women’s races, becomes a women’s finish for a while. Inevitably, men get their solo finish line for the time before women begin arriving, so it’s fun when just women roll over for a spell. And that’s what happened with fourth, fifth, and sixth-place finishersBeth Pascall,Camelia Mayfield, andKaytlyn Gerbin(pre-race interview). Over the span of some 20 minutes, no man crossed the line–just women. And these three women put on quite a show. Pascall practiced patience, moving up and seemingly looking stronger and more comfortable as the race went on. It was one of those circumstances that had me thinking she only needed more real estate and she could have found the podium. Ultimately, she took fourth. Beth Pascall looking pleased with fourth place. Mayfield and Gerbin had an incredible race-closing sprint, with Mayfield overtaking and outsprinting Gerbin only on the Placer High School track in the last meters of the race. They are registered on the results to have finished two seconds apart, but in person, it was a lot closer than that. After each of them running with strength all day, Mayfield and Gerbin respectively finished fifth and sixth. Camelia Mayfield outsprinting Kaytlyn Gerbin to the line. Nicole Bitter(post-race interview) took seventh, in doing so setting a huge new WS 100 PR of 18:55, which is more than 80 minutes faster than her previous time, which she set back in 2015 in taking sixth. Kathryn Drewwas eighth, and she executed what looked like from the outside as an almost-perfect race. She ran chill and yet focused early before putting the hammer down and holding stake in the women’s top 10 later. Addie Bracywas ninth in her first WS 100, and I can’t help but think it was a look of relief on her face when she finished.Corrine Malcolmfollowed up on her ninth place last year with a 10th place this time around, running outside the women’s top 10 until the race’s last 10 miles or less. Lucy Bartholomew, last year’s third-place finisher, crossed the line in 15th place. 2018 UTMB championFrancesca Canepawas 17th. Notable DNFs in the women’s race includedCamille Herronat mile 55,Amanda Bashamat mile 61, andYiOu Wangat mile 67. We haven’t heard details from all of them yet, but did hear Basham hurt her leg in a fall. Full results. Jim Walmsley’s Course Record Two years, two course records.Jim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) reset his own course record at the 2019 Western States 100 through a combination of early race patience, middle-race pressing, and late-race raging. Let’s dig in. In the first miles of this year’s race, Walmsley didn’t lead, including when we saw him pass over over the race’s high point, at the iconic Escarpment, at mile 3.5. And, by the race’s live tracker, even as late at mile 10 he was still well out of the lead. However, that changed some five miles later when we saw him at mile 15 and he was at the front of the race and about 1.5 minutes in front of everyone else. That said, he looked there like he wasn’t feeling the need to get anywhere too quickly just yet. He was clearly choosing patience in the race’s early miles, and, honestly, this was a kind of Walmsley I’d only seen glimpses of before. It would go like this until approximately mile 30, at Robinson Flat, where is seemed he’d put his foot on the gas and went through a hair under his own record split for the first time. But easy does it, as from there he’d clip a few seconds or a minute at each aid station off his own record pace such that over 40 miles later at the Peachstone aid station on the Cal Street section of the course, he was 16 minutes ahead of his own course record. These forty-six miles of running, he pressed some. Jim Walmsley on his way to resetting his own course record at the 2019 Western States 100. But then, from miles 70 to mile 94, Walmsley raged, gaining seven minutes on his course record–running a good bit per mile faster than he did last year when he set a then course record–and rolling through the Pointed Rocks aid station at mile 94 over 23 minutes ahead of his record. We all began to think,How low was he going to go?In his interview with us pre-race, he wondered the same. Could he run 10 minutes faster than last year? Twenty minutes? Perhaps even sub-14 hours? The answer, at least this year, is 14:09:28, improving upon his 2018 finish time of 14:30:04 by over 20 minutes. Walmsley is a pretty intense guy when he races, and he rarely shows much more than a little bit of emotion. It was a true pleasure to watch him cross the line fist pumping, hooting, and hollering. He was legitimately happy and letting it all out, a deserved celebration. The Rest of the Men’s Race Jared Hazen’s(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) nickname amongst friends is the ‘Tank,’ and he was a force rolling down the trail all day. He may be small in frame but his running style today was anything but. He was, for sure, a tank. Like his friend, roommate, and training companion, Jim Walmsley, Hazen was relaxed at the race opening–and even as far as 15 miles in he was in the back half of the men’s top 10. But when Walmsley went to the front of the race, Hazen went chasing, settling into second place, a position he’d hold all day and all race. Between miles 10 and 40, the gap between Walmsley and Hazen slowly widened from a minute to about 10, and from there that was the approximate gap that would remain between the pair until mile 85. Let me say that again, for 45 miles and with each of them running independently, they maintained just about the same pace, 10 minutes apart from each other. At the finish line post-race, Hazen would say he paid a little bit late in the race for the pushing he did earlier on to try and stay in contact with Walmsley. This pans out in the numbers, too, because Hazen ultimately finished second and 17-plus minutes off the lead. All that said, his 14:26:46 finish was better than Walmsley’s previous course record and is now the second-fastest men’s time stamp on this race. What a day. Jared Hazen was a tank at mile 78. How about those 100-mile debuters,Tom Evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andMatt Daniels(pre-race interview)? The duo would go third-fourth on the day, each via their own racing style. While both of them said pre-race that they’d aim for a bit of patience early on in the race, on paper it looks as if Daniels held his word a bit better. He was not even in the top 10 at 10 miles into the race! However, by about one third of the way into the race he’d wriggled his way up into third position, which he’d hold through the race’s second third. Then, there was the journey of Evans, which began a bit more aggressively with him in third just 10 miles into the race, a mid-race lull which would see him lapse back to fifth place in the heart of the canyons part of the course, before he and Daniels flip-flopped positions on Cal Street.At the end, it wasn’t close, with Evans crossing the line as the third and final sub-15-hour finisher of the night and joining the ranks of a select few who’ve finished under that barrier. Daniels arrived 22 minutes later, both showing a special kind of 100-mile racing ability–and future potential. I know it’s still the 2019 race day, but the idea of these top-four men on the starting line next year, all with this year’s accumulated experience, is a grand one. Tom Evans would take third. Mark Hammond(pre-race interview) said in his pre-race interview that he planned to go out a little more aggressively this year, and that he’d been doing interval training to hopefully develop more leg speed. Though he finished fifth after two years finishing in third place, his 15:36 this year is more than a half hour faster than he’d yet run here. His new approach appeared to pay out dividends. This year, Mark Hammond took fifth, and set a WS 100 PR. Back in 2015,Gediminas Griniusfinished fourth in 15:40. This year, he crossed the line in sixth and 15:43. How about that for consistency? This finish is his first in the U.S.’s Grand Slam of Ultraunning. Next up, theVermont 100 Milein three weeks. Not bad for the first of four Grand Slam of Ultrarunning races for Gediminas Grinius. What an impressive run we all witnessed out ofStephen Kersh! He took seventh and ran 15:54 in not only his first Western States, but also his first 100 miler. And that’s on the shoulders of him running his first 50 miler just a couple months ago at theLake Sonoma 50 Mile. We should all expect to see more good things come out of him here in trail ultrarunning. Patrick Reaganhad a helluva’ race! He was not even in the top 10 until No Hands Bridge, almost 97 miles into the race. If we look back to our notes from early in the race, he was running right around 20th place as late as 30 miles in. In the last 3.5 miles, Reagan pushed it even further to finish eighth. Jeff Browning’sprevious WS 100 PR was 16:30, and this year he reduced that to sub-16 hours and 15:54. He crossed the line in ninth place, andKyle Pietariwas hot on his heels in 10th, finishing just a couple seconds later. Ryan Sandes, the 2017 WS 100 champ, crossed the line in 11th place. Notably,Ian Sharman(post-race interview) did get his 10th finish, but this was the first one outside of the top 10. He crossed the line in 16:54, which is right in there among his finishing times over the years, in 15th place. It’s just that this year took a faster run to get inside the top 10. And, if you add up all 10 finishes, those 1,000 miles took less than a week in total. Also, 51-year-oldSteven Mooreran 18:14:57 to best the men’s 50-to-59 age-group record of 18:43, set byDoug Latimerback in 1988. WhileScotty Mills(post-race interview) earned his 20th Western States finish. A few DNFs to note:Jordi Gamitostopped at mile 78,Morgan Elliottat mile 80, andEric Sensemanat mile 85. Again, we don’t have details, but spoke with Gamito at mile 61 who was both limping and complaining of stomach issues then. Fifty-one-year-old Steven Moore setting the men’s 50-to-59 age-group record. Full results.

2019 Trail World Championships Results,"The 2019Trail World Championshipstook place in Miranda do Corvo, Portugal on a 44.2-kilometer (27.5 miles) course with 2,200 meters (7,218 feet) of climbing. What looked benign on paper proved to be fairly difficult in real life as bouts of technical terrain as well as steep climbs and descents frequently peppered what was otherwise runnable terrain. The weather also offered challenge, with a cool but very humid morning yielding to a warm and still-humid summer day. In the men’s race, the United Kingdom’sJonathan Albon(post-race interview) took home the individual gold medal while Team France captured the team win. In the women’s race, France’sBlandine L’hirondel(post-race interview) had a big breakout win to earn individual gold and lead Team France’s women to a team win, too.

You, the iRunFar reader, can join them in supporting our race coverage bybecoming a monthly patron on Patreonormaking a one-time donation. Switzerland’sChristian Mathys(post-race interview) took the men’s race out, stepping into the lead from pretty much ‘go.’ He said after the race that he wanted to be in the front before the route closed into singletrack trail. Mathys said he felt strong every time there was a downhill, but that the chasing men would come back to him on the climbs. The men’s race thus progressed in an accordion style until after midway. In fact, when we saw the lead men at almost exactly the halfway point, Mathys held a minute-and-a-half minute lead. However, some 10k later, the tables had turned at it was the U.K.’sJonathan Albon(post-race interview) who had now gained a minute-and-a-half lead over the rest of the men’s field. He would say after the race that he tried to moderate his pace early before pushing in the middle and later parts of the race. When we saw Albon at 39k into the 44k race, he was two minutes in front of the rest of the field, his lead at the finish, too. Last year, Albon debuted at the Trail World Championships in a strong fourth place. This year, he nailed it to become the 2019 Trail World Champion.

In fact, he finished on the podium at the race in 2013, taking third when it was a 75k distance. Rancon says he prefers and is a specialist in shorter-distance trail running, though, so he tried to qualify for Team France this year because the Trail World Championships were shorter. Rancon ran in the men’s top five during the race’s first half before surging into second place before 31k. He held this position strongly from there to the finish. Julien Rancon of France taking second. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks While Mathys said he suffered the edge of cramping late in the race, he was able to manage the feeling and prevent full-on cramps. He was put to a big test with 2k to go, though, as Italy’sFrancesco Puppi(pre-race interview) passed him and took over third place for a short stretch. Mathys explained after the race that he caught up with and re-passed Puppi with just 800 meters left, finishing in third by just 10 seconds. What a race for the final podium position! Italy’s Puppi began the race a bit further back, but made up positions as the race went on. After finishing fourth in his Trail World Championships debut, Puppi said he gave it everything he had on the day. Christan Mathys of Switzeland upon finishing third.

Only a minute later, Martin’s teammateEmmanuel Meyssatcrossed the line, sealing the deal on a Team France gold medal with their second, fourth, and fifth-place individual finishes. France’sLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) was seventh, Spain’sAntonio Martinezeighth, Spain’sAndreu Simonninth, and Portugal’sHélio Fumotenth. If it sounds like Spain was on its way to a team second place, hold up just a moment. The United Kingdom’sCarl BellandAndrew Daviescrossed the line in 13th and 16th respectively, securing a team silver. Then, it was Spain who took a team third.

Full results. As with every edition of the Trail World Championships, the women’s field is one of the most competitive in our sport. Especially in a shorter distance like it was today, where runners from both trail running and shorter-distance mountain running gathered together to meet on this event’s middle ground. Nevertheless, this looks like it didn’t make a huge difference onBlandine L’hirondel’s(post-race interview) race strategy. The Frenchwoman went out hard, opened a gap, kept on running hard, and won straight out. At the finish, she was eight minutes ahead of any other runner, which might as well be a lifetime in a 44k race. Wherever we saw her, she was solid. She probably had a small low patch about three quarters of the way through the race, but the rolling downhill finish helped her stay strong and take the win completely unchallenged. To be honest, she looked shocked to arrive at the finish as the women’s winner. If anyone’s race should be called a breakout, it’s L’hirondel’s. Blandine L’hirondel of France after winning the 2019 Trail World Championships. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The rest of the podium spots were tough to grab. Several women said after the race that L’hirondel took the race out really fast, and they felt compelled to play chase in an effort to not let her get too far away. A group of women started fast as they chased, including names likeAdeline Rocheof France,Denisa Dragomir(pre-race interview) of Romania, as well asSheila Avilés(post-race interview) andAzara Garcíaof Spain. Eventually, the pack would thin down to Avilés and García running in second and third, and close together at times. Avilés explained after the race that, though she and García were at times running very close to each other, it wasn’t intentional and each was running her own race. Italy’sSilvia Rampazzoand New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) featured for most of the day in the women’s top ten, though Croft started the race a little more casually than Rampazzo.  Italy’s Rampazzo was sixth,Gemma Arenasfrom Spain was seventh, andSarah Vieuillefrom France was eighth.Aydee Loayzafrom Peru, a woman we haven’t seen race before, took ninth via an aggressive and impressive effort as she broke into the women’s top ten. France’s Roche managed to survive her hard start to finish tenth. Spain’s Sheila Avilés after placing third.

2019 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results,"Amongst a challenging course and competitive fields,Ragna Debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), of the Netherlands but living in Spain, and France’sThibaut Garrivier(post-race interview) won the 2019Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Before dawn on Saturday morning, May 11, from El Faro de Fuencaliente, the south tip of La Palma island, Transvulcania fired off and runners raced for the sky. By the time the 74.3-kilometer (46 miles) course concluded in the city of Los Llanos on the island’s west side, participants racked up some 4,350 meters (14,280 feet) of climbing. During that distance, they ran through volcanic cinder, over lava rocks, among the island’s famous banana plantations, over the island’s approximately 2,420-meter (7,940 feet) high point, and on the race course’s infamous descent from that high point to sea level. Both the men’s and women’s races were dynamic courtesy of deep fields, with the men’s race staying volatile until the bottom of that 2,400-meter descent when there was less than 10k left to race. It was there that Thibaut Garrivier finished the downhill faster than the rest of the field and created the few-minute gap which secured him the win. The women’s race stayed similarly tight up and over the race’s high point, though women’s champion Ragna Debats used the long downhill to create a major gap of 15 minutes by 5k to go. iRunFar is an independent entity covering the sports of trail running and ultrarunning around the world.

To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Let’s jump right into it. Sweden’sPetter Engdahl(post-race interview), a Nordic ski racer turned mountain runner, took the race out hot. At 7k into the day, he’d already created a little space between he and the rest of the field, though many men played close chase. This time gap increased to about six minutes around the 40k point. About then, though, two men behind Engdahl began working together to reel him back in. Petter Engdahl leading the race at 22k before continuing on to take third. All photos: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Enter France’sThibaut Garrivier(post-race interview) and Russia’sDmitry Mityaev(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Though earlier in the race, the pair ran among some pace pushers who would eventually drop back and out–such as Italy’sMarco De Gasperiand France’sSylvain Court–by the halfway point they’d moved into second and third positions. Roughly there, they started working together to reconnect with Engdahl over the race’s highest terrain. As such, the trio arrived to the Roque de los Muchachos aid station at 51k on the island’s high point within a few seconds of the other, Engdahl and Garrivier actually together and Mityaev a few seconds back. Thibaut Garrivier on his way to winning the 2019 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. But as is usually the case with this race’s unique 2,400-meter continuous descent, the race really shook out there. Engdahl dropped off the lead group, later saying he experienced some problems on the downhill. He fell hard at one point and it shook his confidence enough that he rolled a bit more conservatively after that. Then, it was a two-man race between Garrivier and Mityaev. Both reported after the race taking hard falls on the descent, too, though Mityaev’s fall caused enough pain that he had to pause for some 40 seconds and he lost contact with Garrivier. Garrivier, on the other hand, continued his strong descent, finishing it with a 3.5-minute lead. The race doesn’t end when that descent does, though! It’s still about 5k to the finish line, which includes 400 meters of climbing. However, Garrivier held that 3.5-minute gap all the way to the finish line. After taking third last year, Garrivier movef up the the premier position to become the 2019 Transvulcania Ultramarathon champion. While Garrivier has had increasingly strong results in the last few years, this win marks a definitive breakout. Mityaev crossed the line a few minutes later to take second for the second year in a row. Though Engdahl couldn’t compete for the win, it was no contest between he and the rest of the men’s field for his third-place position, with the next man not rolling over the line for some 15 minutes. Dmitry Mityaev after finishing second for the second year in a row. Jonathan Albon(pre-race interview), who lives in Norway and is from the U.K., said after the finish that he suffered the heat but otherwise felt okay in taking fourth. Switzerland’sDiego Pazosfinished fifth, completing his double of taking second at the Madeira Island Ultra-Trail just two weekends ago. Peru’sRemigio Huamanhung in the men’s top 10 all day to ultimately finish sixth. In seventh was the USA’sMax King, who said ahead of the race that he was battling plantar fasciitis. He looked strong and moved well in the race’s uphill and flatter terrain, but ultimately wasn’t able to run the huge, late-race downhill properly due to his foot. Spain’sManuel Anguitafinished eighth, following up on his sixth place here last year. The ninth and 10th positions were filled by Germans via the efforts ofFlorian ReichertandHannes Namberger. Japan’sRuy Ueda(pre-race interview) was another DNF. He unfortunately got sick a couple days before the race and said by 22k that he was already feeling like he had no energy. Full results. The top-10 men of the 2019 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. France’sAnne-Lise Rousset Séguret(pre-race interview) set the pace off the starting line. In our pre-race interview, Rousset Séguret said she was confident in her training and preparation, and it showed. There may also have been something to the fact that she had two previous second-place Transvulcania finishes going into this year’s edition. Just like Petter Engdahl in the men’s race, Rousset Séguret had a gap at 7k into the race. But unlike the men’s race, a couple women would not let Rousset Séguret get away from the field on her own. Anne-Lise Rousset Séguret leading the women at 22k. She eventually finished second for the third time at Transvulcania. So here we addRagna Debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andMegan Kimmel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) to this story. As the massive, initial climb continued toward the 16k mountain top that’s a focal point of the race’s first half, this trio of ladies were grouped within about a minute of each other. And as a group they were breaking away from the rest of the women’s field. By 16k, third place was more than 10 minutes ahead of fourth and this lead grew to about 18 minutes by 42k. Theirs was such a strong break that, barring anything crazy happening, these women would become the podium. However this is ultrarunning and crazy things happen all the time, which is half of the fun of it. Eventually, on the gradual uphill terrain between 31k and 42k, Debats made her way into the leadership position. She would say after the race that she felt okay at the start but suffered a physical low around 20k where she tempered her effort. Then, she said she felt better again. By 51k in and over the race’s high point at Roque de los Muchachos, Debats had a five-minute lead. Kimmel rolled over the high point in second, and Rousset Séguret had fallen back to third, another four minutes back of Kimmel. Though she no longer led, Rousset Séguret’s position still seemed safe, as it was more than 20 minutes until the next woman hit the high point after her. Debats exhibited incredible strength on the 18k-long downhill between 51k and 69k, and tripled the length of her lead in that time. Then, in the tough 5k finish, which involves running up a dry riverbed, making a steep 400-meter climb, and finishing with a couple flat kilometers in Los Llanos, she picked up a few more minutes on all the other women, crossing the line as the 2019 Transvulcania Ultramarathon champion. Ragna Debats on her way to winning the 2019 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Kimmel held onto second place for over half of the descent, but was overtaken by a surging Rousset Séguret in the bottom half. Rousset Séguret arrived to the finish line in second place–for the third time at this race. And Kimmel crossed in third, rounding out the women’s podium. Ultimately, the three-woman early race break stuck. Megan Kimmel finishing third. Until 51k, Russia’sEkaterina Mityaevaran in the back half of the women’s top 10, in eighth place for much of the morning. But Mityaeva runs downhills well and she moved up from eighth to fourth on the 2,400-meter, 18k descent, a position she then maintained to the finish. Austria’sKristin Berglundhad a steady day, finishing fifth after running most of the race in the middle positions of the women’s top 10. Italy’sElisa Descotook sixth place. From 2010 to 2012, Desco served a two-year ban from the IAAF after she tested positive for EPO at the 2009 World Mountain Running Championships. Zimbabwe’sEmily Hawgoodtook seventh;Camille Bruyas, a French citizen from La Réunion, was eighth; Germany’sEva Spergerwas ninth; and Spain’sMaria Zorrozatook 10th. Full results.

2019 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results," The 2019Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) began in the coastal village of Porto Moniz, on the island’s northwest coast, traced through the island’s interior mountain ranges, traversed deep and dissected valleys, and finished in the port city of Machico, on the island’s southeast coast. The route added up to 115 kilometers (71.5 miles) and 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of climbing. The course itself is diverse, with a mix of steep and technical terrain as well as flat and fast roads and the island’s famous levada trails, or the pathways next to irrigation ditches. This year’s edition, the 11th, saw relatively fair weather. With a midnight start and seven hours of night running to begin, runners experienced cool temperatures through the night with wind in some locations and fog in others. After sunrise as the leaders headed toward the island’s highest and most exposed terrain, a strong wind but totally clear skies greeted them there. In the later morning and early afternoon, as the leaders traveled the race’s final 20 kilometers at low altitude, temperatures remained mild thanks to decent cloud cover, though the relative humidity was quite high. Their races played out quite differently, but both the USA’sCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and France’sFrançois D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ran away from their respective fields to take home dominant victories. For Courtney, she took the lead on the race’s first major climb after 5k, setting the women’s race tone and pace, and never looked back. François shared the race with other runners until just before 80k before closing the race’s final 35k at a pace no one else could match. This was the seventh race, a series race, in the 2019 Ultra-Trail World Tour. iRunFar is an independent entity covering the sports of trail running and ultrarunning around the world.

The high country of Madeira Island over which the Madeira Island Ultra-Trail travels. All photos: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Ahead of the race, many wondered how exactly the USA’sCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) might fare on the stairs and gnarly descents of Madeira Island. I think we all have our answer now: Dauwalter is a master of all terrain. But let’s back up to the beginning. After chasing defending championMimmi Kotka(pre-race interview) through the first couple kilometers, Dauwalter settled into the lead on the race’s first big ascent to Fanal, the first checkpoint at 14k. There, she posted a gap of just under two minutes to the rest of the women. While behind her there were several early shake-ups on who was in the immediate chasing position and while some women posted faster times than her on the earlier, big descents, no woman could match her overall pace. That is, on every climbing or flatter section, Dauwalter’s gap on the women’s field grew. And after the first couple large descents, she was making time on almost all of the rest of the field on the really technical sections and downhills, too. Courtney Dauwalter about to summit Pico do Areeiro at 76k into the 2019 Madeira Island-Ultra Trail. There was one woman who exceeded Dauwalter’s pace through the race’s most technical 5.5k after the island’s high point at Pico Ruivo and on some of the descents later in the race, and that’s Dauwalter’s country mateKatie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). From 61k through 99k, Schide was overall gaining on Dauwalter, picking up a couple minutes on her at the majority of checkpoints. At 99k, Schide’s deficit to Dauwalter had decreased to about 14 minutes, and with 16k yet to race, we all wondered if a race was about to, indeed, happen. But there was so much runnable terrain after 99k, and let’s just say that Dauwalter can really run. Her pace on the flattest, last kilometers was so strong that she was, in fact, faster than the men’s champion there. In the 11.8k between the final aid station of Larano and the finish, Dauwalter ran a 1:05:14 split. Men’s champion François D’haene ran 1:05:39. On a quick check of the men’s top 10, only one man posted a faster split in that section than she. Dauwalter crossed the MIUT finish line in Machico looking relieved, happy, and somehow still fresh as the women’s champion. Not only was Schide super strong all race, especially in the mountainous and technical sections, but she also had a super-positive demeanor out there, too. Schide seemed to move with a kind of levity that made moving fast look easy. She took second place, doing so with a large gap over the rest of the women’s field. Katie Schide taking the big mountains in stride on her way to second place. Third place Audrey Tanguy is in the background. Schide and France’sAudrey Tanguy(post-race interview) are friends, the pair going one-two at the 85k race of MIUT last year and racing as a team in a recent partner race in Europe. Schide and Tanguy fell into step with each other before the Chão da Ribeira aid station at 22k, and though they continued to leapfrog a bit, they were clearly working together for a lot of the middle of the race. This pair-up lasted basically through Chão da Lagoa at 81k, after which Schide surged. Though Tanguy lost contact with Schide, her late-race effort remained strong–and stronger than anyone else behind her. By the time she crossed the finish in third place, there was no other woman in sight for a half hour. Audrey Tanguy after taking third at the 2019 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail. I’m not going to lie, Spain’sMaite Maioralooked a little rough at the finish, with giant bruises and some trail rash on her left leg and her arms and legs coated in dirt–she must have gone full body to the ground at some point–but her condition there was just temporary and doesn’t match the strength she showed on course. A lot like men’s fifth-place finisher Lambert Santelli, who’s race is described below, Maiora raced with incredible consistency all day in fourth and fifth positions, before eventually moving for good into fourth where she would finish. Like Schide, she, too, was super positive on course. In fact, when we saw her approaching 1,800-meter Pico Areeiro, high wind was pushing her sideways on the exposed trail and it whipped her visor off her head and off the cliff. No matter, Maiora was still content. France’sJocelyne Paulysaid after the race that it was a struggle for her. Early race, she took a hard fall onto some rocks, one of which went right into her rib cage and caused pain and difficulty breathing for the rest of the race. As such, she looked really relieved to cross the finish in fifth place. Defending champion Kotka looks to have had a pretty tough day. Early in the race, she was strong on the downhills, but would lose time to the top women on the uphills. Later in the race she slowed and finished in 13th place. Full results. The 2019 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. Katie Schide, 1. Courtney Dauwalter, and 3. Audrey Tanguy. The way I see it, the race for the men’s podium can be divided into three parts: 1. The early race where many men ran close to the lead; 2. The breakaway of the trio composed of France’sFrançois D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Tim Tollefson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of the USA, and France’sGermain Grangierfrom the rest of the field; and 3. François’s solo, late-race dominance. We begin with part one, or the first 30k, where a long string of men ran within a couple minutes of the lead.At the first checkpoint of Fanal, 14k into the race, it was essentially a 20-man group within about two minutes of the lead. And by 22k at Chão da Ribeira, 15 men were still right there. The pacesetters of this group varied from moment to moment, but included defending championAndris Ronimoiss(pre-race interview) of Latvia, Sweden’s Petter Restorp, and France’s Thomas Angeli. Of course, the eventual podium finishers were there too, lingering. Somewhere before Estanquinhos at 32.5k, D’haene, Tollefson, and Grangier started running together and breaking free of the rest of the men’s field, which leads us to part two of the men’s race. At 32.5k, they were 2.5 minutes ahead of everyone else, at 41k it was five minutes, and by 61k at Curral das Freiras, the trio was a full eight minutes off the front. But almost all good bands eventually break up, and this group met that same fate at 61k. Part three of the men’s front race began when Tollefson took several extra minutes at the 61k aid station, and left about three minutes behind D’haene and Grangier. And on the massive climb to Madeira Island’s high point of Pico Ruivo between 61k and 71.5k, Tollefson lost more time, arriving to the summit 14 minutes behind the lead and in fourth place. D’haene and Grangier stayed together through 81k at Chão da Lagoa, after which D’haene took over solo leadership duties. From there to the finish, D’haene’s lead on the field grew, such that he crossed the finish with no one in sight for almost 25 minutes. His victory makes it his second MIUT win, and shows he’s beginning his 2019 season in fine form. François D’haene, 2019 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail champion. Switzerland’sDiego Pazos(post-race interview) is a great example of how you can run your own race and podium in a long ultramarathon. After running the first 15k close to the lead, Pazos spent the next marathon distance chilling, running around seven to eight minutes off the lead. Then, on the big climb out of Curral das Freiras to the island high point between 61k and 71.5k, his strong ascending moved him into podium position. For the next 15-plus-k and through the race’s most difficult terrain, Pazos recorded almost the same splits as eventual winner D’haene, which allowed him to move up into second place after the 80k point, a position he held to the finish. Diego Pazos celebrating second place. When we saw Tollefson at about 76k and in fourth, he said that his climbing legs were cooked but that he could still run the downhills and flats alright. It was clear that he was planning to keep his foot on the gas as best as he could. Relentless forward progress, as they say, and he moved up into third position before Portela at 99k and held it until the finish. Tim Tollefson taking in the night running which opened the race. Ahead of the race, Romania’sRobert Hajnalspent about 1.5 months living and running on Madeira Island to specifically prepare for MIUT. His preparations certainly paid off. After chilling outside of the men’s top 10 for the first half of the race, he stayed strong in the race’s second half, consistently moving up positions from checkpoint to checkpoint, and generally looking like he was having a good time doing so. Finally, at Portela at 99k, Hajnal arrived in fourth position, which he would hold until the finish. France’sLambert Santellihad an incredibly consistent race. For pretty much all 115k, he ran in fifth or sixth position. Each time we saw him, he seemed in total control. He ultimately found his final fifth-place position at 99k, and maintained it to the finish. Defending champion and early race pacesetter Ronimoiss dropped at 32.5k. And Grangier, who ran at the lead of the race, ran into problems starting around the Poiso checkpoint at 90.5k. Around then he fell and became injured, and after that traveled slowly to Portela at 99k where he dropped out. Full results. The 2019 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail men’s podium (l-to-r): 2.

2019 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results,"There was a little bit of mud and a little bit of heat, but it was a nearly perfect day for racing in the verdant California hills that make up theLake Sonoma 50 Milecourse. The front of both the women’s and the men’s fields saw dynamic changes through the race with the outcomes uncertain until the end whenJared Hazen(pre-andpost-race interviews) andAnna Mae Flynn(post-race interview) each crossed the finish first to take home the wins. Thanks toSalomonfor supporting our coverage of this year’s Lake Sonoma 50 Mile. You, the iRunFar reader, can join them in supporting our race coverage bybecoming a monthly patron on Patreonormaking a one-time donation. The women’s race didn’t go out quite as one might expect. Yes,Camille Herron(pre-race interview) ran at the front in the early miles, but she had a handful of women right behind her. Those women includedAmber Zimmerman,Anna Mae Flynn(post-race interview), andAddie Bracy(post-race interview) withYiOu Wang(pre-andpost-race interviews) andKelly Wolf(pre-race interview) still only a minute and change off the front at mile 11. Camille Herron and Amber Zimmerman leading the women at Warm Springs (mile 11.5). Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell However, the race saw major shake-ups even before mile 20. At mile 19.5 above Madrone Point, Amber was running in fourth and Camille in fifth both three to four minutes off the lead. Amber would get to the top of the climb there and stop due to a pre-existing injury. Camille would go on to the turnaround at mile 25 where she called it a day due to wonky hamstrings. Ah, but Anna Mae, Addie, and YiOu were all within a minute at mile 20. Anna Mae Flynn, Addie Bracy, and YiOu Wang leading the women’s race above Madrone around mile 20. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Fast forward 10 miles and YiOu had just under a minute lead on Addie and two-and-a-half minutes on Anne Mae. With Kelly Wolf running in fourth six minutes back and, then,Taylor NowlinandAnne-Marie Maddenmore than 12 minutes off, it seemed nearly certain that one of the three frontrunners would win. Coming through Warm Springs at mile 38, it looked like a two-woman race with YiOu still leading an unshakeable Addie Bracy with Anna Mae three minutes back. At the Island View aid station more than 45 miles into the race, YiOu finally seemed to have some breathing space with Addie falling off a bit to run with Anna Mae two minutes off the front. YiOu Wang leading at mile 30. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell But the race isn’t over until it’s over. YiOu kept moving right along, but Anna Mae was charging. Then, within sight of the finish Anna Mae surged through a muddy patch to overtake YiOu and earn the win. What a race! YiOu came in a few seconds later to finish second while Addie hung onto third. Kelly Wolf ran in no-woman’s land throughout the race, always in more or less the same fourth position, once you account for Camille’s and Amber’s drops. On the other hand, former Lake Sonoma champCassie Scallonnever had her top gear, but used her strength and consistency to move from near tenth in the early going to fifth by the end. In the back half of the top ten,Magdalena Bouletenjoyed herself on her way to finishing sixth. Taylor Nowlin ran consistently but never looked at ease en route to seventh. Anne-Marie Madden worked her way up through the field before fading a bit in the race’s latter half to finish eighth. On the other hand,Kristyn Kadaladidn’t move into the top ten until the race’s final third, but she finished ninth. Last year’s third-place finisherCamelia Mayfieldlooked like she was struggling most of the race, but held it together long enough to round out the top ten. Magdalena Boulet enjoying herself while running the 2019 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. The very front of 2019 Lake Sonoma men’s race was a three-man show put on byJared Hazen(pre-andpost-race interviews),Sébastien Spehler(pre-andpost-race interviews), andTom Evans(pre-andpost-race interviews). Indeed, from the sidelines it appeared that Jared or Seb set the race’s pace from the gun with the two challenging one other frequently throughout the race. Shortly after mid-race, Seb finally built a small lead, but it wouldn’t hold. Jared would move in front before the second pass through Warm Springs at mile 38 and build his small lead into a bigger one to win in one of the faster times in the race’s history. Seb Spehler, Jared Hazen, and Tom Evans leading the field at Warm Springs (mile 11.5). Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Now, Seb never faltered, but Tom Evans never relented in his pursuit of the leaders, who he essentially ran with through the race’s first half.Stephen Kershmade things a bit more interesting for Tom when he caught the Brit and the two ran together for a short while. However, Tom kept pushing and certainly would have seen Seb ahead of him through some of the races’s final miles. In the end, it would be the Frenchman Spehler taking second just 40 seconds ahead of Evans in third. While he finished fourth, Kersh looks to have earned a Western States 100 Golden Ticket entry as Spehler will decline his spot and Evans already has a spot in the race. It’s also worth noting that this was Kersh’s 50-mile debut. Jared Hazen smiles after winning the 2019 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Behind those front four, I believeGus Gibbs,Bobby Peavey, andDakota Jonesspent much of the race in their respective finishing positions of fifth, sixth, and seventh, although Gibbs was considerably closer to the frontrunners than the other two and Jones moved up after a slower start.Charlie WareandVince Dimassaalso spent much of the race within the back half of the top ten with Charlie finishing eighth and Vincent tenth.Ben Kossknew where he sat in the field throughout the race and moved up along the way from outside the top ten to finish ninth.

2019 Vibram Hong Kong 100k Results,"The story of the 2019Vibram Hong Kong 100klooks to be that of another set of breakout international performances for mainland Chinese ultrarunners. While past years have showcased the likes ofLong-Fei Yan,Dong Li,Yiao Mao, andMin Qi, this year’s race could be the rest of the world’s first notice that race winnersYangchun LuandJiasheng Shenare forces to be reckoned with. While not a scorcher weather wise, it was warm and humid and a bit toasty when the sun cracked through the cloud layer for an hour or two midday. That combination was enough to challenge many runners, especially those coming from cooler climes. Still, the highly varied, yet unrelenting course was the true test. Both during and after the race, some runners would highlight the difficulty of the highly runnable sections early in the race, while others would wince at the challenging cement stairs that dominated the climbs and descents. Read on below to find out how the race played out up front. Thanks toKailasfor sponsoring our coverage of the Vibram Hong Kong 100k. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. What a fun race to watch! I watch many races every year and this was one of the most exciting I’ve seen in a while. Through the first third of the race, 2015 championLong-Fei Yanand first to cross the line in 2018 (but later DQed)Jing Liang(post-race interview) led the race withTom Evanschasing not far behind.Zhenlong ZhangandJiasheng Shen(post-race interview) ran two and two-and-a-half minutes back at 34 kilometers, as the only other runners within five minutes of the lead with only two more within 10 minutes of the front. Honestly, it looked like a three-man game between Yan, Liang, and Owens. At 57km, Liang and Yan were racing at breakneck speed in the front, both pushing hard. And Evans… he was out, withdrawn for a yet-unknown-to-me reason. So, seemingly one of two men, racing hard at the front, would be the day’s victor. But, that Shen guy was flying, too, and only two minutes back. The next four runners were all Chinese, but none was within nine minutes of the front. Jing Liang leads at 57km with Long-Fei Yan in tow. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Not much later we get a note and confirm via GPS tracking… Yan is walking with an injury. He pulls out at the next checkpoint. It’s now one man at the front. At 70km, Liang holds the lead. Could redemption be his after last year’s finish-line disqualification? Ah, but Shen runs by just 30 seconds later. At 82km, Liang’s doubled that lead to a full minute, but Shen looks the fresher of the two. What’s this? GPS shows Liang’s off course? Yes, and Shen’s in the lead for several hundred meters? Oh, what heartbreak Liang must feel, but he quickly turns around and closes in. Ah, but it’s not to be. Jiashen Shen builds his lead to four minutes over Liang at the final checkpoint with 10km to go and, then, extends that lead to nearly 14 minutes by the finish.

The two runners came to those positions a bit differently, with Zhang running closer to the front in the race’s first third, while Deng wasn’t in the top 10 at 22km.

Full results. On his birthday, Scotty Hawker takes fifth. Photo: Paper Pongsubkarun On the women’s side, the race was allYangchun Lu(post-race interview) of mainland China, who was making her 100km debut. Lu had a 30-second lead on Switzerland’sJasmin Nunigeafter the speedy first 12km. Lu’s gap on Nunige grew to four minutes at 22km and 10 minutes at 34km. Lu looked in control all day, often stopping for a few minutes to calmly eat and drink in the checkpoints. After the race, she credited her conscientious fueling to advice she receive a day before from last year’s champion Yiao Mao. That advice paid off Lu won by more than half an hour, while never seeming to falter along the way. Yangchun Lu on her way to winning the 2019 Vibram Hong Kong 100k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Nunige would continue to follow Lu in second until shortly before the 50km mark when last year’s third-place womanFuzhao Xiang(post-race interview) took over second, a position she wouldn’t give up the rest of the day. Nunige would slowly lose positions through the remainder of the race, eventually finishing sixth. China’sGuangmei Yangwould gradually move in the opposite direction through the race until she passed Nunige to move into third between 51 and 57km. Also from China,Meiling Xuran in fifth for much of the race until she, too, passed Nunige, thereby moving into her fourth-place finishing position. Running in fourth early,Ekaterina Mityaevadropped to sixth around mid-race before moving up into fifth roughly around the 90km mark. While there were significant drops at the top of the men’s field (including Tom Evans,Dylan Bowman, and Long-Fei Yan), the women’s field held together with (as best as I can tell) no woman running in the top 10 from the 12km mark on withdrawing from the race.

2019 Western States 100 Lottery Results (Plus Auto-Entrants),"The lottery for the 2019Western States 100took place yesterday, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. However, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. This year’s lottery saw a 19% increase in applicants over last year. The starters list in June 2019 will ultimately contain 369 runners, a number decided by the race’s permit through the Granite Chief Wilderness Area. Among this there will be 102automatic entrants(some decided and some yet to be decided, see below for details), three that were drawn from those who were in the live audience for the lottery itself, and 262 runners who were chosen in yesterday’s lottery. A change was announced to the WS 100 entrance process in 2016, and will be implemented for the third time in the 2019 event, a 50-person General Waitlist. If a registered entrant decides not to race, members of the waitlist will move onto the entrants list. Yesterday, that waitlist was also filled from among the lottery entrants as well. For perspective, in last year’s use of the waitlist, it went 36 deep in offering waitlist members spots in the race. The WS 100 website has anup-to-date list of the 2019 Western States 100 entrantsand will have a separate list for waitlisted runners. Let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into WS 100 so far. The women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2019 as automatic entries, and all 10 women have chosen to do so: The men’s top 10 from 2018are also invitedto return with auto-entries, and all but one intend to do so: According to UltraSignup, 81 of the 102 auto-entry slots were filled ahead of the race, with 19 of those being top-10 returnees from last year. Below are some speedy women and men who have already achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methodsso far: Women Men A total of 262 names were drawn during yesterday’s lottery, and among them were a small number of speedy and notable athletes. Men Women Top runners still have two routes by which they can gain automatic entry into the 2019 WS 100. The five-race 2019Altra Golden Ticket Raceswill offer up to 20 WS 100 entries to be given to top finishers of these races. The top-two men and top-two women finishers of each race gain entry, and if they already have an entry or if they decline it, the entry can roll down as far as fifth place. Here’s the race-series schedule for 2019: Related articles:"
2019 Hardrock Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2019Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run! This article breaks down the results of yesterday’s lottery for the run’s 2019 edition. Let’s start with some statistics and background information. This year’s lottery entrants list was up to 2,488 applicants. For perspective, the 2018 lottery had 2,236 entrants, the 2017 lottery 1,966 entrants, and the 2016 lottery 1,549 applicants. These 2,488 entrants were represented by 18,071 total tickets, which went into today’s lottery buckets. For perspective, last year’s total ticket pool was 12,357 tickets. Prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants into one of three divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with Hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. The divisions are Veterans, runners who’ve finished Hardrock five or more times; Nevers, who are runners who’ve never finished Hardrock; and Everyone Else (or, more simply, “Else” below), runners who’ve started the event and finished between one and four times. For the 2019 lottery, there were 37 Veteran applicants who had 362 tickets, 2,222 Never applicants with 16,818 tickets, and 229 Else applicants with 891 tickets. Looking back at last year’s lottery, there were 43 Veteran applicants who had 422 tickets, 1,975 Never applicants with 11,127 tickets, and 218 Else applicants with 808 tickets. (Note that a runner’s ticket in the Never pool are subject exponential increase, not the simple increase by addition as in the other two pools.) The 2019 event will start 145 runners. Today, the event organization selected 33 Veterans, 45 Nevers, and 67 Elses. Of the 145 entrants chosen, up to five were chosen ahead of time by the race by Run DirectorDale Garland, which were announced among the names chosen in the lottery. In addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into three separate division-specific waitlists. For perspective, in 2018, 3 people got off the Veteran waitlist and into the race, 6 people from the Never waitlist, and 24 people from the Else waitlist. For the 2017 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrant spots 10 deep in the Veteran division, 9 deep in the Never division, and 6 deep in the Else division. For the 2016 edition, the waitlist went to 4 deep for the Veterans (which included all of the Veterans on the waitlist that year), 4 deep for Never, and 8 deep for Else. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is, in reality, competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which Hardrock prides itself upon. Below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2019 contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in. Let’s start with the men’s race, which is by far the most competitively loaded field in Hardrock history.Xavier Thévenardwas pulled in the lottery again this year after a dramatic lead and equally dramatic disqualification at mile 90 during last year’s Hardrock for taking aid outside of the station. He’ll be challenged by four-time winner and the holder of both course recordsKilian Jornet,2016’s co-championJason Schlarb,and 2018’s championJeff Browning. Throw in 3-time UTMB championFrançois D’Haeneand 2-time Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji championDylan Bowman, both of whom will be making their Hardrock debut. Should the race-day conditions be even remotely favorable, it would seem like counterclockwise course record of 23:28:10 set by Kilian in 2015 will be in play. The 2018 women’s championSabrina Stanleyhas elected to use her auto-entry to return this year, and her competition with likely come from from Swiss runnerAndrea Huserwho seems to either win or podium at every highly competitive European race she starts, as well as 2018 Western States championCourtney Dauwalterwho excels in brutally difficult races. Throw in three-time Hardrock championDarcy Piceu, who is on a roll with 100 mile victories and has, by far, the most experience at this race with seven finishes no worse than runner-up. There is only one way to gain an auto-entry into Hardrock, and that is by winning last year’s addition. Jeff Browning will be returning to defend his title in 2019. Below are the notable men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Original full entrants list. Here are the notable women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Original full entrants list. (This year, we’re only listing runners on the top 25 of the Else waitlist and top 10 of the Never and Veteran waitlists.

2018 Ring of Steall Skyrace Results,"The 2018Ring of SteallSkyrace, run on a technical 29-kilometer(18-mile) route bearing 2,500 meters (8,200 feet) of elevation gain in the Scottish Highlands, was the site of both the Skyrunning World Championships in the Sky discipline as well as race number five and final qualifying race in the Golden Trail Series, sothe ten women and men qualifying for the finalin South Africa are now set. Under cool but relatively fair skies at low altitudes and in the clouds up on the ridgetops (for the leaders, as it rained later in the day) Sweden’sTove Alexandersson, already one of the world’s best at orienteering, broke out big in mountain running to win the stacked women’s race, and Spain’sKilian Jornetadded another win to his lengthy 2018 victory list.

This was an absolutely stacked field, with the entrants lists filled with women who had won a lot of different kinds of races all over the world. But the Ring of Steall is not just any race, with its highly technical, muddy, and lots-of-elevation-change course, so the winner would be someone with a specific and particular skill set. The women’s race went out fast, really fast. A group of four women, with a fifth just a few seconds behind, arrived in first together at the five-kilometer point. This group included Sweden’sLina El Kott, Spain’sLaura Orgué(pre-race interview), England’sVictoria Wilkinson(post-race interview), and Sweden’sTove Alexandersson. The lonely runner just behind at this point was Spain’sSheila Avilés. After a two-minute gap, it was England’sHolly Page(pre-race interview), Spain’sSandra Sevillano, Japan’sTakako Takamura, Italy’sSilvia Rampazzo, and France’sCéline Lafayeall basically together. Sweden’sSanna El Kottwas not far away. At this point, all of the runners  looked great. The big climb, ridge run, and wicked downhill to the 12k mark, down in Glen Nevis, broke the field up quite a bit. A hard-charging Alexandersson, a multi-time orienteering and ski-orienteering world champion, now had a two-minute lead in front of everyone else. In a field of world-class athletes, was she truly in her own class today? Time–and some more kilometers–would tell. Avilés ran in second there while Wilkinson held steady in third. A bit further back was Page in fourth, Orgué in fifth, and a pack of six women running mostly together including Lafaye, Sevillano, Lina El Kott, the USA’sDenali Foldager-Strabel, Takamura, and Rampazzo. Tove Alexandersson, 2018 Ring of Steall Skyrace Champion. Indeed, Alexandersson would keep on charging, continuing to put distance on her rivals, absolutely flying down the hill at the 24k mark. By the finish, she’d destroyed the old course record by almost 20 minutes to win the 2018 Ring of Steall Skyrace and become the Syrunning World Champion in the Sky distance. Along the way, she fell and cut her left hand badly. Wilkinson used her local experience in these sorts of races to move up on the field and finish second, though she finished some 7.5 minutes back from the winner. Page nailed the last part of the race, showing that her good season is still on, to finish third. Victoria Wilkinson on her way to second place. Avilés ran way faster than her time here last year to finish fourth, despite falling and gashing her leg pretty good. Orgué ran under her own course record and finished fifth. Sweden’sFanny Borgströmhad a great second half of the race to finish sixth. These top-six women all ran under the old course record! Then, Sevillano finished in seventh place, Lafaye in eighth, Spain’sOihana Azkorbebeitiamoved up late to take ninth, and Takamura rounded the women’s top 10. Holly Page would take third at the 2018 Ring of Steall Skyrace. Full results. Aswe previewed, it was going to be a competitive men’s race. Unsurprisingly, the leading train at five kilometers into the race was packed, and headed by Switzerland’sRémi Bonnet. Running right with him, though, were Spain’sKilian Jornet(post-race interview) and Italy’sNadir Maguet(post-race interview). Just a few seconds back, the rest of the wagons included England’sSebastian Batchelor, Switzerland’sPascal Egli, Poland’sBartłomiej Przedwojewski, France’sAlexis Sévennec, the USA’sSage Canaday, and Spain’sAritz Egea. And there were probably 10 more guys within just a few seconds. Kilian Jornet and Nadir Maguet leading the 2018 Ring of Steall Skyrace together. It wasn’t until the first big ridgeline that things started to split up. Down in Glen Nevis, 12k into the race, Jornet and Maguet had taken the joint lead, were pushing each other, and had gapped the rest of the field. The next group, over two minutes back, included Egli, Przedwojewski, and Sévennec. Running alone there, probably a minute back from that chase pack, but looking well was the last edition’s champion and course-record holder, Norway’sStian Angermund-Vik(pre-race interview). Bonnet had fallen to seventh place, Switzerland’sMarc Lauensteinand Spain’sOriol Cardonawere eighth and ninth, and Batchelor rounded out the top 10. Kilian Jornet, 2018 Ring of Steall Skyrace Champion. On the last descent, with around 5k to go, we spotted Jornet looking over his shoulder, trying to see if Maguet was still there. And he was. Just a couple steps behind him, in fact. From there, Jornet made a final attack to cross the line in first, smash the course record by 20 minutes, and earn the 2018 Skyrunning World Champion title in the Sky division. With some blood on his chin at the finish line but not at the 5k-to-go point, Jornet would later say he took a tumble at the end–he’s fine, though. Maguet was second as he finished just over a minute behind Jornet in an incredible breakout race for him. Angermund-Vik kept moving up in the field, finishing in third, looking like he was enjoying himself the whole way. Nadir Maguet celebrates his second-place finish. Sévennec sprinted on the last descent with Egli, the duo claiming fourth and fifth, respectively. Przedwojewski was sixth, the Swiss guys Bonnet and Lauenstein ended up seventh and eighth, Batchelor was ninth, and Spain’sJan Margaritsqueezed into the top 10. Incredibly, all top-10 men–top 11 to be precise–ran under the old course record. Stian Angermund-Vik on his way to third place. Full results.

2018 IAU 100k World Championships Results," With a latest-race surge, Japan’sHideaki Yamauchiwon the 2018IAU 100k World Championshipsmen’s race to become a two-time 100k world champion. In the women’s race, Croatia’sNikolina Šustićwon via early race conservation and then emerging as the leader after halfway, bettering her runner-up performance at the event’s previous edition. In the men’s team race, Japan was absolutely dominant, taking home the gold medal with their first, second, and fourth-place finishes. Japan’s women were equally dominant in the women’s team race, taking home gold via their team members finishing in third, fourth, and fifth. Both the men’s and women’s Japanese teams had four total finishers in the top 10. The picturesque northern Croatian town of Sveti Martin na Muri hosted the 2018 IAU 100k World Championships. It was a slightly unusual course for a 100-kilometer world championships, which are usually hosted on flat routes. This course netted about 800 meters (2,600 feet) of climb over 100k via constant hills. The course was made up of one initial 2.5km out-and-back followed by 13 out-and-backs that were 7.5km in length. With a7 a.m.race start, the weather was initially nice for running, with temperatures in the mid-20s Celsius (mid-70s Fahrenheit), partly cloudy skies, and a slight breeze. But high humidity was a key factor all day, and also, after about five hours, the clouds cleared and the temperature rose to 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). Read on to see how the rest of the race unfolded. Thanks toSquirrel’s Nut Butterfor jumping in at the last minute to sponsor our coverage of the IAU 100k World Championships!

Individual Race Beforehand, we knew both South Africa and Japan were the country favorites, and the groups from which individual medalists were likely to emerge. We also expected runners from these countries to push the pace. Turns out, only some of this happened. Early race, it was runners from neither of these countries who were actually leading: insert the names of the USA’sGeoff Burns(pre-race interview) and Great Britain’sLee Granthamhere. While Lee Grantham would fade early and ultimately drop, Geoff Burns maintained a pace-setting role until after the 40km point, saying after the race that he thought the men had gone out slow and that someone should keep the pace honest. When the passel of men from South Africa and Japan finally surged hard somewhere around midway, Geoff relinquished the pace-setting and settled in for the rest of the ride. Great Britain’s Lee Grantham, the USA’s Geoff Burns, and Japan’s Takehiko Gyoba leading the 2018 IAU 100k World Championships early on. Around the 60km mark is where the race really started to change and the big group that had been running together started to string out. One of the men’s race favorites, South Africa’sBongmusa Mthembu(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took the lead and left the main group along with bothTakehiko Gyoba(post-race interview) andHideaki Yamauchi(post-race interview), both of Japan. Behind them, it was Japan’sNao Kazami(pre-race interview) holding in fourth place withKoji Hayasaka, also from Japan, close to now-fifth-place Geoff Burns. South Africa’sBest Ngwenyawas chasing with fellow countrymatesThusio Mosiea,Nkosinathi Duma, andClaude Moshiywa. Now, indeed, Japan and South Africa were pushing hard and working with their fellow countrymen. Japan’s Hideaki Yamauchi and South Africa’s Bongmusa Mthembu leading together after the halfway point. Around this point in the race, it was easy to identify some men who were still outside the top 10 but looking strong–the runners most likely to move up. These men included Sweden’sFritjof Fagerlund, Italy’sGiorgio Calcaterra, and Sweden’sElov Olsson. It was, thus, not long until the South African foursome of Best Ngwenya, Thusio Mosiea, Nkosinathi Duma, and Claude Moshiywa faded and was passed by these very men. Thusio Mosiea held things together the best to finish 14th, Best Ngwenya also finished strong in 16th, Nkosinathi Duma did not finish, and Claude Moshiywa slipped way back to 44th. The fact that he’s 46 years old did not prevent Italy’s Giorgio Calcaterra from running to seventh place. Then-race leader Bongmusa Mthembu’s perfect stride and steady gaze suddenly changed with two laps to go. At the 85km point, he looked for the first time like he was working to maintain pace. And by the 92.5k mark, Japan’s Hideaki Yamauchi, also the event’s defending champion, had surged to take over the lead and Bongmusa faded, in a replay of their 2016 World Championships showdown. Hideaki held his lead for the final lap to become the 2018 IAU 100k World Champion. The race’s dominance by Japan was only starting, though, as Takehiko Gyoba crossed the line in second place, though more than 4.5 minutes behind the winner. Bongmusa Mthembu held on for third, crossing the line less than a minute later. Hideaki Yamauchi, 2018 IAU 100k World Champion. Koji Hayasaka finished fourth. Geoff Burns took fifth after emerging at the front of a three-person final sprint between he, Nao Kazami, and Giorgio Calcaterra. It was one of the most impressive final efforts we saw all day. The USA’s Geoff Burns beating Japan’s Nao Kazami to the line in a sprint finish while Italy’s Giorgio Calcaterra also approaches a couple seconds back. These three men took fifth, sixth, and seventh. The back half of the men’s top 10 was exciting until the finish. Sixth-place Nao Kazami had a fascinating race after being in the lead pack, falling to almost 20th place, and coming back to finish sixth. The ageless Giorgio Calcaterra–he’s actually 46 years old–ran one of the smartest races of the day, being far away from the lead in the early kilometers to finish seventh looking fresh and bright. It was a similar story for Great Britain’sAnthony Clark, who took eighth but waited until the second-to-last lap to move into the top 10–and in doing so he even eluded iRunFar’s two sets of race-coverage eyes until his finish. Fritjof Fagerlund and Elov Olsson took Sweden into the top 10 as they finished in ninth and 10th, respectively. Great Britain’s Anthony Clark still had a lot of energy as he took eighth. Team Race It’s the cumulative time of the top-three finishers of each country that scores the team race. Japan was the team gold medalists by a country mile–or shall we say the Croatian kilometer. Their combined time of 19:37:01 was scored from their teammates finishing in first (Hideaki Yamauchi), second (Takehiko Gyoba), and fourth (Koji Hayasaka) places. Despite going out hard and fading some late race, the South African men finished firmly with the silver team medal via a combined time of 20:33:49 from third (Bongmusa Mthembu), 14th (Thusio Mosiea), and 16th (Best Ngwenya) place finishers. Germany was the surprise team medalist, and they took bronze with a cumulative time of 21:02:12 from 12th (Alexander Dautel), 17th (André Collet), and 23rd (Karsten Fischer) place runners. The 2018 IAU 100k World Championships men’s individual podium (l-to-r): 3. Bongmusa Mthembu, 2. Takehiko Gyoba, 1. Hideaki Yamauchi Individual Results Team Results Full results. Individual Race On the first out-and-backs, it was a monologue of the Czech Republic’sRadka Churáňová. She set the pace, looking smooth and opening a small gap to her immediate followers, Croatia’s ownNikolina Šustić(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Germany’sNele Alder-Baerens(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). All three of them moved independently, however, keeping steady paces and looking at ease with the early kilometers. A bit further back, Finland’sNoora Honkalaheld fourth position and Japan’sMai Fujisawa(post-race interview)showed up in the top five. Moving around the back of the top 10 wereLuiza Tobarfrom Brazil,Marija Vrajićfrom Croatia, Great Britain’sSamantha Amend, Sweden’sKajsa Berg, and the USA’sDevon Yanko(pre-race interview). Early race leader, the Czech Republic’s Radka Churáňová, would later fade and drop from the race. Germany’s Nele Alder-Baerens ran her own race and took second. Croatia’s Nikolina Šustić, 2018 IAU 100k World Champion. Japan’s Mai Fujisawa ran a steady race inside the women’s top five all day to take third place. Noora Honkala, of Finland, had a breakout race to finish in eighth place. Sweden’s Kajsa Berg smiling toward her top-10 finish. Team Race Again, it’s the cumulative time of the top-three finishers of each country that scores the team race. The women’s team race wasn’t event close, withJapanan absolute team winner with a23:03:50 total time earned via their third (Mai Fujisawa), fourth (Mikiko Ota), and fifth (Aiko Kanematsu) place finishers. The women of South Africa took team silver with a cumulative time of23:56:44 from runners finishing in seventh (Salome Cooper), 14th (Fikile Mbuthuma), and 19th (Lisa Collet). The ‘home team,’ Croatia, earned the bronze medal with a cumulative time of24:13:57 via first (Nikolina Šustić), 18th (Veronika Jurišić), and 46th (Antonija Orlić) places.

2018 UTMB Results,"France’sXavier Thévenardtook home his third win while Italy’sFrancesca Canepaearned her first victory atUTMB2018. The men’s and women’s fields faced challenging weather conditions paired with hyper-dynamic competition, which together required not only strong physical performances but perhaps even stronger psychological performances of these champions. In the men’s race, emergent Romanian runnerRobert Hajnalhad the race of his life to take second, while Spain’sJordi Gamitoracked up perhaps his biggest performance among a number of big performances over the years to take third. For the women, it was Spain’sUxue Frailewho returned from major injury to her previous form to take second, and France’sJocelyne Pauly, who battled long and late in a close women’s podium race for third, her top ultra-trail race result by far. In a race that was informed in great part by a decimation of the frontrunner field–especially on the men’s side–it was hard to track exactly how many lead shifts happened over the course of the day or so of Alpine trail racing. In our results articles, we typically talk about those who had their best days at the front of the race. With so very many drops among the men’s favorites, a conversation about those who didn’t make it seems warranted, too. First things first, we’ll start at the top of the women’s and men’s fields and, then, work our way down. A special thanks toCamelbakfor making our coverage of UTMB possible!

Your support helps make iRunFar happen. Thank you! The fog rises above La Fouly, Switzerland at dawn. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Let’s begin with two important and race-informing facts: What a year for the upper-echelon women at UTMB! Italy’sFrancesca Canepa(post-race interview), she’s probably a name that newer fans of international trail ultrarunning don’t recognize. In looking through her decade or so of trail and ultrarunning race results, you might think that on paper she’d reached her ultrarunning peak in the 2012 to 2014 range. For instance, in 2012, she went back-to-back to take second at (one of the weather-shortened versions of) UTMB and, then, win Tor des Géants a couple weeks later. But here we all are in 2018 with a UTMB champ in Francesca. What we also have in Francesca is a woman who didn’t slow down while surrounded by a field of women who did, and her speed and pace results on the race tracker phenomenally demonstrate this. Her lowest ranking in the overall field was 157th place at Saint-Gervais (21km), and her best was at the finish when she was 33rd overall. Francesca moved inside the women’s top 10 between the descent from Col de la Seigne into Italy (at around 65km) and her hometown of Courmayeur (80km). The rest was history as woman by woman, she passed them all, until she arrived to the 135km checkpoint as the women’s leader. Her gap to the other women was never big–less than five minutes at the finish–but it was plenty for her arrival as the 2018 champ. Francesca Canepa at La Fouly in Switzerland at dawn on Saturday, on her way to winning UTMB 2018. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I’m not going to lie, Spain’sUxue Fraile(pre-andpost-race interviews) is always a force to be reckoned with. But she’d been injured for a long time, so going into this year’s UTMB, I was unsure if she’d be back to her previous form. When I caught a glimpse of her in Chamonix a couple days before the race, I was sure she’d compete for the podium. Holy smokes, was she fit! Early race, Uxue was smack dab in the middle of the women’s top 10, in fifth at 21km. From there until about 124km, Uxue’s position in the women’s top five shifted around. At Les Chapieux (50km), she was second, while at Grand Col Ferret (90km), she was fourth. This was the result of women coming and going from in front of her, time and again. She would say after the race that the fluidity with which women moved in front of and, then, behind her was actually sort of confusing, in terms of the sheer number of times it happened and who those runners were. By 140km, she settled into second place, where she would stay. Ultimately, she caused a little excitement as she cut over half her deficit to the lead in a couple kilometers over the race’s final 10km, on the steep descent to Chamonix from La Flégère. But when the route flattened out again with a couple kilometers to go, her pace evened out relative to that of Francesca in front of her, and the pair finished about 4.5 minutes apart. Uxue Fraile elated with second place at UTMB 2018. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Third-placeJocelyne Pauly(post-race interview) of France was this year’s women’s breakout runner. She’s been a strong ultrarunner for a number of years, but this was far and away her strongest result–by a country (or Alpine?!) mile. A mom and an educator living in the French Pyrenees, Jocelyne was unaffected by the difficult weather conditions which persisted for most of the first 12 hours of the race, including rain, frozen precipitation, and cold temperatures. As early as 21km into the race, Jocelyne was well inside the top 10. She said after the race that this positioning surprised her, but that she went with it since it felt good. She was still outside podium position at the start of the final climb, and once she moved her way into third place, she said that her competitive instinct made her want to fight for that spot. The women’s podium of UTMB 2018 (l-to-r): 2. Uxue Fraile, 1. Francesca Canepa, 3. Jocelyne Pauly. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Fourth place was the U.K.’sBeth Pascall, who put on what looks like a textbook performance, running outside the women’s top 10 to start, easing into it mid-race, before coming on strong in the final 25km to move up from seventh to fourth place. Rounding out the women’s top five was Italy’sKatia Fori, who was one of those people whose position in the race moved around, from higher, to lower, to higher, and to lower again. At one point she was actually leading the race before she ultimately finished fifth. Katia Fori running toward fifth place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell In sixth was France’sJuliette Blanchet, who avenged last year’s DNF with a strong 2018 finish. Seventh place was the always-impressiveIldikó Wermescher(post-race interview) of Hungary. The USA’sCat Bradleytook eighth. Bulgaria’sMariya Nikolova(pre-race interview) took ninth for the second year in a row. The USA’sKaci Lickteig, who sat outside the women’s top 10 until the final kilometers, sprinted it in for 10th place. Drops were an influential part of the storyline of both the women’s and men’s races, though as we shall see below, the DNF influence was really heavy among the men. iRunFar had 34 women in its preview who actually ended up starting the race, and I believe that 12 of them didn’t finish, a 35% drop rate. There were 782 DNFs among 2,561 total starters, a 31% overall drop rate. So the frontrunner women’s DNF rate was a little higher than the average drop rate for the whole field. Interestingly, seven of those 12 women were from the USA. Mimmi Kotka was one of the women’s favorites, but she dropped in Les Contamines, early in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Full results. To be honest, I think a number of us wondered aboutXavier Thévenard’s(pre-andpost-race interviews) ability to recover from both those 91 miles of the Hardrock 100 that he did run as well as the psychological outwash of the nine miles he didn’t with his disqualification a scant six weeks ago. But if there was any lingering fatigue, you couldn’t see it. He was solid all day long, not only efficient in his trail time, but also efficient in his aid-station transitions. And he also kept his cool as lead change after lead change happened around him until there was just him left. Sometimes it’s hard to tell if Xavier enjoys what he does when he’s out there–he’s a quiet guy who keeps his thoughts to himself and the emotions off his face. But he let his feelings out at the finish with a sweet celebration. At the outset and for something like half the race, Xavier sat in the middle of the top 10. Then, from about midway up until the 50-kilometers-to-go mark, he moved up until he eventually was the solo race leader starting at Champex-Lac (124km). His lead was modest at first, but he really opened it up in the final race segments, ultimately winning by some 45 minutes. Xavier Thévenard, UTMB 2018 champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Second-placeRobert Hajnal(post-race interview), of Romania… wait, stop the ‘press.’ Who’s that? I know, I know, iRunFar has a small yet passionate collection of Romanian readers who did know of this guy before this weekend, but the rest of us, let’s get to know Robert. I took notice of him when he finished 15th at the 2018 Trail World Championships, but his accolades go farther back than that. Last year, he earned a pair of fifth places at the Lavaredo Ultra Trail and Ultra-Trail Cape Town. The first time Robert caught my attention at this race was in the dark, cold, wind, and below-freezing temperatures on the descent from Col de la Seigne on the border of France and Italy, at about 65km. He was bundled up enough that it was hard to figure out who he was while he ran just outside of the men’s top 10. The next time we saw him in the bustling Courmayeur aid station (80km), he’d passed a bunch of people and moved solidly into the lead group. That’s where he stayed all day, moving up sequentially until, after 124km, he found his ultimate finishing position. Our eyes are squarely on you now, Robert. What’s your next move? Robert Hajnal after taking second at UTMB 2018. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sJordi Gamito(post-race interview) has a lot of feathers of success adorning his trail-ultrarunning hat from the last half-decade-plus of high-level ultrarunning. I believe he had two previous finishes of 12th and 10th places at UTMB to his name, as well as podium finishes at other important races. At the finish line, Jordi said that earning a UTMB podium position was like a dream to him, something he’d thought a lot about, but thought he might never achieve. Well, Jordi, dreams do come true! Like Xavier and Robert in front of him, Jordi started out a little conservatively, and got closer to the front of the race as time went on. He found his third-place position with about 60km to go, and he never was closely challenged for it, nor did he challenge for a higher ranking. This year, the podium is his. Jordi Gamito celebrates his third place with the crowd gathered at the UTMB 2018 finish line. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Here we go, Norway’sHallvard Schjølberg, who are you? He’s the dude who took 28th place at UTMB last year and fourth place this year. Talk about some improvement! Hallvard was a quintessential honey badger, never really caring about or being bothered by difficult conditions, soldiering on in it all. Rounding out the men’s top five was the U.K.’sDamian Hall(post-race interview). Check out his UTMB progression: 29th in 2015, 19th in 2016, 12th last year, and, now, this. With such significant leaps forward, the only question is what his UTMB ceiling might be. Damian Hall on his way to fifth place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Sixth place was LatvianRoman Evarts, who turned up in the men’s top 10 at 124km, after running over half the race in 20th-30th place overall. Seventh was Italy’sStefano Ruzza, who employed the same move-up strategy, though not entering the top 10 until even later.Erik Clavery, of France, surprised me. I tend to think of him as a relatively aggressive runner who sometimes sticks it and sometimes doesn’t. I was, thus, surprised to see him taking it easier early and running around 20th place before watching him turn up in the top 10 later in the race. Austria’sFlorian Graselfinished ninth, and Spain’sJavi Domingueztook 10th. To put it mildly, there were some DNFs in the men’s field. At quick count, it looks like there were 25 drops from the 39 men in our preview who ultimately started the race, or a 64% drop rate among iRunFar’s men’s favorites. This statistic sits in stark contrast to the race’s overall drop rate of 31%. Some of those drops were the result of weird stuff, like a pre-race bee sting that manifested in mid-race health issues for three-time championKilian Jornet, as well as during-race slips, trips, and ankle rolls that created race-ending injuries forTim Tollefson(pre-race interview) who’s taken third at UTMB twice, previous second-place-finisherLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-race interview), andAlex Nicholswho was debuting at UTMB but who has a plenty-strong racing resume. This is a significant number, sure, but there’s still much more to the story, and that has to be the general wear and tear of running 100 miles in difficult weather conditions catching up with a lot of men, including two-time top-10erZach Miller(pre-race interview) who I also think hurt his ankle after going into the energetic hurt bucket,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) who was fifth last year, three-time top-10erGediminus Grinius,Scotty Hawkerwho was last year’s 11th-place finisher, and more.

2018 Hardrock 100 Results,"The 25th edition of theHardrock 100took place on July 20th to the 22nd, 2018 in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado under the Rocky Mountains’ typically tempestuous monsoon-season skies. Event participants had 48 hours to traverse the 100.5-mile loop made up of dirt roads, old mining trails, singletrack, and game trails at an average altitude of 11,000 feet and accumulating 33,000-plus feet of climb. The run switches direction each year, and ‘even’ years like this one bring about the clockwise direction of travel. Following the disqualification of all-race leaderXavier Thévenard(pre-race interview) for receiving aid outside of an aid station in violation of event rules,Jeff Browning(pre– andpost-raceinterviews) took home the men’s win. Thévenard’s DQ was a first in the history of the event and, perhaps almost unbelievably, the first of two DQs at this year’s running. (The second of which was after a mid-pack competitor inadvertently left the course during a thunderstorm and didn’t choose to return to the spot from which they deviated to continue on, which is required by the race rules.) In the women’s race,Sabrina Stanley(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) ran gutsy and off the front to take home the women’s win in her debut at the event. She was followed by ultrarunning iconNikki Kimball(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) in second place, who was also debuting at Hardrock. After relatively calm but warm weather for first 36 hours of the event–save for a brief storm about 14 hours into the race that only a few leaders experienced–violent thunderstorms filled the skies above the final 20 miles of the course for about two hours on the second evening. A dozen or so participants hunkered down in the lowest places they could find during them, and all made it through safely. Australia’sAndy Hewatwas the year’s final finisher, crossing the line in 47:56:14, with this finish his fifth at Hardrock.

France’sXavier Thévenard(pre-race interview) raced from the word ‘go’ and was out in front of the men’s field as early as a half mile into the event. From the start until roughly at Telluride, mile 28, Thévenard not only traveled alone and way in front of the rest of the men, but also at under course-record pace. On the long climb out of Telluride to the iconic Kroger’s Canteen, nestled in a tight pass at over 13,000 feet in elevation, Thévenard’s pace settled into what was certainly fast for the Hardrock course, but slower than record pace. Even so, his lead on the men’s field continued to increase, such that at Sherman, mile 72, he was more than 90 minutes ahead of anyone else. Thévenard arrived at the Cunningham aid station, mile 91, at the race’s lead, too. However, at Cunningham, Thévenard was disqualified after discussions with the race organization about a confirmed rules breach back before the course’s halfway point, two miles after the Ouray aid station, mile 44, where he was aided by his crew with ice and water, which is disallowed by the event’s rules.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks After the event, race directorDale Garlandtold iRunFar that following a bystander report of a possible rules breach, the organization researched what happened, asked questions of both Thévenard and his crew at three different aid stations–two of these interactions were observed by iRunFar–and conferred with the organization’s rules committee before the incident’s culmination in Cunningham Gulch. Post-event, Thévenard told iRunFar that he, indeed, admits to taking aid outside an aid station, but that he felt the disqualification was a disproportionate penalty for the rule he broke.Tony Russwas the bystander who reported the rules breach to the race organization, and he told iRunFar after the event that he observed Thévenard receiving aid in the form of water to drink and his crew members doing something with his pack. [Editor’s Note:We have publishedanother articlewhich details this disqualification. We have been told by the race organization that they have plans to release a more in-depth report, as well.] As all this happened,Jeff Browning(pre– andpost-raceinterviews), who had run in second place nearly the whole day (and night), went through the Maggie Gulch aid station, mile 85, thinking he was, indeed, in second place. However, when he arrived to Cunningham a bit later, he found himself at the head of the race. Not only that but second-placeJeff Rome(post-race interview) was hot on his heels, leaving the Cunningham aid station just 6.5 minutes behind. The gentlemen could both see the other and hear the small gathered crowd’s early morning cheering for both of them. A race of the Jeffs was on. But we should back up, say, 91 miles. As early as the Mineral Creek crossing, mile 2, Jeff Browning crossed in second place with a long tail of men trailing him. This pattern continued for miles, with what looked like Browning doing his thing and that thing amounting to him essentially leading the men’s chase pack. While he mostly looked at ease in his effort, he would later say that he both felt the fact that he ran the Western States 100 just four weeks ago and that he struggled with motivation because he couldn’t make up time on the lead. After the race, he also said he got confused for a spell in the vicinity of Cataract Lake, mile 75, when he couldn’t see course markings and wandered back and forth for a bit. HisGPStracker indicates his wanderings amounted to perhaps 2.5 extra miles. Browning eventually encounteredTroy Howard(pre-andpost-raceinterviews)  who was at the time in third place, approaching from behind. Together they sorted his confusion, and headed on. Browning said he surged in the miles following his encounter with Howard to gain a new gap. Jeff Browning at the top of the first climb, at mile 7, during the 2018 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Alex McGeorge Jeff Rome turned heads at Hardrock last year when he finished in seventh place in 28:53. He would say after the race that his goal this year was to run under 28 hours. By 18 miles into the race, Rome was courting with the men’s top 10 and, at Telluride, mile 28, he settled into seventh position, the same position he finished in 2017 and a position he’d hold until after mile 58. And, then, the magic started happening as he moved up from seventh to third in the 27 miles that followed. He, too, was surprised to arrive to Cunningham and find out that, not only was he in second place, but he was also just a few minutes off the lead. He went up the final climb chasing Jeff Browning as hard as he could. In the end, the two Jeffs maintained their order, with Jeff Browning as the men’s champion and Jeff Rome in second place, a huge step up from his original goal. Jeff Rome takes second at the 2018 Hardrock 100 in a finish sprint. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Troy Howard(pre-race interview) is slowly filling out all the finishing positions at the front of Hardrock. He came into this year’s race with two prior second-place finishes and a fifth, too. In a cursory way, Howard’s and Rome’s early races went similarly with Howard also occupying space in the back half of the men’s top 10 before moving forward in the rankings as the race went on. Grouse Gulch, the mile 58 aid station, seemed to serve as a hinge point between the first half of Howard’s race and its second half. There, he arrived in sixth place, but transitioned in and out of the aid station faster than a whole bunch of people, leaving in third. From there until after mile 72, Howard held that spot, though after that he was passed by Jeff Rome and was running in fourth place. After Thévenard’s disqualification, he moved up into and stayed in podium position until the finish. Another Hardrock paced hardrock solid from start to finish for Howard. Benjamin BucklinandJesse Haynestook fourth and fifth, respectively. Notable among the rest of the men’s field,Blake Woodearned his 22nd finish, andKirk Apttook home number 24.

Let’s tell it how it is: this race was theSabrina Stanley(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) show from start to finish. Stanley went immediately to the front of the women’s race, crossing Mineral Creek at mile 2 ahead of the other women. From here to about mile 28, Stanley ran just a couple minutes in front, such that the ladies caught sight of each other from time to time. Stanley said after that the race that catching sight of another woman behind her at the Chapman Gulch aid station, mile 18, encouraged her to put a strong effort on the climb out of the gulch. From Telluride, mile 28, to Ouray, mile 44, Stanley more than doubled her lead and arrived with an almost-half-hour gap. However, though she always remained handily in front of the women’s field, the gap between she and second place shrunk to 13 minutes again at Grouse Gulch, mile 58. But then the rest was really history, as at every location from which we reported from there to the finish, Stanley increased her gap on second place and her win was by 55 minutes. Immediately at the finish and resoundingly the day after too, Stanley stated she intended to use the entry into next year’s race that she earned by winning.

Photo: iRunFar/Ashley Saloga and Scout Phillips Steady as she goes,Nikki Kimball(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) took second place in her Hardrock debut, though she and third-placeDarla Askew(post-race interview) leap frogged each other a couple times as far as we observed, and who knows how many others, before their ultimate two-three finish. At mile 7, atop the first climb of the race, Askew and Kimball ran together, though Kimball would gap Askew on the long downhill to the KT aid station at mile 11.5. Nikki Kimball looking thrilled with second place at the 2018 Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks From that point until after Telluride, mile 28, Kimball ran a few minutes ahead of Askew. The pair flip-flopped again on the climb up after Telluride, with Askew arriving to the famous Kroger’s Canteen aid station, mile 33, up above 13,000 feet elevation, in second again. Askew maintained that second-place position until somewhere after Sherman aid station, mile 72. When we next saw the duo at Maggie Gulch aid station, mile 85, Kimball had put 14 minutes on Askew, and the pair would complete the journey back to the start/finish in Silverton in this order. Make that six finishes now for Askew! Darla Askew in a high moment at Grouse Gulch, mile 58.

"Hot Weather, Fast Times!: 2018 Western States 100 Results","On a hot-weather day on theWestern States 100course—where the midday heat registered 97 degrees Fahrenheit at the race’s 62-mile point and then 106 degrees at the mile-78 river crossing—winnersJim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) alighted fires of their own. Jim set a new men’s course record and Courtney finished in the second-fastest time ever by a woman. In the balance of this article, we’ll break down Jim’s and Courtney’s outstanding performances as well as what else happened at the front of the men’s and women’s fields. The iRunFar team was at the start, finish, and 16 spots along the 100-mile course! Read on for splits, quotes, early analysis, and more collated from the team’s observations.

It was 106F/42C or higher in the shade at the river crossing at 4 p.m. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It was a special day in the 2018 Western States 100 men’s race, with not only a stout men’s race overall, but also a new course record set byJim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Let’s look at both storylines individually. Jim Walmsley’s Western States 100 Course Record This was well and truly one for the record books. Jim Walmsley set a new Western States 100 course record of 14:30:04. It behooves us to equally well and truly break down how he did it. Let’s do this. In his pre-race interview, Jim said he was looking at a 15-hour race, meaning his plan was to run at a swift but not unheard-of-before-at-Western-States pace. At the finish line, he additionally added that his spilt sheet called for a 14:53 finish. Jim took the first 15 miles positively chill—and according to plan, it seems—arriving to Red Star Ridge (mile 15) four minutes over course-record pace. Almost 15 miles later at the Robinson Flat aid station (mile 30), he had picked up a little steam as he was two minutes under record pace. From there, though, the plan must have gone out the window as he positively let it rip. Jim Walmsley floating into Robinson Flat in the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Jim Walmsley floating into Robinson Flat in the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At Dusty Corners (mile 38), he ran through at a full 16 minutes under, gaining 14 minutes on record pace in 7.7 miles. Ahem. Did you get that? At Devil’s Thumb (mile 48), he was, again, 14 minutes under. Michigan Bluff (mile 56) 16 under. Foresthill (mile 62) 19 under. It went on like this until the Rucky Chucky river crossing (mile 78) when he passed through 26 minutes under record pace, what we believe was his maximal gap under record pace. The iRunFar team consistently reported that Jim spent minutes at a time in the aid stations. That is, anywhere from three-to-five-minute stays were regular for him. He’d sit, take off his shoes, get iced and watered down, and feed. Regular stays of this frequency in aid are more of a European thing than an American one, so it struck us as notable. Perhaps Jim is starting yet another American ultra trend? And perhaps hidden in this strategy was the rest time which enabled him to sustain such fast running paces when he was on the trail? Interesting, certainly, and worthy of future consideration. From the river crossing (mile 78), he began to give time back, but not so much that it ever seemed his record finish was in danger. Of course, because of his 2016 effort here, we all held our breaths when he went in the river and again when he was on his way to that crucial left turn. Jim said at the finish that he hung onto the rope whilst crossing the river and that there were two spectators awaiting him at that left turn. Just when we thought Jim’s passage was free and clear of obstacles, word came in that he was delayed by a mother black bear and her two cubs somewhere before the Pointed Rocks aid station (mile 94). Jim surprised the trio, the cubs treed themselves, and mama stayed nearby in protection. After a couple minutes, he was able to pass. Now, finally, it was just Jim and the last few miles of the Western States Trail. When he arrived to the finish in 14:30:04, he won by a massive margin and was 16 minutes and 40 seconds under the previous course record of 14:46:44. At the finish, Jim said that getting the record hurt and that “Tim [Olson, the previous record holder,] is a bad, bad man.” Mark it in the record books: Jim put together mind and body in near-perfect synergy to run his heart out and inspire a community of ultrarunners. I don’t know whose emotions were stronger at the finish (and perhaps around the ultrarunning world following online), Jim’s or everyone else’s. It’s a massive pleasure to see such a look of satisfaction on his face. Jim did it! Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Jim did it! Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The Rest of the Men’s Race After the race for the win and course record, there was still a boatload of men’s racing going on. Next, we point out the start-to-finish steady effort of France’sFrançois D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) for a distinct honorable mention. François went out at nearly the front of the men’s pack, running basically the whole race in one podium position or another, and settled into his ultimate second-place position before reaching the Robinson Flat aid station (mile 30). Over and over, our team reported that essentially François never looked amazing, but never looked poorly either. He just ticked off the miles until he arrived at the finish. He would say at the finish line that the runnable, hot, and dusty miles around the Dusty Corners aid station (mile 38) were his hardest. His 15:54:53, while quite far from winner Jim Walmsley, remains an excellent finish time that sits amongst the best second-place times in the history of this race. François D’haene is a machine. He once again got it done at the 100-mile distance this weekend. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell François D’haene is a machine. He once again got it done at the 100-mile distance this weekend. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Last year,Mark Hammond(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished third. This year, Mark Hammond finished third. Enough said. Just kidding, there’s a lot more to say! What is really the deal with Mark? Because he doesn’t look hot or sweaty or tired in the heat of the day while racing 100 miles, I’d like to have what he’s having. Mark put himself in the back of the men’s top 10 by Red Star Ridge (mile 6), ran some 35 more miles while gently ticking off places until he was in third when we saw him at Michigan Bluff (mile 56). Our field reporters from there out frequently and independently reported on how-strong-and-somehow-not-affected-by-the-heat Mark seemed. He’s nailed it with these two third places on the international 100-mile stage, though his 16:08:59 this year was about 45 minutes faster than last year’s finish in what will likely be called by the WS 100 weather pundits similarly difficult conditions. [Update, June 25:The punditry is now in and this year was the ninth-hottest year in race history.] It’s now two-straight third-place finishes at Western States for Mark Hammond. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It’s now two-straight third-place finishes at Western States for Mark Hammond. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It’s probably not fair to always compare guys likeIan SharmanandJeff Browning(pre-race interview) with each other. Yes, they employ similar race tactics but, yes, they are their own human beings with their own unique takes on how to enact their similar strategies. Even still, the pair finished four-five, respectively. My, oh my, was Ian in shape this year! You could see it early, as he was running further up in the men’s field earlier, and he looked peppy in body and confident in mind. When Ian crossed the finish line in fourth, he earned his ninth-straight top-10 men’s finish, and matched his previous best performance of fourth place in 16:20 in 2013… with a fourth place in 16:23. Mr. Consistent doesn’t even begin to precisely reflect Ian’s, ahem, precision. 2018 M7 becomes 2019 M4; see you next year! Don’t get into a walk off (or run off) with Ian Sharman.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Jeff Browning finishes Western States for the fourth time, this year taking fifth and following up on a fourth place last year and third the year before. That might sound like a descending trend on paper, but I don’t think it can be considered as such because, in actuality, a 16:45 run in this year’s weather seems like a step up on last year’s 17:32 in also-nasty conditions. At this juncture, Jeff Browning said he was going hunting… and that he did. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At this juncture, Jeff Browning said he was going hunting… and that he did.

Puke face or just a general 100-miles-is-a-long-way face, Cody held tough to finish seventh, a super-successful first-100-mile finish for him.Charlie Waretook eighth, looking comfortable and focused all day.Paul Giblin(post-race interview) took ninth for the second year in a row, giving himself a trio of top-10 finishes. AndKris Brown(pre-race interview) rounded out the ultimate top-10 position.

At the Escarpment (mile 3.5), the race’s high point, Lucy went over the top basically in the company of the top men. And at Duncan Canyon aid station (mile 24), she’d built an eight-minute lead over the other women. Over the course of the race’s first half, she established, held, and, then, lapsed a lead over the rest of the women’s field. She also hovered not so far from course-record pace before dropping below it and, then, finally slowing down compared to it. Lucy running into Robinson Flat in the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Lucy running into Robinson Flat in the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell As Lucy was easing off the gas, its seems thatCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was only getting warmed up. For fascinating comparison, as early as Duncan Canyon, Courtney was almost 18 minutes behind Lucy and not even in second place yet. The pass between this pair happened somewhere between the Devil’s Thumb and Michigan Bluff aid stations (miles 48 and 56). When our team saw Courtney at Foresthill (mile 62), it was clear that this race was now hers to lose. Courtney Dauwalter climbing to Michigan Bluff shortly after taking the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Courtney Dauwalter climbing to Michigan Bluff shortly after taking the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell More fun facts, at Foresthill, Courtney was 34 minutes off record pace. At the finish, she was about 40 minutes off record pace. Second-half closer anyone? When Courtney crossed the Auburn, California finish line in 17:27:00, hers became the second-fastest finish in race history, only bested byEllie Greenwood’s16:47:19 course record. The moniker ‘any distance, any surface’ fits Courtney perfectly, and she proved she can motor hard on the hot, dusty, flatter Western States Trail with not a trouble in the world. Kaytlyn Gerbin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who finished fourth last year by a conservative, move-up-late strategy, went out harder this year. Where she was in the teens place-wise last year, Kaytlyn was already in the middle of things and in seventh at the Robinson Flat aid station (mile 30). Seventh at mile 30 was Kaytlyn’s version of a conservative start this year, perhaps, as a woman on an elevated running plane from one year ago. She inched up bit by bit such that she was in fourth by Foresthill (mile 62) and then second by Pointed Rocks (mile 94), the position she held through the finish. It’s official—if for some reason it already wasn’t—Kaytlyn Gerbin has gone big time. Kaytlyn Gerbin improved on a great 2017 race in 2018.

This marks an outstanding 100-mile debut by an incredible young athlete already on the rise. Does it seem that the sky is the limit for Lucy, or is that just me? Lucy going lunar at the finish.

Like the other women who started meaning business off the line, Amanda was in the women’s top 10 for what we think must have been the whole race. Even in the day’s harshest and hottest conditions, Amanda passed us looking calm, speaking lucidly, and just in it. Amanda Basham added another WS 100 fourth place to her collection.

For the first 20 or so miles, Cecilia ran outside the women’s top 10, before climbing into it by Duncan Canyon (mile 24). The rest of the race seemed to involve her running steady, moving up not only through the overall field but also in the women’s field such that she crossed the line in fifth. With Cecilia’s finish, that makes two 100-mile debuts in the women’s top five. Cecilia Flori ran a consistent race to take fifth.

We’d be remiss not to mention that at age 60Diana Fitzpatrickran 23:52:56 to breakGunhild Swanson‘sprevious women’s 60-69 age-group record of 25:40:29 that she set at the age of 60 in 2005. To learn more about Diana,we profiled her(and her husband Tim) last year and wrote about herattempt at setting the 60-69 age group record here. What also has to be noted is the lack of DNFs amongst the front of both the men’s and women’s top contenders. While the race isn’t quite over at the time of this article’s publishing, it’s looking like the drop rate through the field will be on the low side of the average normal, but I’d have to guess that there were several fewer top-contender drops than in the recent half decade. [Update, June 25:299 of 369 people finished the race, which is an 81% finish rate.] Stephanie Violett is back in a Western States women’s top 10.

2018 Trail World Championships Results,"Spain’sLuis Alberto Hernandoand The Netherlands’sRagna Debatstook home individual gold medals at the 2018Trail World Championships, which began in Castellón de la Plana, Spain. The unique course featured net climbing, a real mix of runnable as well as steep and technical terrain, and a second half that was way more difficult than the first. Throw in some high humidity (though cool air temperatures) courtesy of the region’s Mediterreanean climate, and we have plentiful tough racing conditions at hand. In the men’s race, two-time defending champion Luis quietly shadowed the front of the field for the race’s first half, stayed there when men started slowing, and attacked on the tech-y and steep terrain with a little over 20 kilometers left to run. Ragna set the pace in the women’s race for most of the day, while other women tried but ultimately failed to match her effort. She broke clear of the rest of the field after the halfway point, running with smooth strength to her first Trail World Championships victory. In the team race, Team Spain–the home team–took home resounding, unchallenged gold in both the men’s and women’s races.

He patiently bides his time and watches the field, waits until his competitors begin to slow, hammers some section of the course, and becomes the Trail World Champion. Spain’sLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) did it again, pretty much the same way for a third year in a row. Not gonna’ lie, he put on a helluva’ entertaining show in doing so. This year, Luis ran within close contact of the lead through the halfway point, a little village called Atzeneta some 41 kilometers into the race. There, he passed through town in fourth position. Just 11km after that, he’d moved up to second and you could tell it was only a matter of time until he would take over the lead. By 65km in the race, Luis had a two-plus minute lead over the rest of the field and it only grew from there. Strong as ever, in winning the 2018 edition and at the age of 40, he becomes a three-time Trail World Champion. But we should back up a little, into the early race story. Though several men pushed the early race pace, the USA’sZach Miller(pre-race interview,post-race report) was perhaps pushing the most. Zach looked solid until suddenly he didn’t any longer. At 41km into the race, Zach sat about 30 seconds ahead of the rest of the men’s field. When we saw him 11km later, he was at the race’s helm by a full 3.5 minutes. Was he pushing the pace here? However, another 10km after that, Zach had climbed on the struggle bus, citing dehydration as his issue. He lost the lead after the 62km point, forging ahead as best as he could and ultimately finishing in eighth position. After the race, he said that his strategy was a gamble. Indeed, it was. El rey, Luis Alberto Hernando, on his way to his third-straight world championships win. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sCristofer Clemente(post-race interview) is a guy who at no time would I want behind me in a race. I seriously don’t know another runner out there who can strategically pace himself as well as Cristofer does. And, just like Luis’s repeat style, Cristofer was also back this year with his extreme late-race move-up strategy. Can we look at his placing at each of the aid stations? 72nd, 54th, 42nd, 27th, 13th, fifth, second, second, and second. Good grief! When I first saw Cristofer at 16.5km, he seemed further back in the field this year than last year. And looking at the stats, indeed this was true. At 9km into the 2017 race, he was in 31st. But then each time we saw him this year, he’d moved up through the field and looked completely comfortable in doing so. In the rocky, tough, steep terrain between the 52km and 62km villages-atop-mountains of Benefigos and Vistabella, where a lot of runners fell back, Cristofer advanced from 13th to fifth position. And just another 8km later, he moved into his ultimate second-place position. What a masterful performance. Cristofer Clemente once again was muy inteligente in working his way up to second at the Trail World Championships. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It was hard to get a read on just how good Great Britain’sTom Evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was without actually seeing him race. On paper, his steadily emergent performances over a short period of time looked stout, but where did his top-end potential lie? Turns out, this guy’s good in person, too. Ahead of the race, Tom said he came here to go big and that, while he hoped it would go well, he knew it might not. As such, I wasn’t surprised to see him put himself right near the lead from the get go. In fact, in the seven times we saw him during the race, we never saw him out of podium position. If Cristofer gets an award for being the best closer, then Tom gets another for his start-to-finish placing consistency. Did he ever have a bad spell where his pace lapsed? What’s left to really say about Tom’s breakout third place? There’s a boat load of talent here, and I gotta’ hope he’ll do something like a slower burn over the years to keep it sustainable, because I can see him going great places. Tom Evans continued his ascent in trail running by taking third. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Great Britain’sJon Albonhad this quiet demeanor about him on the course. He just put his head down, answered to no one, and ran his own race. Another easy starter, he didn’t actually come onto our radar in the race until about the halfway point when he had moved up into the top 10. But in the next 10km, he put the pedal to the metal and popped through Benefigos at 52km in fifth place. He’d move up one more position as Zach lapsed backward later in the race to finish fourth. Jonathan Albon helping Team GB to a silver medal. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell With his fifth-place finish here, France’sLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) has now finished fifth at the Trail World Championships three times. And the other time he was sixth place. Sheesh, take that one to Las Vegas. I’d put a bet on that. The USA’sMario Mendozawas right there all day. Last year, he finished as top American and just inside the top 10, and so it’s easy to imagine he was hungry for more. When things got hard in the last kilometers, Mario stayed strong, continuing to move up late to finish sixth place and, again, top American. Like Mario, France’sRomain Maillardwas there all day, too. For much of the race, we saw him working and running with his fellow French teammates. In the end, he finished seventh, putting a second French runner in to the top 10. Czechia’sJiří Čípaproved that this top-10 run at this race last year was no fluke by finishing ninth this year. Germany’sJanosch Kowalczykrounded out the men’s top 10. Just call him Predictable Pommeret. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Team Spain took this win with ease. With men finishing in first (Luis Alberto Hernando), second (Cristofer Clemente), and, then, 13th position viaPablo Villa, they were basically untouchable. Going into the race, it seemed like multiple men would have to foible for Team Great Britain to not take home a medal, but I admit to a little surprise with not only their silver, but with the strength of the team’s performance. After their third- and fourth-place finishers (Tom Evans and Jon Albon),Ryan Smith, a Great Britain citizen who lives in the USA, took 16th and sealed the deal on the silver team medal. Team France goes home with the bronze. Going into the race, they were a team favorite, but they just didn’t put it together on the day. In addition to their fifth- and seventh-place finishers (Ludovic Pommeret and Romain Maillard), their third team scorer wasAdrien Michaudin 19th. Don’t get between Mario Mendoza and the finish line late in the Trail World Championships. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. A very happy Tom Erik Halvorsen of Norway. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I’m just going to say it.Ragna Debats(post-race interview), of The Netherlands but who lives in Spain, made winning the Trail World Championships look easy. From start to finish, she just looked so smooth. When asked about this after the race, she said that all the hard work was done ahead of time and that all was left was to enjoy the race day. She also said that the pace felt easy for her. Hmn, imagine that!? Early on in the race, Ragna made her way to the front. By the time we first saw her at 16.5 kilometers into the race, she was leading. Though a couple women would come and go before and after that, she was always right there at the lead. Between the 41km and 52km aid stations, Ragna increased her gap on the field from a mere 20 seconds to almost two minutes. Let’s cut to the chase, though, her gains were just beginning. Her 16-minute win was a huge one in this deep field. Ragna was third at the 2016 Trail World Championships and fourth last year, and this marks a big step up for her again. Ragna Debats running with the focus of a Trail World Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sLaia Cañes(post-race interview) has been racing trail ultramarathons for several years, but her performances in the last year have been on another level. To elaborate, two years ago she was 19that the Trail World Championships, last year she was seventh, and now this, a second-place finish. I feel like her finish at the Trail World Champs last year was her notice to the world to really watch out. Laia was cheered for vibrantly all over the course, and that’s because she lives locally, which added another benefit for her. I think she knew the course well. Laia opened the race by running the first 40km in the second half of the women’s top 10 before moving into the front half of the top 10 in the race’s second part. Her strategy would not end there, though, as she continued to move up–all the way into second position. Her jubilance at the finish made it clear that she was more than elated with a second-place finish in this field. Laia Cañes is ecstatic after taking second in front of her home crowd. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sClaire Mougel(post-race interview) is admittedly a runner who I knew almost nothing about except for researching her ahead of this race. Much like Tom Evans’s international breakout on the men’s side, this race should serve notice that Claire can compete on an international level as well. Reportedly, coming into the race, she said she had no plan or goal, that she only aimed to go out and run her own race. Claire appeared inside the women’s top 10 for the first time at Useres, a small town located 31km into the race. The light switch turned on for Claire between 52km and 62km, however, and in this short distance but across mostly difficult terrain, she moved up from eighth to fourth place. One more position she would climb from there, up onto the women’s podium, which she would hold to the finish. Now that she has had this breakout, I’m excited to see where Claire, a national-level Nordic skier, takes her trail running. France’s Claire Mougel made herself known to the world with her performance. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sGemma Arenashad a strong start-to-finish performance in taking fourth. Given that her finish last year was off her capability and way back in 25th place and given that her run this year was a crucial lever in the Team Spain machine’s gold medal, Gemma has to feel good about this run. Gemma Arenas striding out on a smoother section of course. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Spain’sMaite Maiora(pre-race interview) might have summarized her performance best to us at the final aid station of Collao, 78km, when she said that she had given the race her absolute best. She started the race outside the women’s top 10, but gradually worked her self into it and up into her ultimate fifth-place position. Ever a competitor, Maite Maiora seems to be racing with more pleasure of late. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell While it was another Polish runner in the women’s top 10 for the first half of the race (that wasEdyta Lewandowskawho ultimately finished 15th),Magdalena Łaczakmoved up into the women’s top 10 in the second half to finish sixth, smiling each time we saw her. Women’s defending champion, France’sAdeline Roche(pre-race interview) had an injury-shortened training block prior to the race. She ended up in seventh place. The USA’sClare Gallagher(pre-race interview) had a roller-coaster race, running inside the top 10 early, falling back mid-race, and putting things back together to surge into the top 10 in the final 15km, in the end finishing eighth.Holly Pageled Team Great Britain with her ninth-place finish, whileKaytlyn Gerbinput a second member of Team USA into the top 10. Ain’t no one touching the Spanish this year. They robbed the bank of gold with the second-, fourth-, and fifth-place finishes of Laia Cañes,Gemma Arenas, and Maite Maiora. After several years of golds, Team France took away a silver medal this year via Claire Mougel finishing third, Adeline Roche taking seventh, andAmandine Ferratoending up in 14th position. Team USA, what a finish they had to earn their team bronze. The scoring team members were Clare Gallagher (eighth), Kaytlyn Gerbin (10th), andSabrina Little(12th).

2018 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results,"On a warm, sunny April day at the 2018Lake Sonoma 50 Mile,Jim Walmsley(post-race interview) andKeely Henninger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) went off the front from go, set their own paces, and in the process of winning, absolutely dominated their respective fields. In addition to the win, Jim took home a new course record, bettering his own 2016 course best by more than nine minutes. And Keely, though running for and ultimately missing the women’s course record, continues her 2018 winning streak and upward trajectory in trail ultrarunning. As the final race in the Altra Golden Ticket Series where entries can be earned into theWestern States 100, two men and two women took home Golden Tickets, too, and added some extra spice to the day’s events.

He already had a Western States entry and the Lake Sonoma course record before the race started, so you could say thatJim Walmsley(post-race interview) had nothing to lose by going out hard and giving it. This year, instead of hanging tight with the lead men for the first 10 miles or so like he did in 2016, Jim flew solo basically off the start. At each checkpoint from mile 12 through 38, Jim gained time incrementally on his course record, going as fast as 11 minutes under his own record pace at mile 38. Just time trialing against himself, really, in the heat of the day and perhaps a result of his hot early pace, he gave back a minute and some change on his record in the race’s final miles, still resetting his course best by nine-plus minutes to 5:51:16.

What was the M.O. in both the men’s and women’s races, the second-place finisher settled into their ultimate position early. In Jared’s case, by mile 12, he was squarely in second. Jared would say after the race that, like many, he felt good for three quarters of the race before suffering the final 12 miles or so. Suffer or not, Jared held steady through his second-place finish at the line. After the race, Jared said his primary objective was to earn a Golden Ticket and get back to Western States. Mission accomplished, Jared! Jared Hazen finishing second at the 2018 Lake Sonoma 50. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Mario Mendoza(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) really wanted to get on the podium at Lake Sonoma, and he earned his second third-place finish at Lake Sonoma, as he also did two years ago. Already bearing a Western States entry, Mario, too, had little to lose in going for it, and so he did. It wasn’t far into the race when Mario slid into third place and stayed there. While it seems that the front packs in trail ultrarunning these days are dynamic and changing from start to finish, this year the men’s and women’s Lake Sonoma podium settled out early and stuck, Mario included. He, like everyone, struggled a bit in the midday heat, and said post-race that the importance of heat training ahead of Western States in June was definitely underscored by this weekend’s sun.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Eric Senseman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) got a Golden Ticket to Western States, too! The dude’s excitement upon arriving to the finish line in fourth place and in Golden Ticket territory was thoroughly infectious. Before the race, Eric said he planned to temper himself early before racing in the second half–I think he said, “Don’t be surprised if I’m in eighth at half way.”–so I was a little nervous to see him running in fourth place as early as mile 12. In the end, there was no reason to worry as Eric held strong and put time on everyone in the field behind him in the race’s final 12 miles, crossing the line and earning his Golden Ticket. #seeyouinsquaw.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell ThoughKeely Henninger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said after the race that she didn’t intend to run off the front from the start, that’s how it worked out. What she called her comfortable, moderate pace quickly led her to the front of the women’s race. From start to finish, Keely ran in no-other-woman’s land, only sharing the trail with those in the men’s race. As early as mile 12, she timed in at about two minutes under course-record pace, where she’d basically remain each time we saw her until after mile 38. The heat and sun at midday chewed most people up, and Keely said she felt it and eased off the gas when the sun went full tilt. Though Keely was offered a Golden Ticket entry into Western States, she declined it to instead race the Lavaredo Ultra Trail in June in Italy. Keely Henninger winning the 2018 Lake Sonoma 50. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Taylor Nowlin(post-race interview), who fits smack dab in the up-and-comer category, ran herself into second place quite early in the race, a position, like Keely in first, she’d hold all the way until the finish. Taylor said after the race that the first 30 or so miles came easy for her, but that her nutrition suffered in the final miles and she struggled to maintain a good effort. She also said that she felt some pressure when she caught sight of third-place Camelia Mayfield on the short out and back at the final aid station, at mile 45.5. She must have had plenty of gas in the tank, though, holding her own to the finish. After the race, Taylor said she was undecided on whether she’d accept her Golden Ticket, as she’s also considering the Lavaredo Ultra Trail in Italy. OnSundayTuesday after the race, the Western States race organization said that Tayloraccepteddeclined her Golden Ticket. Taylor Nowlin climbing her way to second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Camelia Mayfield(post-race interview) earned a Golden Ticket, too, on account of her third-place finish here. Another up-and-comer, Camelia checked into the mile 12 aid station in fourth place, but found her way into her ultimate finishing position before the race’s halfway point. As others slowed late race, Camelia crept up to second-place Taylor Nowlin around mile 45.5, coming within about one minute of her. Both maintained pace from there, however, going two-three across the finish line a minute apart. Camelia, we’ll #seeyouinsquaw, too. Camelia Mayfield in third at mile 30.

2018 Tarawera Ultramarathon Results," In rainy but warm weather and with difficult course conditions, AmericansKelly Wolf(post-race interview) andDylan Bowman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) each used their speed early and strength later to dominate the women’s and men’s fields and win the 2018Tarawera Ultramarathonon New Zealand’s North Island. After nine years of traveling in a generally west-to-east direction between the towns of Rotorua and Kawerau on New Zealand’s North Island, the Tarawera Ultramarathon made a u-turn and switched directions for 2018. This course change brought the fast-and-fast terrain in the race’s first half and the more hilly and technical terrain second. Many multi-time Tarawera runners said this new direction, which is net uphill, is the much harder way to travel. Additionally, a moisture-laden tropical storm made landfall about 24 hours ahead of the race, dropping loads of moisture both the day before the race and on race day. Mud, slippery rocks and roots, and flooded trails made the technical second half of the race even more so. It seems that the result of these conditions was that it was the jack/jill-of-all-trades runners–those with good leg speed and excellent strength–who saw the most success. Keep reading for all the details! Dylan Bowman and Kelly Wolf, 2018 Tarawera Ultramarathon champions.

Thanks for helping make iRunFar happen! -Bryon Powell, Editor-in-Chief In the women’s race, AmericanKelly Wolf, (post-race interview), a first-time Tarawera runner,and two-time Tarawera championRuby Muir(pre-race interview) took the women’s race out fast, the pair leading the field through the 10.5-kilometer aid station in 42 minutes. (For the record, I believe that aid station was actually at about the 9.4k mark.) The pair was essentially together again at 26k, but then Kelly was all alone when we saw her roll through the 41k aid station at Tarawera Outlet, where she’d just put away those kilometers at roughly 3:25 marathon pace. For next 61k, it was the Kelly Wolf show, as she ran unchallenged by the rest of the women’s field, crossing the finish line in a mix of emotions. After a couple of years of building experience and success at trail and ultrarunning, Kelly put it all together to nail her first international-level win. Kelly Wolf 26 kilometers into Tarawera, and on her way to the win. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Early in the race, AmericanAmanda Basham(post-race interview) settled into third position, shadowing leaders Kelly and Ruby through the first two aid stations, just a short distance back. However, before the 41k aid station, she moved into second position and held it all the way to the finish line. The first thing she said upon finishing was, “I’m so happy to be done!” This was a familiar expression among runners, with the difficult weather and course conditions making an already challenging event more difficult. Amandasaid before the race that 2017 had been a difficult year for her personally, in many respects, and that she was looking to put it behind her and have a strong 2018. Well, it’s early February and things are looking pretty well for her already. Amanda Basham taking second at the 2018 Tarawera. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Some runners run focused and quiet. Other runners take themselves to deep, dark places to get the job done. AustralianErika Lori(post-race interview) seems to run happy. She bore a wide grin every time we saw her, despite rolling through pouring rain and through trails with sole–and soul–sucking water and mud. By the first aid station, Erika was in fourth position and she, too, would continue to run strong all day, moving up one spot to take third place. Erika Lori happy with third place.

ItalianCecilia Flori(pre-race interview), who lives in New Zealand and who took third last year, did not start the race due to illness. Full results. The men’s race went out hot, as expected. To be honest, I about died when the men rolled through the 10.5k aid station in 37 minutes. Sure, flat forestry roads basically connected the start line to this location, but that’s just obscene for a trail 100k. It turns out that opening aid station was actually about 9.4k into the race according to runners’GPS watchespost-race. At that first aid station, AmericanCody Reed(post-race interview) led out the field and was shortly followed by AustralianVlad Shatrov, AmericanDylan Bowman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), and New ZealanderSam McCutcheon(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). The next time we saw the men at 26k, the trio of Cody, Vlad, and Dylan had shook loose of Sam by about a minute. This trio would travel roughly together–with a slight accordion-style progression–until somewhere after the 50k mark when Vlad was the next to lapse behind the lead. At the Lake Okataina aid station at 58k, Dylan was all alone in the lead with Cody a minute behind. Some 22k later at Blue Lake, Dylan was up by a full 16 minutes, saying after the race that he pushed the climb right after 58k in an attempt to gap the field. In addition to pushing that climb, it seems that Dylan continued to navigate the difficult course conditions with a strength the other runners couldn’t match. It wasn’t entirely smooth sailing to the finish, as Dylan also navigated his own rough patch in the final 20k, giving back just under a half a minute per kilometer on Cody behind him between 81k and 97k. However, he pulled through that spell, moved swiftly over the final 5k, and crossed the line to win the Tarawera Ultramarathon for the second time (2015 post-race interview). Dylan Bowman, 2018 Tarawera Ultramarathon champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Once Cody found his way to second-place position after the race’s halfway point, he held it and held off his competitors until the finish. Like Dylan, though, he said after the race that it wasn’t smooth sailing and that he was unsure about whether he would finish at times. At 58k, Cody held an 11-minute gap over third place, and at 81k, that gap had shrunk to just three minutes. He looked okay, but I wondered if he was okay enough. He said that, during this section, he was forced to walk a lot and he hit his head hard and had to sit down for a minute or two before continuing on. After the 81k aid station at Blue Lake, however, Cody caught another wind and ran strong to the finish line, with a commanding second-place finish. Cody Reed finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks To race directorTim Dayat the finish line, Sam said that this reversed course direction “…is way harder, mate!” However, there’s something about Sam that makes hard things look easy. At the 58k aid station, Sam was in fourth place, but he emerged at 81k in third and only three minutes out of second, a man on a mission. Though he wouldn’t be able to bridge the gap to second place, he moved smoothly during the race’s finally hilly kilometers to claim the third spot on the podium for the second year running.

She ran in second position as early as about eight kilometers into the race, and I don’t believe she ever deviated from that position.

Fu-Zhao started the race out easily, running in sixth place when we saw her first at 12k. By 36k into the race, Fu-Zhao had moved up into her ultimate third-place position. From there, the gap between her and the women behind her only increased as she maintained her speed and strength even during the course’s hardest terrain.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks From New Zealand originally, Hong Kong transplantMarie McNaughton(pre-race interview) represented the ‘home team’ well in taking fourth. Though she was ill earlier in the week and thought she might not even be able to start the race, Marie worked the race course steadily to finish for the fourth time–in her fastest time. Not bad for being under the weather! After a couple years of competing in shorter ultra-distance races, fifth-placeHong-Fen Zhang, of China, moved up in distance with this strong performance. England’sSarah Morwoodpracticed perfect pacing, running outside the top 10 early and moving up later into sixth place. China’sYan-Xing Maran as high as third place before slowing later to finish seventh. Iceland’sElisabet Margeirsdottirand the USA’sNicole Kalogeropoulosboth ran in the back half of the women’s top 10 for most of the race.Stephanie Roland, who is from Namibia but who lives in Hong Kong, pushed late to occupy the final top-10 spot. Andrea Huser(pre-race interview) did not finish the race, citing fatigue from running 100 miles last month and jet lag. Full results. Well, I’ll remember this race for quite some time… but not necessarily for all the right reasons. I was told ahead of the race to be prepared to be surprised by the speed and strength of Chinese runners who I’d never heard of, and this was precisely how this race went down. At 12k into the race, the first five runners were Chinese and I’d never seen any of them race before. Within this lead pack, which ran into the 12k aid station more than six minutes ahead of course-record pace already, three of the five men would ‘stick it’ and finish at the front of the race. China’s Min Qi on his way to winning the 2018 Vibram Hong Kong 100k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks At the 28k point,Min Qi(post-race interview) emerged as the leader but withJing Liangright behind him, only a few seconds back. The pair, both of China, ran close together and flip-flopping the lead until beyond the 52k aid station, where Liang broke from Qi and gained at least seven minutes of space. When we saw the pair next at about 76k, both runners looked tired but were still moving well. The gap between them reduced, however, to the point that Liang and Qi would finish within one second of each other at the finish line, with Liang breaking the tape. All was not well in this competition, however, as rumors (and social media) had been circulating for hours that a hiker was accusing Liang of cheating, and had presented evidence of it to the race directors. This all came to a head when, a minute or two before the pair finished, Vibram Hong Kong 100k race directorSteve Brammarmade an announcement at the finish line that, while race leader Liang was about to finish, his result was likely to not count due to inappropriate behavior. Brammar also said that the race organization would hear him out after finishing before making their ultimate decision, however. China’s Jing Liang running in the lead at 28k, before his disqualification. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks There was no usual celebration at the finish, as the two runners, it seemed, were already aware of what was happening. Much was lost in translation to me here, as the runners were speaking in Chinese and a lot of what they said wasn’t translated into English. Eventually they disappeared, and the media was informed that after the runners had time to recover, the race organization would speak with Liang. About 75 minutes later, news was circulated around the finish line that Liang’s disqualification was now official. The race made a statement on their website a few minutes later that said: “Runner Liang Jing (bib #34) crossed the finish line in 9:28:35 and in first position, but has been disqualified for receiving support outside the checkpoints, which is not permitted by the race rules. Liang Jing explained that he asked for water from a hiker and understood that he had permission to swap his empty bottle with her full one, as he pushed himself to the limits.  He expressed regret at this misunderstanding, apologised for his behaviour, and stated that there would never be a repeat.” To be clear, the race’s rules state that support outside of aid stations isn’t permitted except in cases of emergency or if a runner purchases supplies from a hawker, restaurant, vending machine, or the like on the course. The rules also state that penalties and disqualifications may be applied at the organization’s discretion and are final. This made Min Qi the race champion. His finish time of 9:28:36 brokeFrançois D’haene’s2016 course record of 9:32:26. [Editor’ Note:We spoke with race director Steve Brammaron Mondayand he confirmed some facts. He indicated that at the 36k point of the race, a hiker lodged a complaint with the race’s other RD Janet Ng, saying that the runner wearing bib #34 ran up to her and asked for water, took a water bottle from her without permission, and then left a bottle behind. After consideration, the RDs decided to allow the runner to finish, hear his side of the story, and, then, make a decision. The RDs also warned Jing Liang a short distance from the finish that they were addressing this incident. After Liang’s arrival and after some recovery time, the RDs spoke with Liang and he recalled the story similarly except that he thought the hiker was offering him water and that there must have been a miscommunication. Liang was ultimately disqualified because he confirmed that he took aid outside of support points in a way disallowed by the rules. The RDs indicated that Liang clearly felt badly for what had happened and said that he wouldn’t do it again.] That’s the end of my objective reporting on this incident, and here are a few words of authorial subjectivity, which I offer in light of this incident and several recent confirmed cheating reports in trail running and ultrarunning. Sports are essentially a game, and games have rules. In our sport of trail ultrarunning, the rules vary from race to race, but are put in place to attempt to level the game to a match of mind and body. It’s the responsibility of every ‘player’ to know the rules before they start the game, and to abide by them from start to finish. I applaud the race organization for its decision to act on an incident which not only was incongruent with the rules, but gave Liang an advantage over the rest of the runners. Tough action and reaction in circumstances like this aren’t easy, but upholding a high ethic so as to maintain the values of our sport is crucial. I hope all the sport’s participants choose this path going forward, as well. Let’s talk about the rest of the race. The USA’sAlex Nichols(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was somewhere around 20th place at 12k into the race–not a disconcerting number of men in such a competitive race as Alex usually let’s the gunners fire things out. The disconcerting number, however, was that he was seven minutes back of the lead already. He would say after the race that he thought he was already running pretty fast at this point, and indeed he was. Twentieth place was just temporary, however, as another 10k later he was already in 10th. It went on like this, Alex picking off fast starters and those runners who excel less in technical terrain, until a little over 80k into the race where he’d moved into third place. Alex would also say after the race that, though he suffered a lull in the middle of the race, he was able to recover it and close strong. He crossed the finish as the third runner home, but was shortly upgraded to second place. American Alex Nichols looking happy with second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks China’sYun-Hui Yuwas fun to watch race. He whooped and hollered with joy several times when we saw him, quite obviously enjoying himself. Yun-Hui went out hard, running with or near to the lead pack for the first 20k or so. After that, he’d lapse back, playing chase for the rest of the race. Last year, he finished 13th in 10:53, and this year his effort of running some 49 minutes faster earned him the third spot on the podium. Yun-Hui Yu, of China, hooting with joy. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The best way to describe the performance of Nepal’sPurna Tamangis to say that he stuck it. He started out the race running in sixth place some 12k in, and finished in fourth place when it was all over. Though a few men came and went, moving ahead or lapsing behind him, he stayed steady–and smiling–all day. A member of the winning men’s Oxfam Trailwalker Hong Kong team for the last two years, he’s now found solo success on Hong Kong’s trails with fourth place here. BothHarry Jones, from Wales but living in Thailand, andJohn Ellis, an Australian who lives in Hong Kong, paced themselves expertly, running strong from start to finish and picking off carnage along the way. Ellis is a finisher of each of the race’s eight editions, but this is his fastest. With his 10:35 finish, he improves his HK100 PR by some 55 minutes. Jones and Ellis went fifth and sixth. Nepal’sSuman Kulungtook seventh place in a strong start-to-finish effort. Hong Kong’sHo-Chung Wongran across the finish line as applause and cheers roared through the crowd, he a clear hometown favorite.Brian McFlynn, an Irish runner living in Hong Kong, moved up in the second half of the race to finish ninth.Justin Andrews, an American living in China, also ran smart to take 10th. Full results. Thank you so much to Andre Blumberg, Paper Pongsubkarun, and Koichi Iwasa for their assistance in covering the race!

2018 Western States 100 Lottery Results (Plus Auto-Entrants),"The lottery for the 2018Western States 100took place today, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. However, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. A total of 4,909 runners entered the lottery for the 2018 race. This is up from 4,248 runners entered in the lottery for the 2017 edition, 3,510 applicants for the 2016 race, and 2,566 for the 2015 edition. A total of 15,074 tickets went into the drawing for next year. This is also up significantly from 11,021 tickets in the 2017 lottery. The starters list in June 2018 will ultimately contain 369 runners, a number decided by the race’s permit through the Granite Chief Wilderness. Among this there will be 105automatic entrants(some decided and some yet to be decided, see below for details), three that were drawn from those who were in the live audience for the lottery itself, and 261 runners who were chosen in today’s lottery. A change was announced to the WS 100 entrance process in 2016, and will be implemented for the second time in the 2018 event, a 50-person General Waitlist. If a registered entrant decides not to race, members of the waitlist will move onto the entrants list. Today, that waitlist was also filled from among the lottery entrants as well. For perspective, in last year’s use of the waitlist, it went 39 deep in offering waitlist members spots in the race. The WS 100 website has anup-to-date list of the 2018 Western States 100 entrantsand should soon have one for waitlisted runners. Let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into WS 100 so far. The women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2018 as automatic entries, and it appears that eight of the 10 women have chosen to do so: The men’s top 10 from 2017are also invitedto return with auto-entries, and it seems that seven of them intend to do so: According to UltraSignup, 74 of the 101 auto-entry slots were filled ahead of the race, with 15 of those being top-10 returnees from last year. Below are some speedy women and men who have already achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methodsso far. Here they are and how they obtained their entry: Women Men A total of 261 names were drawn during today’s lottery, and among them were a small number of speedy and notable athletes. Men Women Some folks will get into next year’s Western States off the order 50-person General Waitlist. Here are the speedsters on that list: Top runners still have two routes by which they can gain automatic entry into the 2018 WS 100. Golden Ticket Races The five-race 2018Altra Golden Ticket Raceswill offer up to 20 WS 100 entries to be given to top finishers of these races. This is a decrease from 24 entries from last year, and is because the series will have one less race in it. Due to a massive wildfire on and around its course last year, the Gorge Waterfalls 100k will not take place in 2018. The race administration announced earlier this year that the four spots that won’t be used from the series at Gorge Waterfalls would be given out by the Ultra-Trail World Tour to North American runners. S0, basically, the top-two men and top-two women finishers of each race gain entry, and if they already have an entry or if they decline it, the entry can roll down as far as fifth place. Here’s the race-series schedule for 2018, [updated May 27] with each race’s four WS100 entrants: Ultra-Trail World Tour For 2017, 10 slots are given to top international and North American contenders via the WS 100’s participation in theUltra-Trail World Tour. We believe that four of these 10 slots have been announced with six more to be determined at a later date. All UTWT entrants are noted above in theAutomatic Entry section. Last updated June 4, 2018.

2018 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2018Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run! This article breaks down the results of today’s lottery for the run’s 2018 edition. Let’s start with some statistics and background information. This year’s lottery entrants list was up to 2,236 applicants. For perspective, the 2017 lottery had 1,966 entrants, the 2016 lottery 1,549 entrants, and the 2015 lottery 1,367 applicants. These 2,236 entrants were represented by 12,357 total tickets, which went into today’s lottery buckets. For perspective, last year’s total ticket pool was 8,490 tickets. Prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants into one of three divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with Hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. The divisions are Veterans, runners who’ve finished Hardrock five or more times; Nevers, who are runners who’ve never finished Hardrock; and Everyone Else (or, more simply, “Else” below), runners who’ve started the event and finished between one and four times. For the 2018 lottery, there were 43 Veteran applicants who had 422 tickets, 1,975 Never applicants with 11,127 tickets, and 218 Else applicants with 808 tickets. Looking back at last year’s lottery, there were 43 Veteran applicants who had 404 tickets, 1,722 Never applicants with 7,339 tickets, and 201 Else applicants with 747 tickets. The 2018 event will start 145 runners. Today, the event organization selected 33 Veterans, 45 Nevers, and 67 Elses. Of the 145 entrants chosen, up to five were chosen ahead of time by the race by Run DirectorDale Garland, which were announced publicly among the names chosen in the lottery. In addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into three separate division-specific waitlists. For perspective, in 2017, 10 people got off the Veteran waitlist and into the race (which was everyone on the Veteran waitlist),9 people from the Never waitlist, and 6 people from the Else waitlist. For the 2016 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrant spots 4 deep in the Veteran division, 4 deep in the Never division, and 7 deep in the Else division. For the 2015 edition, the waitlist went to 9 deep for the Veterans (which included all of the Veterans on the waitlist that year), 9 deep for Never, and 12 deep for Else. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end continues to grow in competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which Hardrock prides itself upon. Below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2018 contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in. Let’s start with the men’s competition.Kilian Jornetwon last year’s race–with a dislocated shoulder–and he’s elected to use his automatic entry.Mike FooteandXavier Thévenardare the two runners with certain entry who are more most likely to challenge Kilian, whilePau Capellwho sits second on the Never waitlist could spice up the front of the field when he almost certainly gets in. The2017 women’s champion,Caroline Chaverot, had the option of automatic entry, but declined to return for 2018.However, Switzerland’sAndrea Husergot in and that means trouble for everyone else in the women’s field.Kaori Niwaof Japan, who finished fourth at UTMB in 2017, is Huser’s strongest challenger. IfNikki Kimballcan return to her form of old, she’ll certainly be up front, while perennial podium contenderDarla Askewwill again be in the mix.Big movement atop of the waitlists could greatly enhance the depth of the women’s fields with 2015 and 2016 champAnna Frostninth on the Else waitlist; 2013, 2014, and 2015 champDarcy Piceuninth on the Veteran waitlist;Bethany Lewis, who finished third in 2016, eighth on the Else waitlist; and2017 Western States 100 third place and Hardrock newcomerSabrina Stanleyis now in the race after starting as fifth Never waitlist. Below is the full list of who waschosen in the lottery, andon the various waitlists. Let’s get on with the lists of top competitors who are in, who may be, and who is definitely not. You can seethe full entrants list hereor look back at the lottery play-by-play on theHardrock 100 Twitter feed. There is only one way to gain auto entry into Hardrock, and that is by winning the prior year’s race.Kilian Jornethas chosen to use his entry to go for his fifth-straight win. Below are the notable men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Here are the women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Here are the front-end men’s contenders who were chosen in the top-10 slots of the Veteran waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Never waitlist, or the top-20 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These men have some shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. Here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-10 slots of the Veteran waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Never waitlist, or the top-20 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These women have some shot of running. Here are some fast men who are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. (Waitlist placements will not be updated unless entry becomes a real possibility.)

2017 The North Face 50 Mile Championships Results,"An emblematic fall day–with bright sunshine yet cool air and a light breeze–greeted runners at the 2017The North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Mile Championshipsin the San Francisco Bay Area of California. For this year, the course was reformatted, and though it contained many of the same trails and aid stations throughout the southern Marin Headlands, a new starting line in Marin City and a new finish line at Crissy Field in San Francisco over the Golden Gate Bridge meant an overall new feel. After sharing the lead with other men in the race’s first half,Tim Freriks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) used the second half to break free from the rest of the competition and run unimpeded to a big win. While it may have been another woman who set the early pace in the women’s race,Ida Nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) marked her with no issue before assuming the lead in the race’s second half. Though her challengers were just a minute or a few back at times, Ida was stronger than them all and emerged as champion for a second year in a row. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Be sure to check back.

With your help, we’re looking forward to a great 2018. Thank you! -Bryon Powell, Editor-in-Chief of iRunFar When the race fired off from its 5 a.m. start in Marin City and we all peered up the paved, immediately steep road,Zach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) led everyone out at a pace others would later describe as cross-country race pace. True Zach form. By the top of that first climb at 2.5 miles in, Zach had settled back into the lead group. From there until Stinson Beach, mile 28–and though there were other interlopers who came and went from in, around, and even in front of the group at times–a lead trio ofTim Freriks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), Zach, andHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ran within earshot and eyesight of each other. After the race, Hayden said that while Zach descended the fastest, he and Tim climbed a bit better than Zach, and, thus, their accordion played on. Tim Freriks is a happy man at the finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell For more than the race’s first half,Matt Daniels, a fast runner at shorter distances on the track, road, and trail debuting at 50 miles, ran in the front half of the men’s top 10, eventually settling into fourth place by mile 18. Incredibly, a tight pack holding the rest of the men’s top 10 ran together for almost 30 miles. At mile 27, fifth through 10th–Paddy O’Leary(pre-race interview),Blake Hose,Tòfol Castanyer,Max King(pre-race interview), andTyler Sigl–ran right together and just five minutes off the lead. At the finish, Paddy remarked about this phenomenon, saying that he didn’t run alone once until mile 40. The chase pack of (right to left) Paddy O’Leary, Blake Hose, Tòfol Castanyer, Max King, and Tyler Sigl in Stinson Beach. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell After mile 27, Tim put his foot on the gas and accelerated on the stout climb up the Dipsea Trail from Stinson Beach. When we next saw Tim at Muir Beach 2, mile 39, Tim had a little over five minutes on Zach, running that section almost 30 seconds per mile faster than him–and he looked calm and smooth in doing so. In the next nine miles, he added another eight-plus minutes to his lead. When we saw him on the Golden Gate Bridge two miles from the finish, he was just under 14 minutes ahead. Call it a glory lap from there with no pressure from behind, Tim crossed the Crissy Field finish line as 2017 champion. In the race’s final miles, Zach and Hayden ran a few minutes apart from each other, both running well with no challenges from behind, but suffering through their own kinds of pain. Zach said he caught a glimpse of Hayden a few minutes back when they were on the Golden Gate Bridge and it caused him to close as hard as he could. The pair, who went one-two last year, went two-three this year, separated by about five minutes when all was said and done. Zach Miller points to the champion, Tim Freriks, at the finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Kris Brown, who’s he? Turns out, a pretty fast SoCal runner who just broke out onto the national scene with his fourth-place come-from-behind race strategy. Kris didn’t appear in the men’s top 10 until mile 39, where he was ninth. The guy hammered, though, moving up to sixth by mile 42, and then fourth by mile 48, a position he held until the finish. On Thursday in his pre-race interview with us, Paddy correctly predicted his fifth-place finish. In short, he remembered back to having finished 13th at this race two years ago and ninth last year, saying that means he should finish fifth this year and win next year. Ahem, you better start training, Irishman. Hayden Hawks crosses the line third with his baby. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The back half of the men’s top 10 was full of interesting and unique men. All-mountain-sportsmanNick Elson, a Canadian, proved he has leg speed, too, in taking sixth. Aussie Blake, who was well into the international trail-ultra scene a couple years ago before taking a break, returned to take seventh. Eighth was do-everything-man Max. Ninth was Spaniard Tòfol, and 10th was Tyler. Early pace pusher Matt Daniels would DNF. Mountain-running phenomTayte Pollmannfinished his first 50 miler, though things ended a bit rough after a fast start with the leaders. Full results. Well, she said she’d probably take the pace out hot. Ahead of the race, pro road runnerRenee Metivier(pre-race interview) said that, though it would be a good idea to start slow in not only her first 50 miler but also her first ultramarathon, she’d probably still go out fast. Indeed, she did. The first four times we saw the women, from mile 2.5 through mile 27 at Stinson Beach, Renee was pacesetting andIda Nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) marked her. After the race, Ida explained that Renee started really fast but that she likes going fast, too, so she keyed off Renee’s pace for quite a long distance. Turns out, that long distance was past the race’s halfway point. Through mile 27, they were still almost shoulder to shoulder. After that, Ida said she felt strong on the climb from Stinson Beach and that she really likes the wooded section in the headlands above there, so she moved well. Renee Metivier (left) leading Ida Nilsson at Stinson Beach (mile 27). Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Out of the forest and back down to Muir Beach at mile 39, Ida led with Renee nowhere in sight. There, Ida would be faced with a new pressure, though, that ofClare Gallagher(post-race interview) just one-and-a-half minutes off the lead. Clare, who’d been running in the third to fifth-ish positions for the first half of the race, was making herself known in running for the win now. But Ida was the stronger woman on the day because a couple miles later, when they passed through Tennessee Valley for the second time at mile 42, she’d increased her lead to just under four minutes. From there, the pair ran almost the same speed to the finish line, where Ida would cross as champion for the second year in a row, and where Clare would take second, improving upon her fifth last year. Clare Gallagher being herself at mile 28. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Third-placeMegan Kimmel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said after the race that, at 10 or 12 miles in, she wasn’t sure if she would finish. Her calf muscles have long been her TNF 50 nemesis, and she said she was feeling them early. Turns out, her calf muscles hung in there just fine and so did her strategy–what she described after the race as her budding “ultra strategy”–of starting easier so that she could run strong later. I did think it was a little unusual where, in the first half of the race, Megan was running several minutes and positions back from the lead, but it all made sense when, starting a mile 39, Megan had moved up into third place, a position she’d maintain to the finish. Megan Kimmel after another solid run at the TNF 50. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Local runnerMegan Rochehad a helluva’ debut at the 50-mile distance with her fourth-place finish. Early on, she seemed patient and calm, hovering at or just outside the top five. Later in the race, she moved up to fourth place and looked incredibly focused upon keeping that spot. A breakout runner on the day wasBrittany Peterson, who also ran strong inside the women’s top 10 for most of the day to finish fifth. In the balance of the women’s top 10, Renee held on after her super-fast start to finish her first ultra in sixth place,Abby Mitchellran steady all day for seventh,Stephanie Violett(pre-race interview) finished smiling in eighth,Kelly Wolfran well in another long ultra for ninth, andAmy Leedhammoved up into the women’s top 10 late for the 10th position.

2017 Les Templiers Results,"On a relatively cool Sunday with occasional rain showers and partly cloudy skies in the Grands Causses of southern France, New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and France’sSébastien Spehler(post-race interview)ran fast and strategic races to emerge as champions among competitive women’s and men’s fields at the 2017Grand Trail des Templiers. Les Templiers is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) race boasting 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) of climb with a goodly amount of it on more technical and steep singletrack in the race’s second half, following a more runnable first half.

Thank you! -Bryon Powell, Editor-in-Chief of iRunFar The USA’sCamille Herronseems to know one speed, and that’s fast. It was, thus, no surprise that she led the women’s race at 9 kilometers.Ida Nilsson(pre-race interview) andEmelie Forsberg(pre-race interview), Swedes who live in Norway, were strung out two-three behind Camille, both trailing less than 30 seconds back. At 26k, the next point in which we saw the field, Ida had moved up front with Emelie still a half minute off the lead, now in second. New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Sweden’sMimmi Kotka–yes, another Swede!–were making statements now, running together in third place. Here, too, we had our first glimpse of Canada’sAnne-Marie Maddenwho was right in the mix, running in fifth. Five women, a third of the way through the race, all within a minute: yep, things were shaping up. Emelie Forsberg running before dawn at the 2017 Les Templiers. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Between there and the 35k point, Ruth moved up to join Ida in the lead. Both looked strong as they cruised through the aid station. In third and fourth, within 90 seconds of the lead and a couple seconds of each other, were Anne-Marie and Emelie. It was starting to look like a race of four, as these women were building a gap over the rest of the women’s field. Ida Nilsson and Ruth Croft leading together at 35k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The 48k point was another turning point, as Ruth was alone in first with a minute lead on second-place Ida. Five more minutes until we’d see another woman, this pair was also gapping the rest of the women’s field. It seemed clear that, barring something strange, the race for the win was now a race of two. At 65.5k, amidst the technical and at times steep singletrack that characterize parts of the race’s second half, Ruth recorded a nearly 11-minute lead on her closest chaser, but trouble brewed. She thought she’d get her personal nutrition at this water-only aid station, but crewing wasn’t permitted. Resultingly, she’d suffer and slow in the final 10k–a challenging 10k at that. Second-place Ida was still moving well and moving up on Ruth fast, decreasing Ruth’s 11-minute lead to 4.5 minutes at the finish line. Not enough real estate for Ida to catch up and plenty enough for Ruth to retain her lead, the duo put to rest their duel and went one-two in this dynamic women’s race.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell As for Anne-Marie and Emelie, Emelie moved ahead of Anne-Marie before the 48k point, and then gently created a gap to finish third, with Anne-Marie in fourth. Mimmi held tough for a fifth-place finish. Camille would not finish the race, dropping at 48k. Reigning IAU Trail World Champion, France’sAdeline Roche, was an early drop–she entered the race with a bit of injury, gave it a shot, and ducked out after the first checkpoint.

Nine kilometers into the men’s race of any competitive trail ultramarathon in Europe is like being 9k into a road marathon. The pace is hot and everyone is there. Les Templiers 2017 would be no different. Sweden’sAndré Jonssonled the massive pack of dudes. No joke, when we checked the numbers after the race, it was 30 men within two minutes of the lead. At the second aid station, 26k, the men had given each other some breathing room. Here, nine men ran within two minutes of the lead. This time, Finland’sHenri Ansioled the charge with André, France’sSébastien Spehler(post-race interview), Switzerland’sMarc Lauenstein, and France’sNico Martin(pre-race interview) in hot pursuit. Some expected top runners, like Sweden’sElov Olsson, the USA’sAlex Nichols(pre-race interview), and Norway’sStian Angermund-Vik(pre-race interview) occupied positions in the 20th- to 30th-place range, but they all looked okay. When we saw the men next, a leader had emerged. Sébastien led the charge at 35k, which is approaching the halfway point distance-wise but not even close to the midpoint in time–there’s a lot of racing left still–with no other man in sight. After a full minute, it was a rush of France countrymates Nico,Sylvain Court, andRomain Maillardtogether in second through fourth. Nicolas Martin (right), Sylvain Court (left), and Romain Maillard (obscured) at 35k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The rest of the top-10 men came through before the five-minute mark, and this group included Marc in fifth, André and Henri working together in sixth and seventh, Morocco’sRachid El Morabityin eighth, France’sAdrien Michaudin ninth, and Spain’sJessed Hernandezin 10th. We next saw the men at 48k, and it was clear that Sébastien was seriously making a go of it, now with a four-minute lead. Trailing him was Nico, looking well, too. Romain and Marc ran in third and fourth. Surprise, surprise, who was now amongst the top-10 men? Grab your popcorn, after being in 18th place at 35k, Alex had moved up to ninth and was 11.5 minutes back. He looked well enough that we expected him to keep doing what Alex does best, running the second half of races faster than most of his peers. The only question was, how far could he move up? Alex Nichols at 48k and on his way to third place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At 65.5k, with just a little over 10k to go, the game seemed almost over because Sébastien looked really strong and his gap over second place was now 6.5 minutes. The beauty of ultrarunning, though, is that anything can and does happen, so it’s only over when it’s over. In second was Nico, still there, still strong, and holding his own 6.5-minute lead over third place. In the end, the Frenchmen would cross the line one-two, with Sébastien the men’s champion.

But Alex was now in fourth, a minute out of podium position, and on the definitive hunt. While we waited at the finish, word from the final aid station at 69k was that Marc was holding onto third but barely, with Alex a couple seconds back. From there to the finish, Alex hammered home to third place and Marc arrived in fourth. Fun fact, Alex was just under 11 minutes back at the finish, about the same deficit he had to winner Sébastien some 28k prior. With a mix of men running close together in the race’s final third, Henri came out on top to finish fifth. Notable DNFs included both Sylvain and Rachid who bowed out late in the race after running inside the top 10 for a while.

2017 CCC Results,"Among world-class fields, AmericansClare Gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) each brought home big wins at the 2017CCC, the 101-kilometer race that’s part of the week-long UTMB festival. Because of a storm, the race organization made a last-minute CCC course change to the final section between Vallorcine and La Flégère, which normally travels via a high and appropriately named pass called Tête aux Vents, to take a lower and unexposed path. This course change is thought to have sped the race up by a bit. On Friday morning, September 1, the CCC shot off from downtown Courmayeur, Italy, to make its half loop around Mont Blanc to the Chamonix, France finish line. Blue skies and clouds greeted runners through the Italian part of the race, while rain and, eventually for the mid- and back-of-the-packers, snowy mix closed in on the course on the French side. In the end 1,742 entrants made it to the finish, while 414 people did not.

Thank you! -Bryon Powell, Editor-in-Chief of iRunFar Spain’sMaite Maiorashot off the CCC start line and took out the first, super-steep climb hard. The USA’sClare Gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) played chase, saying after the race that Maite’s exceptional pace couldn’t–or perhaps shouldn’t–be matched so early on. Through about the race’s halfway point, Maite led and Clare stalked in the vicinity of two to four minutes back in second place. Clare Gallagher, 2017 CCC champion. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein By the time the pair reached Champex-Lac, Switzerland, after halfway, Clare had overtaken the lead and it was Maite’s turn to lurk closely behind. Though Maite had given up the lead spot, she wasn’t going to go down easily. At Vallorcine, 83k, just before the final climb and descent, Clare held only a three-minute lead. Clare must have absolutely hammered that last climb, though, because at the top of it, at La Flégère, she now had a 13-minute lead. Clare maintained that lead through the finish line to become the 2017 CCC champion, with Maite as the runner-up. Maite Maiora finishing second at CCC 2017. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Spain’sLaia Caneshad a strong race, occupying third position for most of it, but the USA’sKeely Henningerkept the pressure on all the way to the finish, running just a couple minutes behind Laia for much of the race. In the end, just four minutes separated the pair as they went third and fourth. Laia Canes taking third at CCC 2017. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Three Americans in the top five, holy smokes! It wasKelly Wolfwho helped make the USA the highest-performing country in the CCC top 10 as she finished fifth. One of the pre-race favorites, France’sNathalie Mauclair(pre-race interview), dropped at Champex-Lac, just over the race’s halfway point. Spain’sEva Moredacalled it quits in the same location. The USA’sCassie Scallondidn’t make it either, dropping at the base of the final climb. Full results. Though he was sharing the lead when iRunFar first saw him at Refuge Bonatti, 22k into the race, the USA’sHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said he was way back from the lead on the pavement run to get out of Courmayeur and for entire first climb. He explained that he chilled in the initial sprint, and then when things leveled out a little on the high ridge above Val Ferret in Italy, his running speed led him to overtake those in front of him such that, at 22k, it was he andLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) ahead of a long train of dudes. Hayden Hawks, 2017 CCC champion. Photo: iRunFar/Hayden Hawks This pair ran close together, working together but still competing with each other, for the next 20k or so. On the section between the villages of La Fouly and Champex-Lac in Switzerland, between the 42k and 56k marks, Hayden said after the race that this is where he made a concerted effort to push and shake Ludovic, and his effort worked. From there to the finish, Hayden only increase his lead over all of the rest of the men until arriving to Chamonix as the 2017 CCC champion. Marcin Świerc, of Poland, ran the first third of the race in the back half of the men’s top 10, then pressed up into the top five by halfway. It was on the big climb after Champex-Lac, past 56k, where he overtook the remaining runner between him and second place, former race co-leader Ludovic. Marcin and Ludovic would ultimately finish second and third. Marcin Swierc happy in second place at CCC 2017.

Morocco’sRachid El Morabitytook things out hard, running within the top three for the race’s first half before slowing down to 22nd place. South Africa’sRyan Sandeshad an off-par day, too, lapsing as far back to the high 30s placing midway before clawing back to 21st place. Ludovic Pommeret earns the third podium spot of CCC 2017.

2017 UTMB Results,"After taking second twice, Spain’sNúria Picasnailed it this time for the women’s win. In the men’s race, it was now-three-time champion, France’sFrançois D’haene,who emerged at the front of the huge field of top male competitors. In doing so, both became 2017UTMBchampions. The entire field of runners encountered difficult weather conditions at times with rain, snow, and wind. A volatile weather forecast led the UTMB race organization to make two last-minute modifications to the normal course. They removed the technical and steep up-then-down Pyramids Calcaires in Italy, which was a new addition to the course in 2016, as well as the normal route between Vallorcine and La Flégère near the end of the race, which normally travels via a high and appropriately named pass called Tête aux Vents, to take a lower and unexposed path. The resulting 2017 modified route was a couple kilometers shorter–quoted at 166.9 kilometers by the race organization–and with a bit less climb and descent. On Friday evening, September 1, the race fired off west from its Chamonix, France starting line to travel a counterclockwise loop around Mont Blanc while traveling through France, Italy, Switzerland, and back to the same square in downtown Chamonix. The race saw 1,685 finishers and 852 DNFs.

If any of us wasn’t sure of said statement ahead of this race, surely we all were convinced as we watched François become champion of this best-ever-assembled group of men in a trail ultramarathon. And let’s be real here, he didn’t just win, he dominated. From start to finish, it was François who was right there, either setting the pace or matching whomever else was doing so. François D’haene looking confident and relaxed before the start. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell François shared the race’s first marathon with several different men–but all of the expected ones–includingKilian Jornet(post-race interview),Jim Walmsley(post-race interview), andXavier Thévenard(pre-race interview). Eventually, Xavier lost contact off the back of this group while climbing to Col du Bonhomme at a little over 40k into the race and just after dark on Friday night. From there, it was the remaining trio who ran closely together to the 90k mark at Refuge Bonatti, which lies high on a ridge above Val Ferret in Italy. This trio traveled accordion-style, spreading out by a minute or so at times, depending on the terrain and time spent in aid stations. However, at 90k, Kilian began to lag behind, arriving there four minutes behind François. And by another 20k after that, in the village of La Fouly, Switzerland at dawn on Saturday morning, Jim, too, said good-bye to the lead. While Jim arrived to La Fouly close to François, he was tired and needed recuperative time before hitting the trail again. Jim Walmsey, Xavier Thévenard, and Kilian Jornet together in the Les Contamines aid station. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell For the race’s final 55 kilometers, François slowly but surely created space between him and the rest of the men’s field. And, I need to say, his efforts brought what felt like the entire Euro trail community out onto the race course to cheer for him–in an energetic but also, at times, too-frenetic way. Case in point, they created a 30-minute, dead-stop traffic jam in Vallorcine, which is 149k into the race, when about five of them simply left their cars in the driving lanes to watch François run by on the trail next to the road. No joke. Back in Chamonix, on the 1.5k glory run through town to the finish line, François ran through a sea of humans filling the route, wanting a glimpse of him or a slap of his hand. A huge smile upon his face, his arms lifting now and then to clap and fist pump, François swam that sea and crossed the line as 2017 UTMB champion. François D’haene runs into La Fouly at dawn on Saturday morning. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Since 2009, I’ve been watching Spain’s Kilian Jornet run and race. Since 2009, I’ve watched him find relative ease in racing trail ultramarathons and dominating men’s fields within them. And, since 2009, it’s been exactly twice that I’ve seen Kilian worked over by these types of races, the first when the heat got the best of him at the 2010Western States 100and the second this weekend when the fast pace slowly but surely wore him down. Kilian would say after the race that he loved the first half of the race and suffered the second, but if there’s anyone who can suffer better than Kilian, I would like to meet him or her. Kilian Jornet running into Saint-Gervais. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The first glimpse we had that François might be the better racer on the day between he and Kilian was at the 64k mark above Lac Combal when we watched François slow to wait for Kilian after a downhill section. But it was another 26k later at Refuge Bonatti where the fatigue of the day had accumulated enough and Kilian arrived some four minutes after François. At pretty much each checkpoint after that, Kilian dropped back a little more. However, in total fairness, he looked happy, was running well, and still looked like the Kilian we’ve grown to expect. That is, until the final checkpoint at La Flégère, about 7k from the finish. Kilian was well and truly whooped there! In the end, Kilian is still Kilian, a downhill running legend, and we watched him hammer some of that last long downhill back into Chamonix to take second, 15 minutes off the lead. Kilian is an enormous fan favorite, and fans filling the finish line roared as he ran the final straightway and across the line. It’s two for two for AmericanTim Tollefson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)! Tim proved that his 2016 third-place finish was definitely no fluke by doing it all again. At the first spot iRunFar’s reporters were stationed, above the village of Saint-Gervais a little past 20k into the race at sunset Friday night, Tim looked calm around 15th place. Another 20k later at Col du Bonhomme, in the snow, wind, and below-freezing temperatures offered there, he’d cracked top 10 and was looking unbothered by the weather. Another 25k after that, at above Lac Combal in Italy, and he’d moved up to seventh position and looked like his race was just starting. To paraphrase Jim Walmsley after the race, Tim hit the Italy-Switzerland border at 100k and flew. Moving into third place at Champex-Lac, Switzerland, 123k, he would run unchallenged by anyone behind him to the finish line. The dude knows how to celebrate at the UTMB finish. Huge smile, high fiving the crowds, high-knees running up and down the chute–his party, his way. Tim Tollefson striding into La Fouly. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein France’s Xavier Thévenard (pre-race interview)knows how to execute. Ahead of the race, he said that his goal was to run 21 hours, no matter what the men’s field was doing around him. Last-minute, weather-induced course changes shortened the route by an estimated hour’s worth of running for the lead men and, what do we have here, but a 20-hour finish for Xavier? He ran the first 35k or so in contact with the lead runners, but let them go on the long climb to Col du Bonhomme, the race’s marathon mark on a high pass in France, to do his own thing. Several times going into different checkpoints, we saw Xavier checking his watch and checking in on his race plan. At the finish line, he said that the weather conditions were hard at times, as his hands got so cold that it was hard to eat. That said, I think his finish time matched his goal, and he sat at the finish with what looked like a content, yet fatigued smile in fourth place. The USA’s Jim Walmsley and his 100-mile racing is just so entertaining. The dude is inordinately talented, fit, and driven. But what he and his 100-mile racing is so far confirming is that 100 miles on mountainous trails requires a significant mental component–it’s not just physicality anymore. If Jim can figure out the psychology and strategy of racing 100 mountain miles, watch out world. That said, Jim’s fifth place should not be discounted: the only guys to beat him collectively have eight UTMB wins, a second, two thirds, and a fourth–and nothing else in their combined 12 runs at UTMB. For about 100k, Jim ran at or near the front of the race, with François and Kilian. It was clearly a struggle for him to stay with these guys at times, though, to run the pace of two very experienced mountain ultramarathoners and not run ahead. At 110k in La Fouly, Switzerland, Jim arrived close to the lead, but tired, underfed, and with blistered feet. He took significant breaks in La Fouly and another 13k later in Champex-Lac to address his various issues. These breaks and a general slowdown lapsed him back to seventh position. His energy and competitive drive eventually returned, though, and he clawed back a couple positions to finish fifth. After the race, Jim said he’d learned a lot and was already eager to race UTMB again. Jim Walmsley walking his way out of La Fouly before going on to finish fifth. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Spain’sPau Capellhad a great race, backing up loads of stellar results in 2016 and early 2017 with a sixth-place finish here. He created some fun finish-line drama by hunting Jim just 100 meters back or so and forcing Jim into run sub-six-minute-mile pace through the streets of Chamonix to hold onto fifth place. The USA’sDylan Bowmannailed it for seventh place in his first UTMB finish. In speaking with him after the race, it’s clear he’ll go home happy but hungry for more. Lithuania’sGediminas Grinius(pre-race interview), who finished second last year, battled an old injury to eighth place this year.Zach Millerdid not have his best day but he still managed to runinto the top 10 with ninth place, helping put four Americans in the top 10, more than any other country. Tenth place, Spain’sJordi Gamito, might just have been one of the happiest guys in the field. He seemingly wore a smile all day, night, and day. Jordi Gamito running into La Fouly. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Last year’s fourth place, AmericanDavid Laney(pre-race interview) ultimately took 14th. Pre-race favoritesJason SchlarbandSage Canaday, both Americans, had off-par days but each made it to the finish in the 26-hour range. Some notable withdrawals,Tòfol CanstanyerandMiguel Heras, both of Spain, good friends, and who spent much of the race running together just outside the men’s top 10, would both DNF, with Miguel making it as far as Trient, Switzerland, just 25k from the finish line, before stopping. That all said, I think the drop rate among the highest-echelon men was overall quite low. Full results. The top-six men at UTMB 2017 (left-to-right): 5. Jim Walmsley, 2. Kilian Jornet, 1.

New fans of trail ultrarunning might not know her name as she’s been on a physical and mental break from international racing for the last year and a half or so, but in her heyday of 2013 to 2015, she was close to unbeatable. And, now, she’s back. Núria set the pace of the women’s race pretty much all night, all day, and into the night again. For some 130 kilometers, she looked like the Núria we know: calm and quiet in outward psychology, lightfooted and efficient in physical state, and damn fast. With the exception of the first 20 kilometers where she shared the trail with several different women, no one amongst this year’s competition could ultimately keep her pace. In the race’s final 30 or so kilometers, Núria suffered some breathing problems which made running almost impossible. She was thusly forced to walk much of the final downhill into Chamonix and the roads through town. When she crossed the line and became the 2017 UTMB champion, her face was a mix of emotion: happy, shocked, and, well, tired, too. In speaking with her after the race, it’s clear that Núria’s competitive fire has returned. Núria Picas winning UTMB 2017. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Switzerland’sAndrea Huser(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) is really something else. At just over 20k into the race, above the village of Saint-Gervais at about dark on Friday night, Andrea told us, “I’m tired.” And she didn’t look her springy self either. She was running in the women’s top 10 there, but it looked like it was taking significant effort to do so. But, little by little, as the night went on, Andrea said after the race that she began to feel better. Her position relative to the rest of the women reflected this, too. In the earliest hours of Saturday morning, as the distance and bad weather began taking its toll on the field, Andrea kept moving up. By 90k, she was in third place and in second just 10k later. Andrea’s competitive story wasn’t over there, though. Because Andrea was moving well and Núria was walking much of the final seven kilometers, Andrea crept very close to the winning position. In the end, less than three minutes separated them, an incredibly small spread after 166 kilometers of racing. Andrea Huser just enjoying some watermelon in La Fouly. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sChristelle Bard(post-race interview) had a huge breakout race to round out the women’s podium. Her performance wasn’t unprecedented, though, as she’s had two strong finishes at the UTMB festival of events in taking third at last year’s TDS and fourth in the 2015 CCC. Christelle started the race conservatively, saying after the race that the race’s fast starting pace put her pretty far back in the field. By about the race’s halfway point, however, she’d moved inside the top 10. At 90k in, at Refuge Bonatti high on a ridgeline in Italy, Christelle was seventh. Just 10k later at Grand Col Ferret, the pass where runners leave Italy and drop down into Switzerland, she’d moved up to fourth. And by Champex-Lac a little over 20k after that, she was in podium position, where she would finish. It was a smooth and even-keel effort that got the job done for Christelle.

As objective as I try to be with my reporting, there’s everything to just love about this woman. She’s got a perma-smile. There’s no hype or pomp to accompany her running. She simply runs and smiles and kicks the pants off competitive women’s fields like this one with her steady, speedy, relentless progress. Eighth place at last year’s UTMB and fourth at this years, what is Kaori’s potential here? By the way, Kaori also finished fourth at UTMB wearing a cast and nursing a broken arm from a fall at the Tromsø Skyrace a month ago. Ahem, extra toughness points there.

She made a latest-of-race kicks to propel herself into that final fifth spot. After a couple rough gos at big races so far this year, Canada’sAlissa St Laurent(post-race interview) was due a good race, and I think she got it in finishing sixth.

You know, Caroline always looks like she’s working hard–we’ve heard her breathing like it’s 10k race some 100 kilometers into these sorts of races. So when we saw her putting a lot of effort into things, we thought it was standard procedure for her. Turns out, Caroline wasn’t feeling well and it got the best of her after the 90k aid station at Refuge Bonatti in Italy. At the next aid station, Arnouvaz, she dropped from the race, citing physical problems. Caroline’s raced a lot this year, including very recently theHardrock 100. It seems maybe like some recovery is in order for her. Caroline Chaverot while running the top three into Les Contamines. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Several other top women also didn’t make it to the finish line. France’sJuliette Blanchet, last year’s fourth-place woman, stopped at Lac Combal, 65k. After running among the top women early,Emelie Lecomte, of France, dropped in Courmayeur, Italy, making it two UTMB DNFs in a row for her. And Brazil’sFernanda Maciel(pre-race interview) DNFed at Arnouvaz, 95k. To end this on a happy note, while there are hundreds of lovely mid- and back-of-the-pack stories, one we love is the UTMB march that the USA’sAmanda Basham,Magda Boulet, andKaci Lickteigmade with each other. While Kaci hadn’t planned to ‘race’ race UTMB due to a lack of training while caring for an ill family member this summer, Amanda and Magda tried and it wasn’t either of their days. This trio teamed up, worked together, and crossed the line hand in hand. Also,Stephanie Violett(pre-race interview) battled a tough day to finish about 40 minutes ahead of her American compatriots.

2017 Hardrock 100 Results,"The 2017Hardrock 100was run in challenging conditions, which included a severe storm for most of the field on the first day, an injurious fall for SpaniardKilian Jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), and a brief interlude of getting lost by France’sCaroline Chaverot(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). No matter, these two rose from those challenges to win via their own commanding, but very different performances. In the men’s race,Mike Foote(pre-race interview) took second for the third time, andJoe Grantrounded out the podium after a couple recent rough goes at Hardrock. In the women’s race,Darcy Piceu(pre-race interview) landed her fourth second place and her seventh finish in first or second here, and France’sNathalie Mauclair(pre-race interview) overcame the challenges of living at sea level to round out the women’s podium and finish her first Hardrock. In the end, 126 runners among the 145 starters completed the tough mountain circuit made up of more than 33,000 feet of climbing starting and ending in Silverton, Colorado. The final few runners reached the finish line during the last hour of the race–between 5 and 6 a.m. Sunday morning–before the 48-hour cutoff. The final 2017 run finisher wasRobert Andrulis, who in crossing the line completed his 10th Hardrock. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back.

Photo: iRunFar/Mike Place If there is such a thing as Hardrock lovingKilian Jornet(pre-race interview), then there might also be such a thing as Jornet loving Hardrock. The now-four-time champ, who is arguably the world’s best mountain athlete, could undertake pretty much any race or expedition he wants, anywhere in the world, anytime, and yet he returned for his fourth outing around the 100.5-mile Silverton-and-back-to-Silverton loop through the remote San Juan Mountains of Colorado. That’s gotta’ say something about an event. Like in previous years, Jornet went out with whatever runners set the pace. In this case, it wasCaroline Chaverotat the very start andIker Karrera(pre-race interview) soon after. Jornet and Karrera would work together and run near to each other until Ouray, at mile 57. Kilian Jornet descending into Grouse Gulch, mile 42, with his injured arm tucked inside his jacket. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Around mile 14, as Jornet dropped through a steep snow patch off Buffalo Boy Ridge and into Maggie Gulch, he took a head-over-heels–actually a couple times, as he recalled post-race–tumble. In an interview with us after the race, he said he was looking around instead of at where he was putting his feet, punched through the snow and into rocks, and rolled. This dislocated his left shoulder and opened a couple small flesh wounds. Jornet explained that he has a problem with dislocating that shoulder after several previous similar injuries in skiing and climbing, and he also said that he then used his other arm to re-locate his humorous bone where it should be inside his shoulder joint. Yep, on the mountain, with some 85 miles yet to run. His pain eventually began to bother him, especially on downhills due to the jostling and bouncing involved in downhill running. At Grouse Gulch, mile 42, he asked for it to be taped immobile against this body, the way he’d then carry his arm for 58 more miles. A significant shoulder injury was still no match for Jornet. After sharing the relative lead with several runners until the KT aid station at mile 89, Jornet easily accelerated on the long, final climb, gapped everyone else in the field, and finished some 22 minutes ahead of any other man. His 24:32 is his slowest of his four Hardrock finishes, perhaps a reflection of how an injured arm slowed him down at least a little bit. Early pace setter and lead sharer Karrera ran in or near to the lead for the race’s first 57 miles. He looked calm and collected, and especially able on the steep, off-trail, and little-trailed downhills which frequent the course. However, he would become beset by stomach issues that required him to hole up in the town of Ouray, mile 57, for almost 90 minutes. Eventually, they would abate enough that he would be able to forge ahead, though several positions back and at a slower pace. Leaving Ouray, he exited as fifth man. He would mostly run in this position until about a mile from the finish where he was overtaken to finish in sixth place. Iker Karrera in Maggie Gulch, at mile 15. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Mike Foote(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) knows how to run Hardrock. Patient, even-keeled, and chill-but-focused seems to be his winning psychological recipe in addition to wicked physical fitness. All day long, it seemed, Foote ran in contact with the lead. The guy was just always right there. A couple cases in point, at Maggie Gulch (mile 15), Engineer aid station (mile 49), and at Ouray (mile 57), he remained just five minutes off the lead. At the mountain town of Telluride in the western San Juans, mile 73, Foote left the aid station in the lead, but withJoe Grant(post-race interview) and the always looming Jornet right there. From mile 73 to mile 89, Foote kept in close contact with eventual winner Jornet. Though Foote was no match for Jornet in the final 11 miles, the rest of the field was no match for him and he finished some 43 minutes ahead of everyone else. Three times a second-place finisher for Foote, in 2009, 2015, and this year. Mike Foote looking happy in Maggie Gulch. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Similar to Mike Foote but a bit more loosely, Grant ran in comfortable contact with the lead from the start to very near to the finish. Let’s take a look at the same aid stations we examined with Foote: at Maggie Gulch (mile 15) he was eight minutes back, at Engineer aid station (mile 49) he was 17 minutes back, and at Ouray (mile 57) he was full-on sharing the race lead with Jornet. After Ouray and up until Chapman Gulch at mile 82, Grant remained in very close contact with the lead. He said after the race that he suffered the final climbs especially, though he remained capable on the downhills. He would roll over the finish line in third place. Joe Grant running at 12,000 feet in Maggie Gulch. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Wyoming’sGabe Joyesis a strong regional runner with solid credentials at tough ultras in the Rocky Mountain West, though he remained untested among a more competitive stage like this one. Very early in the race, Joyes placed himself among the top-10 men. For example, at mile 15 in Maggie Gulch, he was in seventh place. Throughout the race, he’d ride the waves of positions in the middle part of the top 10, while generally trending downward in position. His fourth place and sub-27-hour finish seal the deal on his street cred for playing with the big guns of mountain ultrarunning. Nick Couryplayed the race super smart, moving up from well outside the men’s top 10 in the race’s first third, to sixth position with a mile to go. There, he accelerated past then-fifth-place Karrera to finish in the fifth position and for his fourth Hardrock finish. Notable among the men’s field, co-defending championJason Schlarb(pre-race interview) dropped in Cunningham Gulch, just nine miles into the race, following a couple days of gastrointestinal illness. Both Coury brothers finished inside the top 10, withJamil Couryearning eighth place among the men.Scott Jaimefinished, earning his 10th Hardrock completion in 11 tries at the event.Blake Woodearned his 21st finish, and Kirk Apt took home number 23.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks I’ve never seen someone race quite likeCaroline Chaverot(pre-race interview) does, with such singular focus, at such incredible intensity, and for such a lengthy period of time–in this case, 28.5 hours. She led the women’s race from start to finish. Let’s be clear, she took the men’s race out hot, too. A half mile into the race, Chaverot full on led the entire field and as far as Maggie Gulch, mile 15, she ran at men’s—not women’s—course-record pace. By the next time we saw Caroline, in the former mining outpost of Sherman at mile 29, she’d notably slowed from her previous efforts of keeping nearly with the men’s leaders, but was still running well under women’s record pace. In fact, at Sherman, she was 12 minutes up on the women’s course record. She increased that time between there and Governor’s Basin, mile 64.5, what amounted to the race’s middle third, where she was 34 minutes ahead of women’s course-record pace and perhaps most meaningfully, only 23 minutes behind the lead men! Let your mind wrap around what it means to have a woman running just 23 minutes back of a guy called Kilian Jornet some 65 miles into a race. Unreal effort on Chaverot’s part. Caroline Chaverot descending into Grouse Gulch in the rain. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks What happened next was something for the storybooks. First, she had a noticeable slowdown episode climbing the three miles from Governor’s Basin to Kroger’s Canteen, arriving to the latter just 19 minutes ahead of record pace and now 29 minutes behind the lead men. By all accounts, the slog up to Kroger’s was messy and slow this year due to rotten snow—everyone’s splits recorded slow ascents here—but Caroline ascended these three miles slower than the peers with whom she’d shared the trail this day so far. Then, about a mile after Kroger’s Canteen, where the route climbs out of the head of Marshall Basin and into the head of Liberty Bell Basin via the Mendota Saddle—a small pass—Caroline missed the saddle and descended about 1,200 vertical feet into Marshall Basin before apparently noticing her mistake and retracing her footsteps back to the saddle and onto the course. All in all, it appears she was off course for a little over an hour, but it also appears that the episode disturbed her psychology for the balance of the race. She was visibly angry at the next aid station of Telluride and clearly somewhat disappointed with herself as late as the finish. Caroline would close the final third of Hardrock strongly. In the 27 miles from Telluride back to Silverton, she would not approach her previous pace as the men ahead of her increased their gap on her and her pace was now slower than women’s record pace, but she also remained untouchable by the rest of the women’s field. Her best competition in the race’s final third was from second-placeDarcy Piceu(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). In Telluride, Piceu rolled through 66 minutes off the lead. At the finish, she was 51 minutes back. Though Piceu cut into Chaverot’s lead by 15 minutes in 27 miles, Chaverot was too far in front and still moving too well to be caught. As a result of her dominating performance and despite her off-course time, Chaverot won the 2017 edition of the race in the third-fastest time in its storied history. Darcy Piceu on her way to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Simultaneous to Chaverot’s off-the-front efforts, a strong competition betweenHannah Green,Anna Frost(pre-race interview), Piceu, andNathalie Mauclair(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ensued for more than half the race. As late as Ouray at mile 57, this foursome was split by only 31 minutes—a miniscule amount of time in a race such as Hardrock. On the long and enduring 4,000-plus-foot climb out of Ouray up to the mile 67.5 high point of Kroger’s Canteen, Green began to struggle and lose contact with the group while Piceu moved into the group’s leadership position, breaking off the front of it and gaining a 20-minute lead over the rest of the women. This is a position that Piceu would not only hold steady in during the race’s final third, but also increase her place in. That is, when she crossed the finish line back in Silverton in second place, her closest chaser was 72 minutes back. Of note is that Piceu also was among the few Hardrock runners to race without a pacer the whole time. With her second-place finish, she brought her lifetime Hardrock statistics up to three wins and four second-place finishes. Anna Frost enjoying the wildflower magic of Maggie Gulch. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks France’s Mauclair says that her race was limited by the altitude, and that she had to move more slowly than she would have liked. Early on, such as when we saw Mauclair at Maggie Gulch (mile 15), Sherman (mile 29), Grouse Gulch (mile 42), and Ouray (mile 57), she ran in the fifth position, but she was in clear contact with and a part of the pack of second-through-fifth-place women. Between Ouray and Telluride, mile 73, Mauclair ticked up a position from fifth to fourth place. Then, she arrived into Telluride in fourth while then-third-place Frost was there, and left in third place. The back-and-forth effort between Mauclair and Frost continued, with Frost overtaking Mauclair atop the climb after Telluride, Oscar’s Pass, before Mauclair overtook Frost and arrived to the mile-82 Chapman Gulch aid station with a four-minute lead over Frost. From there, Mauclair would hold and then increase her lead over Frost to finish in third place. What she described at the finish line as a long battle which involved perhaps just the right amount of suffering, two-time defending champion Frost emerged as this year’s fourth-place finisher. Becky Batesrounded out the top-five women. Green, who early on influenced the women’s race and who eventually took a long rest before continuing on, finished in seventh place.

2017 Lavaredo Ultra Trail Results,"TheLavaredo Ultra Trail(119 kilometers and 5,850 meters of climb) took place this weekend at Cortina d’Ampezzo in northern Italy. Caroline Chaverotof France claimed her second victory at Lavaredo in a winning time of 14:05 and 12th overall. Chaverot now has the two fastest times including the course record of 13:40 that she set in 2015. Fabien Antolinosof France claimed his first major victory with a stunning win in a fast time of 12:32 and only 17 minutes off the course record. He raced within himself for the first half and used that as a foundation to move strongly through the field to finish for the win. The Dolomites. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell After a stormy preceding night, the conditions happened to be perfectly cool and dry enough for the 11 p.m. start in the centre of Cortina for the 11th edition of the Lavaredo Ultra Trail. As the runners amassed, the music blared out and the atmosphere became euphoric as the seconds ticked by, getting ever closer to the start time. It’s always a fast start at Lavaredo and this year was no exception, CatalanPau Capelland a strong race favorite with his impressive streak of performances was leading it out and working together with New Zealand’sScott Hawkeras they reached Ospitale at the 18-kilometer mark. They had already created a one-minute lead on the chasing pack that included Norway’sDidrik Hermansenand AmericanSeth Swanson. The women’s race had already set its stage, New Zealand’sRuth CroftandCaroline Chaverotcame in to the Ospitale aid station within seconds of each other. They had already stretched the gap on Poland’sEwa Majerand ItalianLisa Borzanito seven minutes, such was this opening frenetic pace. Ruth Croft running toward second place at the 2017 Lavaredo Ultra Trail. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell The race proceeds through the forested trails with a short climb to Son Forca and into Federavecchia followed by a much bigger climb to Refugio Auronzo at 48k. Still with the lead came a strong Capell but now on his own as Hawker was having stomach problems and would drop much later. Swanson topped out the climb to the refugio looking deadly and in the hunt and ready to close that 10-minute gap. Hermansen and LithuanianGediminas Griniuswere showing their experience and had moved up to third and fourth. Race winner Antolinos was clearly in good shape as he arrived less than one minute later and only 17 minutes off the lead. Chaverot arrived at the refugio in 5:22 elapsed with Croft three minutes later and very much looking to stay in touch and perhaps hustle Chaverot out of first place. As it happened for both the women’s and men’s races, the strategic advantage was to significantly change at around 67k at Cimabanche. After the tough climb to Auronzo, there is a long downhill stretch and a relatively flat section in and out of Cimabanche followed by a much shorter climb and a lovely descent to 75k and Malga Ra Stua. It was at Cimabanche that two significant things happened. Croft had been charging and was literally steps behind Chaverot at Cimabanche but that was to be the closest she would get to Chaverot who would step up the pace. Antolinos was in fifth and some 31 minutes behind leader Capell who was working hard to create a gap on Swanson. From Cimabanche to Malga Ra Stua and eventually to Col Gallina at 95k after a steep climb, Antolinos had made up those 31 minutes and was now in the lead. A superb section of running, but he did have a problem, a strong Swanson was hot on his heels and looking to close that gap. Seth Swanson looking strong for second place. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell It was at Col Gallina that Capell, who arrived in third, would drop with dehydration issues. This put Italian favoriteFulvio Dapitin third ahead of Hermansen. But it was not this Norwegian that he had to fear, it was another one,Erik-Sebastian Krogvig, who had been running in seventh or eighth most of the way. By Passo Giau at 104k, Krogvig was hot on the heels of Dapit. By the time Chaverot had reached Col Gallina, she had put 25 minutes on Croft and it was only to stretch out more as the remaining kilometers passed by. After losing the lead to Swanson briefly over the remaining climb, Fabien Antolinos had managed to fight back to regain his lead. He came into Cortina with around a two-minute lead, leaving him the opportunity to savour the crowds cheering as he came to the finish line for his first major victory. He ran a smart race. Krogvig had also raced hard and smart and unfortunately for Dapit took the third and last place on the podium. Fabien Antolinos on his way to winning the 2017 Lavaredo Ultra Trail. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell The announcers called her the ‘Queen of Cortina’ and who could deny her that title, Caroline Chaverot powered her way to the finish line to claim yet another impressive victory and her second at Lavaredo. Croft had run a tough race, had tried to hustle Chaverot, but was out paced. That said, she never gave in and was rewarded with second place. Borzani ran strong all the way, holding third place from way back before Refugio Aurunzo but was unable to sustain the pace of either Chaverot or Croft.

2017 Western States 100 Results,"Hot weather and the snow, mud, and water remnants of a 100-year winter event in California’s Sierra Nevada worked together to create difficult racing conditions for the 2017Western States 100. It was in those conditions that South Africa’sRyan Sandesand the USA’sCat Bradleywon. This was Sandes’s fifth shot at the race, and it improves upon his previous second place, fifth place, DNS, and DNF. And Bradley’s win represents a breakout performance among a super-competitive field in her first go at the event. Top finishers in both the men’s and women’s fields are the runners who seemed to tolerate the conditions and race with a self-preservational style.Alex NicholsandMark Hammondrepresented the rest of the men’s podium, whileMagdalena BouletandSabrina Stanleymade up the balance of the women’s. A special thanks toDrymaxfor making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible! Thanks also toAltraandGU Energyfor their support of our Western States coverage. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Just 3.5 miles into the 2017 Western States 100, over the race’s high point at 8,713 feet,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) led the entire men’s field by seven minutes, making a straightaway statement that he, indeed, would try to carry out his pre-race plans of racing these 100 miles aggressively. The next time that the iRunFar team saw Walmsley, atop Red Star Ridge 15 miles into the race, he’d grown his lead to 18.5 minutes. By all descriptions these 15 miles of trail contained the remnants of the region’s 100-year winter of snow, mud, running water, downed trees, and obliterated trail surfaces. It was conditions which slowed the rest of the field considerably—from the front to the back of the pack—but conditions which Walmsley most certainly pushed through. Jim Walmsley topping out on the Escarpment at mile 3.5 well ahead of everyone else. Photo: iRunFar/Jake Beiler From here to mile 56, at Michigan Bluff, Walmsley significantly increased his gap on the rest of the field. Here it is in numbers: at mile 24 he was 30 minutes up on the field, 37 minutes at mile 30, 40 minutes at mile 38, 38 minutes at mile 43, 47.5 minutes at 48 miles, and 56 minutes at mile 55. Each time that we saw him during this stretch, he looked pretty darn solid to us. That said, looking back on how Walmsley’s day would ultimately play out, perhaps there was at least one clue that things weren’t quite perfect. At mile 38 in the Dusty Corners aid station, Walmsley spent a full 4.5 minutes. A couple of those minutes went similarly to the other lead men—where he spent time dousing himself with water and ice and hydrating—but he also spent a couple minutes stretching, talking about “resetting,” and kind of just standing there. At mile 62 in Foresthill, Walmsley’s gap over the rest of the field began to decrease. Even worse, his crew would later report that he vomited there. Mile 71, about halfway between Foresthill and the river crossing along the infamous Cal Street, Walmsley reported stomach issues again. The heat of the day was at this point on, with temperature reports of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Michigan Bluff and the mid-90s in Foresthill, what amounts to just a bit above normal for this region. Between there and the river, Walmsley’s race fully fell apart and he ended up laying on the ground and in the shade. He’d eventually make it to the river crossing at mile 78 and drop, citing that he hadn’t been able to eat in hours. It was thusly gastrointestinal distress—a common ultrarunning ailment especially in long races with hot temperatures when the stomach fails to digest at normal rates due to blood shunting from the stomach to the extremities to help cool the body—that appears to have ended Walmsley’s day. Jim Walmsley (left) ending his day at the river. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell And then there was the rest of the men’s field and men’s race, which seemingly operated on a parallel but equally dynamic storyline. Rewinding to mile 15, we weren’t surprised to see the chase pack being led by Sweden’sElov Olsson—who threatened in hispre-race interviewto do so—and France’sErik Clavery, who always starts races fast. At mile 24, the men shuffled places and South Africa’sRyan Sandes(finish-lineandpost-raceinterviews) had moved into second position, with Olsson and countrymanJonas Buud(pre-race interview) running together in third and fourth positions. I was actually surprised to see Buud as far up as he was here relative to the bulk of the men’s field, as he’s typically a conservative starter who moves up later. This makes me wonder if Buud’s racing strategy was influenced by wanting to run with another Swede or something else? By mile 30, Sandes was starting to make his mark on the race and setting himself apart from the rest of the field. Though he was 37 minutes back of leader Walmsley, he was now eight minutes ahead of every other runner. This situation—Sandes in second position and set ahead of the rest of the men’s field—would continue for some 40-plus miles to where he would overtake Walmsley and move into first place. Once Sandes took over the lead, he had 22-plus miles to the finish. In that time, Sandes would increase his gap over the rest of the field from a little over 10 minutes to 29 minutes, demonstrating his capability and strength in the day’s difficult conditions, first snow and mud and more in the race’s first 15-plus miles and then the normal-but-always-baking heat later. Ryan Sandes winning the 2017 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The race for the men’s top 10 continued to be dynamic and enthralling. Early pace pushers Buud and Olsson still occupied third and fourth positions at mile 30, though Buud had gapped Olsson by five minutes. In the fifth position at mile 30 was now Clavery. Move eight miles down the course to Dusty Corners and the game changed again, with Clavery and Olsson dropping back as opposed toChris DeNucciandAlex Nichols(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) moving up. While we couldn’t know it just yet, this was a foreshadowing of what was yet to come. Fast forward to Michigan Bluff at mile 56, and Buud was at the cusp of falling out of the men’s top five as he began to struggle. At the same time, Nichols moved up to third position looking calm and collected in the canyons during the heat of the day. Also having moved up was Spain’sTòfol Castanyer, who had been running in fourth at Michigan Bluff before missing a turn, spending significant time off course, and dropping back many places on his way to Foresthill. Alex Nichols enjoys the shade of his hat at the American River crossing. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By mile 71, the men’s podium was sorting itself out, as Nichols and, now,Mark Hammond(post-race interview) had floated to the top and held steady in their positions of third and fourth. That said, Hammond pressured the heck out of Nichols in the race’s final quarter. Between the river crossing at mile 78 and the Auburn Lakes Trails aid station at mile 85, Hammond cut the gap he had to Nichols from 10 minutes to three. This drama heightened, though, because when Nichols and Hammond crossed the iconic No Hands Bridge at mile 97, they were separated by just 30 seconds. Nichols must have absolutely hammered starting then, as upon hitting Robie Point, the top of the final climb and just 1.3 miles from the finish, a full four minutes separated the pair, how they’d ultimately finish. Mark Hammond after placing third at Western States. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Now what about the rest of the men’s top 10? Well, now is presently a great time to be a fan of trail ultrarunning, where competitive, long races like this one continue to move and shake all the way through the finish. Remember that guyJeff Browning(pre-race interview), who finished third last year? Yeah, he’s someone you just don’t want behind you at any point of the second half of a long ultra—he’s got a career that’s built on passing late-race carnage. Browning, who would ultimately finish fourth, didn’t even see the back end of the men’s top 10 until mile 78. Wrap your head around that one. By mile 94, Browning moved into fourth position and hammered that one all the way home. Though Browning has loads of 100 milers under his belt—a great knowledge foundation—25-year-oldAvery Collinsplayed the field in precisely the same manner. In basically an 8.5-mile stretch of trail starting at Foresthill, mile 62, he ran from 13th into sixth position. It appeared that he continued to push from there home and we saw him move up to as high as fourth place before he ultimately finished sixth. A lot of racing wisdom in a 25 year old! And what would a modern-era Western States top 10 look like if it didn’t includeIan Sharmanand his very similar second-half-move-up strategies? M6 last year, Sharman brought home the M7 position in 2017. One more dude raced like this, too,Jesse Haynes, 10th last year and now eighth this year. Future men’s top-10 hopefuls, take note that Browning, Sharman, and Haynes were close together in 15th through 18th and an hour off the lead and five minutes out of the top 10 at mile 30.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell DeNucci took home M9 last year through a steady-eddy, all-day performance, and same goes for this year. It seemed he was decisively present in the middle part of the men’s top 10 in the race’s first quarter, and though he hopped around positions pretty much all day, he improved to claim the M5 position for this year.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Scotland’sPaul Giblin, who took fifth last year, went on a rampage during the first half of Cal Street after Foresthill—not unlike Collins—and moved up from 10th to fifth position. It was a spot he would not be able to hold, however, as he would lapse back to his ultimate ninth-place spot. Paul Giblin just after his second-straight top-10 finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Last year’s M8Kyle Pietari(post-race interview) rounded out the men’s top 10 as he limped over the finish line, needed to be carried away from it, and claimed his belt buckle at the award ceremony the next day on crutches. We learned that he sprained his ankle by rolling it badly at mile 7. That makes it all the more of a feat that he landed in the M10 position. Kyle Pietari finishing out another top-ten finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Early pace pushers Castanyer, Buud, Olsson, and Clavery all finished, but outside the men’s top 10 in 11th, 12th, 13th, and 16th overall, respectively. Particularly heartbreaking has to be Castanyer’s finish in 11th after a 12th last year, just outside the men’s top 10. Tòfol Castanyer ran with heart. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. Check outvideos of the top-three men finishing. The 2017 Western States 100 men’s top 10. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It is safe to say that the 2017 Western States 100 women’s race was highly anticipated. Three previous champions, some more world-class talent, and a boat-load of up-and-comers among the entrants list made all of us talk about the potential of a race for the ages. Add in heavy doses of high-country madness via reportedly soul-and-shoe sucking snow, mud, and water as well as the usual heat ingredient and, when all was said and done and the ladies connected the dots between #seeyouinquaw and #seeyouinauburn, actuality equaled hype. I realize I’m a woman and probably biased in my interest of women’s races, but holy hell the women’s race! Amidst the insanity of Jim Walmsley’s early gap on the men’s field, I failed to notice the significant early stamp that Switzerland’sAndrea Huserwas making on the women’s race, after initial leaderCamille Herron(pre-race interview) quickly succumbed to the high-country’s snow and mud. When we first saw Huser at mile 15 along Red Star Ridge, she was a full seven minutes in front of all the other women, what amounts to an effort at nearly 30 seconds per mile faster than the rest of the field. Whoa. Some 15 miles later, at the mile 30 Robinson Flat aid station, Huser remained seven minutes ahead, holding steady. Everything changed, though, at mile 38, whenYiOu Wang(pre-race interview) cruised in, leading the women’s field, having sliced through all of Huser’s lead and gapped her by more than 1.5 minutes. At this point, Huser began to continuously slip back in the women’s field. Andrea Huser would hold on to finish 10th. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Let us thus move on to phase two of the women’s race for the win, where Wang led and was closely chased by several other women. Each time we saw the women at miles 43, 48, 56, and 62, Wang was ahead, but it was close—a few minutes here and there separated her from her chasers. At Foresthill, mile 62,Cat Bradley(finish-lineandpost-raceinterviews) was second just seconds behind. Nonetheless, Wang looked rock solid as she headed down Cal Street after Foresthill. All of this would change in just a few short miles as she would—like men’s leader Jim Walmsley—come to a full stop on the ground. Wang experienced some serious health issues that she would describe later on social media as numbness and hyperventilation. A lot of time passed (during, as we understand it, she was observed by the race’s medical team) before she’d get up, walk to the Peachstone aid station at mile 71, and withdraw from the race. Phase three of the race for the women’s lead began on the trail before Peachstone, as Bradley—who had been closely lurking at mile 62—took over leadership of the race. Simply said, she ran from there untouched by any other woman for the race’s final 30 miles. That’s not to say that she didn’t feel pressure from behind, as she said after the race that she definitely ran faster because she knew strong women were running swiftly behind her. Though some women may have been trying to hunt her down, she only increased her lead over them. When Bradley passed a soon-to-DNF Wang between miles 66 and 70, the former was 13 minutes ahead of the next woman still chasing her. After that, she led by nine minutes as mile 78, 12 minutes at mile 80, 13 minutes at mile 85, 12 minutes at mile 94, 15 minutes at mile 97, and 18 minutes at the finish. Bradley closed out phase three in the race for the win as the women’s champion in, undoubtedly, a huge breakout performance. Cat Bradley cooling down before the river crossing. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Magdalena Boulet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),2015 Western States champion, andSabrina Stanley(post-race interview), another young runner having a breakout performance, would cross the line in second and third place, completing the women’s podium. Though they finished with just 22 minutes separating them, their journeys there were unique. Boulet ran most of the race in the women’s top five and among the women in the race’s final two thirds who were constantly pressuring the race leader. Boulet would say after the race that the high-country conditions took a lot out of her legs and that, as a result, she was forced to run carefully for many miles in order to manage her physical well being. That said, I think all bets were officially off during the final 25 miles or so when she was working hard, running swiftly, and hunting for the lead. During this, we saw her four times, at miles 80, 85, 94, and 97, and the woman definitely had her chase on. Stanley, on the other hand, raced for the first 30 miles outside of the women’s top 10, cracking it for the first time at the Robinson Flat aid station, mile 30. She’d stay there at mile 38, run in 11th at mile 43, and in 11th again at mile 48. After that, at mile 56 in Michigan Bluff, she’d moved up to eighth place, but she was only getting started. A few miles later in Foresthill, mile 62, she was seventh. At mile 71, she had cracked the women’s top five. Holy smokes she was on fire. The overtaking of fourth and fifth places came in due course, and Stanley would round out the women’s podium. Sabrina Stanley making good time through Foresthill. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Fourth-placeKaytlyn Gerbintook a page out of the go-easy-then-chase-hard playbook with her run. Quite honestly, the iRunFar team didn’t even see Gerbin for well over half of the race, as we’d departed aid stations bound for the next ones before she passed through them well outside the women’s top 10, so I don’t know much about how the first two thirds of her race went. However, I do know that the woman must have hammered the bottom half of Cal Street, between miles 71 and 78, as she arrived to mile 78 at the Rucky Chucky river crossing as seventh female. What? Where’d she come from? It went on like this from there to the finish where Gerbin would continue to move up until her ultimate finishing position. Kaytlyn Gerbin finishing in fourth. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell New Zealand’sFiona Hayvicefinished fifth! We’d watched her race a couple times at the Tarawera Ultramarathon, so we were aware of her ability to race well on her home turf. Thus, I was interested in seeing how she’d shake out among the high-level field assembled at Western States. Well, things shook out pretty darn well! Like so many of the women who ultimately finished in the women’s top 10, a conservative start, gradual move-up into the top 10, and steady finish formed her winning recipe.

Ildikó Wermescher at the Western States finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Tenth place was, finally, Huser, the race’s early leader who began a slow slip back in the rankings starting at mile 38. She’s world class, though, having won and placed high in some of the world’s toughest ultramarathons. It seems that she used that same talent and drive to hold onto a top-10 position. It’s hard to imagine that we could get this far in our description of the women’s race and not have mentioned two of the three Western States champions who started–and finished–the event, 2014 champStephanie Violett(pre-race interview) and 2016 winnerKaci Lickteig(pre-race interview). Suffice it to say, both women suffered to finish, respectively, in 12th and 16th places. Both women factored into the front of the women’s race all day long, with Lickteig even running in or just outside of podium position as far as 47 miles into the race. Various physical issues beset them both, however, and though they slowed significantly, they each chose to stick it out to the Placer High finish line. Stephanie Violett coming through Foresthill.

2017 Trail World Championships Results,"In the steep, forested mountains of northern Tuscany, Italy, outside the little village of Badia Prataglia, the 2017Trail World Championshipstook place on theTrail Sacred Forestsrace course. With 50 kilometers and nearly 3,000 meters of climbing on a relatively non-technical course, it was Team France who dominated the women’s team race, taking the team gold medal, withAdeline Roche(post-race interview) emerging as the women’s individual trail world champion. In the men’s race, Team Spain dominated the team race and took home team gold, withLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) successfully defending his title and winning the individual race for the second time in a row.

It was the USA’sLadia Albertson-Junkansand France’sAdeline Roche(post-race interview) who took out the women’s race, sharing the lead at 9 kilometers, weaving in and out of the men’s field. They were not alone, however, as a big pack of women was strung out behind them in short order, most immediately France’sAmandine Ferrato(post-race interview) and the Netherlands’sRagna Debats. Italy’sSilvia Rampazzorounded out the women’s top five there. Among this group of early leaders, the only familiar face from previous Trail World Championships was Ragna Debats, who was returning following her third place last year. Adeline Roche and Ladia Albertson-Junkans lead at 9 kilometers. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The next time we saw the women at 19 kilometers, at the top of the major climb of the race’s first half, the women’s field had stretched out some, with Adeline looking comfortable and comfortably in front of the rest of the field by about one minute. She climbed with ease, jogging the steeps. Behind her was Amandine, moving just as well, but looking like she was working harder. Ladia had shifted back to third place, but literally just steps out of second, and with fourth-place Ragna just a few steps behind her. Thus, the big story at this point was leader Adeline gapping the rest of the field. Amandine Ferrato at 19km. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks At 29k, just after they finished the first of two big climbs in the race’s second half, Adeline was now two minutes off the front and looking strong. We began to think that this road runner who had recently taken up trail running and who sports a 2:38 marathon best was putting away the race. Amandine ran in second place, now two minutes off the front, still looking like she was putting a lot of effort into her run, but also still moving really well. This pair had two totally different run styles, but both looked just great. Italy’s Silvia Rampazzo had now moved up to third place. Ladia had dropped back a spot to fourth place, but looked well on the flat dirt road here. Ragna now was in the fifth-place position. Ladia Albertson-Junkans at 29km. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Outside of the top-five women, there was a gap to the rest of the women’s field, but a heated race was happening, and, to be clear, Team France was coming on really strong. At 29k, members of Team France occupied positions 1, 2, 6, 7, and 10. With only three members scoring for the team, there was tons of room for things to go wrong for someone–or two women. Foreshadowing? Nope, Team France would close the race’s final 21k just as well as they were running here, and absolutely kill the rest of the women’s team race. A gold medal for Team France again. Nathalie Mauclair under control at 9km. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Adeline struggled some with stomach issues in the race, and as part of this, she gave back all of her lead over the race’s final third. Near the end of the race, Amandine caught her. Across the line the women would go one-two and three seconds apart from each other, Adeline in first and taking the title of individual trail world champion. They grinned and celebrated together, clearly happy for each other. After the race, Amandine said that she wanted her friend to win, and that she was happy to finish second and help guarantee a Team France victory.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It was quite a while until we would see third-place Silvia Rampazzo at the finish–some 11 minutes–but she was welcomed with a lot of support in being the top finisher of the home team. As someone we haven’t seen race until recently, we’ve now watched her run an impressive double: second at theZegama Marathontwo weeks ago and, now, third here. She passed on doing an interview with us both times, so we’re not able to provide much other information about Silvia and her performances.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Everyone I heard talking about the race at the finish line said that Team USA took the men’s race out hot and that the early part of the race was influenced by their efforts. Among Team USA it wasAndy Wacker(pre-race interview) leading the race full-on at 9 kilometers in. Inside the top 10 there were loads of U.S. men still:Cody Reedin fourth,Hayden Hawksin seventh, andDavid Rochein 10th. Holy smokes! Defending championLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) shared second place with France’sCédric Fleureton(post-race interview), a former international-level triathlete trying international trail running for the first time. Andy Wacker in the lead at 9km. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell We spotted the men next atop the big climb to 19k, and Andy remained in the lead. To be honest, though, he didn’t look that good in comparison to the men behind him. Nevertheless, he maintained a gap of 45 seconds over second-place Cédric, who looked everything like a mountain goat scampering up the steep hill. What impressed me the most, though, was the breathing of Luis in third place and just under two minutes back. Let’s just say that he was working incredibly hard. Another minute back at this point was Finland’sHenri Ansioand France’sNico Martin, who was returning to the Trail World Championships to defend his second place here last year. At this point, USA still had two more men inside the top 10, sixth-place Cody and seventh-place David. Luis Alberto Hernando at 19km. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks At 29k, after the runners reached the top of the race’s third big climb and along the dirt road there, Cédric was now leading the men’s race with Luis running two minutes back in second. Both of this pair looked quite strong and Andy, who had led the race for its first half, had dropped back to seventh place while bonking. Cédric Fleureton at 29km. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks In the back half of the men’s top 10, we saw two members of Team France–Nico andLudovic Pommeret–and two members of Team Spain–Cristofer Clemente(post-race interview) andDaní Garcia–both working together as pairs. What this meant was that, with 21k to go, the team race between Teams France and Spain was really tight. Gone from the top 10 was Team USA aside from Andy, butMario Mendoza, who was looking like he was just getting started, ran in 11th and Cody and David ran in 13th and 14th, both looking neither stellar nor terrible. Team USA was holding in bronze-medal position. Daní Garcia and Cristofer Clemente working together at 29km. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks When we spotted Cédric Fleureton and Luis Alberto Hernando at 39k, Cédric still held his gap of two minutes over Luis, but Luis looked like the stronger man and that it was only a matter of real estate until he took over the lead. Sure enough, on the tough terrain of the ridgeline between 38k and 44k, Luis put the hammer down and took over the lead, and the rest was history. Finland’s Henri Ansio continued to run in third, but was more worried about those behind him than in front of him. Henri Ansio running in third at 39km. Photo: iRunFar. We have to seriously tip our hats to Cristofer Clemente. Check this out: 31st place at 9k, 18th at 25k, ninth place at 29k (and eight minutes back!), eighth place at 35k, fourth place at 39k, and second place at the finish line–just a minute back from winner Luis. For anyone who says that you have to stay in contact with the leaders early if you want to podium in a trail ultramarathon–even a ‘short’ one–there’s an incredible lesson in Cristofer’s performance. More often than not, the way to run your own best race is to run your own race. Cristofer Clemente charging hard at 39km. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Cédric Fleureton ultimately finished in third place, succumbing to leg cramps in the final 12 kilometers, but still finishing strong as the first finisher of Team France. Finland’s Ansio finished in fourth place, ending an all-day strong performance. Rolling over the finish in fifth was Daní Garcia, meaning that Team Spain would take the team gold medal.

2017 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Results,"On a warm, dry, and windy day at the 2017Zegama-Aizkorri MarathoninBasque Country, Spain, localMaite Maiora(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)scored her first win of a cherished-to-her race, and NorwegianStian Angermund-Vik(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)stuck it in his first outing at Zegama in besting the men’s race. With good weather, dry course conditions, and solid strategical racing by both of them on their sides, Maiora and Angermund-Vik also came home with new course records. We’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Basque runnerAritz Egeawas the men’s pacesetter in the early miles, including the short glory lap around town after the start before hitting the hills. This was not a surprise, as we’ve seen Egea go out at the front each year we’ve watched him race here. The guy looked like he was having a ball, though, smiling widely as fans cheered his name, high fiving people here and there, and lifting his hands into the air to garner more fan reaction. At Aratz, the first mountain summit 16 kilometers into the race, Egea led the lead trio of him, Japan’sRuy Ueda, and Italy’sMarco De Gasperi. Aritz Egea taking the very early lead at Zegama. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell On the steep and technical downhill from Aratz to Sancti Spiritu, located at 20k, De Gasperi took over the lead, but Egea remained just moments behind. Sancti Spiritu is an incredible place–I know this is a report about the men’s race, but something just needs to be said about what it was like there. Located about 400 meters above the town of Zegama and in a difficult-to-reach location that requires driving up a one-lane mountain road and a steep hike from the road to the aid station, Sancti Spiritu hosts thousands of fans who make a human tunnel through which runners climb uphill toward the race’s second summit. Given this year’s warm and sunny weather, many more people came out to cheer than normal, and the tunnel of fans was narrower and longer and wilder than ever. The spirited scene of Sancti Spiritu is truly iconic in our sport of trail running. Norway’sStian Angermund-Vik(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who was fresh off a win of Friday’s Vertical Kilometer race and who earlier had passed through Aratz, 16k, in eighth place and three minutes off the lead, somehow looked fresher and more energetic than many of the other men at Sancti Spiritu, 20k. On the climb to the second mountain summit, Aizkorri before 24k–which actually leads onto a very technical ridgeline for a few kilometers before a wicked-steep downhill–he continued to move up in the field. By the time he came off that ridgeline, he’d overtaken the lead and had shaken loose of everyone in the men’s field besides De Gasperi. Finally, in the more runnable terrain to Urbia at 28k, he gapped De Gasperi by two minutes. At Andratz, the top of the final climb 30k in to the race, his lead was around three minutes, and he’d maintain that gap on the blazing-fast downhill from there to the marathon’s finish line in downtown Zegama, finishing in an official 3:45:08, well clear ofKilian Jornet’s3:48:38course record from 2014. Stian Angermund-Vik about to make his charge on the climb from Sancti Spiritu. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell De Gasperi, too, closed the race strongly. From Andratz, 30k, to the finish line, 42k, he gave back no more time to winner Angermund-Vik and he increased the gap between he and third-placeMarc Lauenstein(pre-race interview), of Switzerland, from under two minutes to more than five minutes. De Gasperi’s official time of 3:48:20 was also inside the previous course best and five minutes faster than he’s ever run here. At the finish line, De Gasperi attributed his fast time to both feeling strong in the race’s second half as well as the day’s weather and course conditions. Marco de Gasperi also went under the old course record. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Third-place Lauenstein took what looked like a similarly conservative approach as winner Angermund-Vik, running the race’s first half in the back half of the men’s top 10. At Aratz, 16k, he summited the mountain in a train of five men running together in fifth to ninth place, which given that there was a really strong wind high on the mountain, looked like an smart strategy of working together and preserving energy. By Aizkorri before 24k, the top of the second mountain, Lauenstein moved into fifth position, and then up to third place by 28k. Marc Lauenstein would take third at Zegama 2017. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell In the end, Egea would be the first Basque runner home in finishing fourth, and France’sAdrien Michaud, who ran consistently inside the men’s top 10 the whole race, rounded out the men’s top five. This year, the top-six men all finished inside of the revered four-hour barrier, which we would say is roughly average over recent years at the race.

I admit that I didn’t know much about Italy’sSilvia Rampazzoahead of this race, but apparently I should have because she absolutely rampaged Zegama, running hard from the start and setting the pace over much of the race’s first half. Sixteen kilometers into the race at the first mountain summit of Aratz, Rampazzo looked super comfortable off the front and in the very strong winds there. Again at Sancti Spiritu, 20k, and through the more-than-half-mile-long tunnel of fans, she pushed the hill, leaning into it, pressing down hard on her legs, and doing all that hard work with a smile. Silvia Rampazzo in the lead at Sancti Spiritu. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell That said, behind Rampazzo for the race’s first half, there was a lurkingMaite Maiora(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). At Aratz and Sancti Spiritu, Maiora ran in second place less than 30 seconds off the lead. Though she looked like she was physically working hard, there was also a sense of psychological peace in the expressions on her face. The wind of Aratz didn’t seem to bother her, and she climbed through the throngs of Basque fans screaming her name at Sancti Spiritu calmly and smoothly. Honestly, she looked great. It was not a surprise, then, to see her top out on Aizkorri, the second mountain summit, with a 90-second lead. Maite Maiora upon winning Zegama in a course-record time. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Maiora would say at the finish line that she thought Rampazzo was tiring on the climb to Aizkorri, but that she also said that she was mistaken in thinking so as, in reality, Rampazzo still had a lot of fight in her. In the runnable terrain around Urbia at 28k, Rampazzo reeled Maiora back in to within about 20 seconds. Maiora would later say that she had to find another gear to climb the final mountain to Andratz at 30k, so that she could gap Rampazzo again. At Andratz, Maiora had reestablished her 90-second lead and, then, increased it by another almost 90 seconds from there to the finish line. Maiora’s celebration at the finish was emotional. Tears, smiles, and something like 30 minutes of continual embraces with her family and friends followed her 4:34:27 finish, what amounts to a huge new course record, close to four minutes better thanEmanuela Brizio’slongstanding4:38:19record from 2009. Rampazzo’s performance was one of all-day strength. She crossed the line in downtown Zegama looking tired, relieved, but still so strong. Her 4:37:17 finish was also inside the previous course record. At the finish, she would say that she was only wanting to finish the race, and not expecting to win. Last year’s terrible weather forced her to drop from the race, and she wanted to avenge her DNF. Not only did she avenge 2016, but in the process she ran the second-fastest-ever time in the race’s long history. The third-place finish of Spain’sSheila Aviléswas another surprise for us–we didn’t even put her in our extensively researched preview, and no readers marked her as one to watch, either. We learned at the finish line, too, that Zegama was Avilés’s first marathon-distance race! Well, she picked a difficult one to start with, didn’t she? It seems that Avilés has been racing sky races for a couple seasons with success in both Spain and Italy. If Maiora and Rampazzo were the aggressors pushing the pace at the front in the women’s race, then Avilés was the more conservatively paced runner. At Aratz and Sancti Spiritu, she was in sixth and fifth places, respectively, and she would continue to move up in positions until reaching her ultimate finishing place by Urbia at 28k. Avilés had a really strong final 14k, all the more impressive given that it was her first marathon. At Urbia, she was eight minutes behind winner Maiora, and then nine minutes back at the finish line–she closed the race at almost the same pace as the women’s champ. Even more evidence to her well-metered effort, in that same distance, she shook loose from several other women who were still within seconds to finish third and with no other women in sight for some four minutes. Basque runnerOihana Azkorbebeitia, who ran much of the race in the back half of the women’s top 10, would move up to finish fourth place, and France’sCelia Chironfinished fifth, a position she ran in for much of the race. Just as the four-hour barrier is well respected in the men’s race, so is the five-hour barrier for the women. This year, 11 women finished inside five hours, many more than what is the average.

2017 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results,"Tim Freriks(post-race interview) andIda Nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) put on master-class performances to win the 2017Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Nilsson’s win was a solo run from almost the start to the finish, and Freriks managed to shake his pursuers along the race’s highest country after midway to run unchallenged from there to the finish line.

Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci As every year, Transvulcania gathers some of the best athletes of our sport from all around the world. And for the first time in a few editions, the guy who pushed the train from the start at Faro de Fuencaliente was the one crossing the finish line in first. Both of the USA,Tim FreriksandHayden Hawks(pre-race interview) looked like they were running a team race for some time. France’sLudovic PommeretandNicolas Martin(pre-race interview) were also seemingly working together, a few meters back–something really nice to see in this individual sport. The Americans ran fast from the beginning, breaking from the field by Los Canarios, the first aid station. They kept working to open that gap, making it over three minutes to the chasing field at El Pilar, 26 kilometers into the race. The chase pack there was made up of Pommeret, Martin,Xavier Thévenard(France), Scotland’sTom Owens, and Spain’sZaid Ait Malek(post-race interview), and it was collectively working hard to shorten this gap. Tim Freriks, 2017 Transvulcania Ultramarathon champion. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Things changed on the way to El Roque de los Muchachos, where Hawks paid for his effort and fell behind Freriks and, then, the rest of the lead group, but he continued on to finish line in a gutsy effort. On the other hand, Freriks had a difference of almost 20 minutes to his chasers, facing the vertiginous downhill from 8,000 feet above sea level to the ocean at Tazacorte. We’ve seen this movie before here at Transvulcania, and usually, the U.S. dude doesn’t have the happy ending he wishes to have. But breaking precedent, Freriks handled the downhill in a fantastic way to hammer the last climb from El Puerto de Tazacorte to the finish line in first place and bring the win to the U.S. again in 7:02:03. Ludovic Pommeret on his way to a strong second place. Photo: iRunFar/Nacho Barranco Frías Pommeret showed his patience and expertise by opening a gap to the chase group in the downhill. He separated from the group just after El Roque de los Muchachos, and finished in second place in 7:18:15. But the podium wasn’t closed, and the fight for that final spot was hectic. Thévenard fell behind the group before the highest part of the race andOwens dropped from the group when the downhill started, as an injury kept him from showing his skills in this area. Everything was prepared for Martin to jump on the podium again. But Ait Malek played his cards brilliantly and flew down to Tazacorte, marking the fastest downhill split, and finishing in third place in 7:26:31. Martin was finally fourth, less than two minutes back, in 7:28:08. Zaid Ait Malek took over the third podium position in the race’s final section. Photo: iRunFar/Nacho Barranco Frías Daniel Jung(Italy) andHector Haines(U.K.) made great progressive races, finishing in fifth and sixth positions. They also fought for those spots in the last six kilometers of the race. Thévenard ended in seventh place,Dmitry Mityaev(Russia) eighth,Jason Schlarb(USA) ninth, andManuel Anguita(Spain) 10th. Amazingly, while first through fifth places were separated by 33 minutes, the fight in the back half of the top 10 was tight with a spread of just 11.5 minutes between fifth and 10th places. Full results. Before the race, we chatted with Sweden’sIda Nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and she said she was feeling fine, in good shape. That was certainly the truth. Exactly as last year, she broke herself from the rest of the field and ran her own race in front, pushing hard from start to finish. As far as 23 kilometers in a 75k race, she already had a gap of over eight minutes to her immediate follower,Anne-Lise Rousset(France). Just as last year. Nilsson mastered this course again, winning this race from start to finish, finishing in the top 20 overall in 8:04:17. Just to add a detail, she suffered a fall in the downhill that required a few stitches in her knee. Ida Nilsson, 2017 Transvulcania Ultramarathon champion. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Rousset had to fight to keep her second place. Even though she ran by herself in this position for most of the race, the difference between she and her chasers was really close. And that’s because the USA’sHillary Allen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andRagna Debats(Netherlands) were working progressively and pushing each other for the podium spots. So close was that, at the 50k mark in El Roque de los Muchachos, the gap between the three was only six minutes. Rousset to Allen four minutes, Allen to Debats only two minutes. But this race is always defined in the downhill and this was no exception. Rousset managed to open a few more minutes that allowed her to repeat last year’s second place in 8:32:15.

Photo: iRunFar/Nacho Barranco Frías Even though she suffered some cramps in the downhill, Allen escaped from Debats and improved her fifth place from last year to a third place this year, in 8:38:46. Finally, Debats was fourth in 8:45:22. Hillary Allen on the bottom part of the race’s 8,000 foot descent.

Russia’sEkaterina Mityaevawas seventh,Cassie Scallonfrom the U.S. was eighth, France’sSarah Vieuilleninth, andKristina Pattisonfrom the U.S. rounded the top 10. Similar to the men’s race, the spread between fifth and 10th women was much less–26.5 minutes–than the spread between first and fifth–59 minutes–making the fight for positions tough and tight in the back half of the top 10.

2017 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results,"The 2017Lake Sonoma 50 Milewent off without a hitch on the relentless hills above Lake Sonoma west of Healdsburg, California. Some muddy patches and a small but steep reroute meant that for the first time in the race’s nine runnings, neither the women’s nor men’s fields saw a new course record. Still, the women’s race sawYiOu Wangrun a wire-to-wire defense of her win from last year, whileKaci LickteigandMagdalena Bouletran the entire race together in second. On the men’s side,Sage Canadayled from the race’s midpoint withDakota Jonesnever falling far behind, and the pair ultimately finishing one-two. Read on below to find out more fully how the women’s and men’s races unfolded. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back. Many thanks toNathanfor their generous support of our coverage of this year’s Lake Sonoma 50 Mile. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The 2017 women’s field amounted to large group of ladies with diverse backgrounds and skill sets–previous Lake Sonoma champs,Western Stateschamps, long-distance specialists, and more–a set-up for a truly fascinating women’s race. When we caught a glimpse of defending championYiOu Wang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) before the race start, it seemed clear that she was all business and here to get the dueling jobs done of running for the win and earning a Western States entry in this final race of the Altra Golden Ticket Series. YiOu ran the entire race off the front, picking her way through the men’s field even, until she finished as champion for the second time, ninth overall, and in possession of a spot in this year’s Western States field. Her 2.4-mile split was 16:57 elapsed, which is 7:04 minute-mile pace, and from there she just kept pressing on as the terrain allowed. Her 7:24 finishing time–what amounts to 8:53 minute-mile pace on a course with some 10,500 feet of climbing–did not match her 2016 winning time, but was probably a nearly equal effort given the course’s reroute and muddy conditions. YiOu Wang closing out her second-straight Lake Sonoma win. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Somewhere in the first couple road miles,Kaci Lickteig(pre-raceandpost-raceinterview) andMagdalena Boulet(post-race interview) fell into step with each other, and, seriously, the rest is history. The pair would later say that they somewhat unintentionally ran together until the halfway point, and, then, they began to intentionally work together, with Magda adding her strength to pull the pair up the uphills and Kaci using her strength to help them find another gear on the downhills. Every aid station, the pair entered and left together, full on hamming it up for volunteers and fans. They were legitimately having a good time. In the end, the pair crossed the finish hand-in-hand, Magda earning her Western States spot and Kaci, who did not need a spot in Western States as the reigning Western States champ, overwhelmed with happiness. It looked like a good day in paradise for this pair, and it was one of the finest examples of competitors working with each other that I’ve personally seen in trail running.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Every time we sawCourtney Dauwalter–at mile 2.4, 11.6, 19.5, 25, 30, 38, and 45.5, phew!–she was in fourth place. She ran fleet footed and metronome-like–you could see why she’s the 24-hour American record holder, able to hold steady effort from start to finish in an event.Julia Stamps Mallon, sixth a year ago here, moved up a spot to finish fifth.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks With five or so men with great leg speed from track-and-field and road-running careers in this field, everyone expected the men’s race to go out hot, and indeed it did. A lead pack of five men–Jared Hazenwas setting the pace withRyan Bak,Chris Mocko(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Patrick Smyth(pre-race interview), andSage Canaday(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) all together–split the first 2.4 road miles at 6:06 minute-mile pace, hit the trail, and just kept rolling.Dakota Jones(post-race interview) was just a couple seconds later leading a long string of chasers. Mile 11.6, some nine miles of singletrack later, saw little change in the lead pack of five, except that Dakota joined it while Chris dropped back by two minutes, saying later that he struggled to keep the pace in the early climbing. The lead men hit mile 11.6 in 1:19 elapsed, which works out to 6:48 minute-mile pace. They were still flying. Sage Canaday in the lead at mile 30. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Rolling singletrack eventually gave way to fire roads as well as a couple longer climbs and descents between miles 18 and 31. This totally shook up and wrung out that lead men’s pack. Sage would emerge at mile 30 with a 90-second lead over Dakota and a five-minute gap on third place Chris. These three men would remain in these positions all the way through the finish. Between miles 30 and 38, the gap between Sage and Dakota increased to three minutes, 45 seconds, and I began to think that the rest would be history. Anything’s possible in ultrarunning, though, and at the mile 45.5 aid station, Dakota was arriving just as Sage was leaving, their gap at about one minute. Both would later say they were suffering in that last section due to the race’s fast early pace, but Sage was able to hold off the stalking Dakota, and they went one-two at the finish. Chris rallied from his early race difficulties to finish third. Sage’s final time, 6:17, was five minutes off his fastest time here in 2014, and works out to 7:32 minute-mile pace. I’m guessing the course reroute and mud more than attributed to Sage’s slightly slower time compared to the past. I’ve watched these guys race Lake Sonoma for years now, and I’m always impressed that they are able to keep this kind of pace on the constant hills and arrythmic nature of this course.

At the time of this writing, we understand that both Sage and Dakota will forgo their Golden Tickets, and third place Chris already has an entry from his top-10 Western States finish last year. The series rules allow the tickets to roll down as far as fifth place, so it looks like Zach and Jared will be offered Golden Tickets. More fruits of the labor of their consistent efforts start to finish. Zach Szablewski took fourth at Lake Sonoma. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results.

2017 Transgrancanaria Results,"Transgrancanaria2017 saw plenty of great racing as well as two new champions inAzara GarcíaandPau Capell. The weather was predictably dynamic with a nice start, cold winds in high locations, fog and drizzle at night on the island’s north side, and increasing temps after daybreak on the sunny south side. Read on to find out what happened in the men’s and women’s races. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. This year’s Transgrancanaria was dominated by Catalan runnerPau Capell(pre-andpost-race interviews). He had a lead from the two-kilometer mark to the finish. He did see his 10-minute lead disappear when he took a wrong turn after Fontanales (43 kilometers) at which point he briefly ran with Lithuania’sVaidas Žlabys(post-race interview) before re-establishing a lead that he’d never relinquish. Pau Capell in Tunte on his way to wining 2017 Transgrancanaria. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Žlabys went out hard, sticking nearDiego Pazosof Switzerland and Spanish runnerJordi Gamito. By Fontanales at 43 kilometers, Žlabys and Pazos were together in second with Gamito in fourth andMaxime Cazajouswho’d consistently moved himself up in the field through the race’s first half. Cruz de Tejeda at 67 kilometers saw teammates Pazos and Gamito come through together in second, while Cazajous had moved up to fourth and Žlabys had fallen back to fifth about four minutes behind second. That would all change by the next checkpoint, Roque Nublo, 12 kilometers later, where Žlabys was again in second, Gamito in third, Pazos in fourth, and Cazajous in fifth… and switching wasn’t done yet! Vaidas Žlabys finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It’s true that Žlabys would hold on to second throughout the rest of the race, but three other runners would hold onto third. Gamito would run in third for some time before dropping back to fifth suddenly on his way to the race’s final checkpoint at Parque Sur only 3.5 kilometers from the finish. Similarly, Cazajous ran in fourth all the waypastParque Sur. What they didn’t see coming was theDidrik Hermansen(pre-andpost-race interviews) train. The Norwegian moved up throughout the race. He was in 19th at the first checkpoint 10 kilometers into the race and still in 13th at the 33-kilometer mark. Then eighth, sixth, seventh, fifth… and, finally, third, as the later stages of the course suited Didrik’s speed almost as well this year as they did last year. Gamito would move up again in the race’s final few kilometers to join Cazaous as they tied for fourth. Didrik Hermansen, the defending champion, on his way to placing third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spanish runnerAnthony Gayran in the back half of the top ten all day, holding sixth for the last third of the race.Benoît Girondelof France was brilliant in his methodical advancement through the field. Runner by runner, he moved himself up from the mid-teens to finish seventh. After challenging at the front of the race through mid-race, Diego Pazos gradually dropped back to finish eighth. The U.K.’sAndy Symondsslowly worked his way up to seventh through the first half of the race before slowly falling back to ninth in the race’s later stages. With a few wiggles up and down along the way,Timothy Olsonof the U.S. ran near tenth through the entire race, which is where he ended up. In a rare occurrence for an ultra of this sort, there were no prominent DNFs among the early frontrunners, although, of course, there were some a bit further back in the field.

She dominated this year’s race much likeCaroline Chaverotdid last year andNúria Picasdid in 2014. She held the lead from go and didn’t look back on her way to winning by the better part of an hour in what was her first race of 100 kilometers or more. As reference from the men’s field, she moved up from the mid-5os position-wise in the first third of the race to finish 35th overall. Azara García upon winning Transgrancanaria 2017. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell WhileAndrea Huser(pre-andpost-race interviews) of Switzerland repeated her second-place finish, it didn’t look that way early on. She started out in the back part of the women’s top ten and came into Fontanales (43 kilometers) together in fifth with another runner more than half an hour after García and ten minutes behind fourth place. From there, she steadily worked her way up. Andrea Huser finishing second for the second-straight year. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sMélanie Rousset(post-race interview) andKristin Berglundof Sweden were both on strong, but slightly different trajectories through the day. Berglund went out a bit harder, running a spot in front of Rousset until the pair left Fontanales together withMercedes Pilaof Ecudaor. Rousset would move ahead in the kilometers that followed, with the pair finishing in third and fourth. Melanie Rousset descending into the Fontanales aid station.

2017 Tarawera Ultramarathon Results,"Jim WalmsleyandCamille Herronran with off-the-front authority for 102 kilometers through the lakes, forests, and hills between Rotorua and Kawerau, New Zealand to win the 2017Tarawera Ultramarathon. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Is there anything else to say except thatJim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was dominant? From “go,” Jim set the pace. He was accompanied for some four kilometers before breaking free of everyone else and running solo for the next 98k to the finish line. We’d prepared a set of “Walmsley absolutely ridiculous splits,” which we developed based upon a 7:15 finish time that we thought implausible, but not impossible. However, we basically ended up using them to key our next moves all day long. When the route came out of the woods briefly at just over 11k, Jim came out talking about how he’d almost been knocked out cold by a run-in with a massive tree branch a kilometer or so prior. He was okay, all was okay, and he would later say he continued on without more than a few-seconds delay. At 57k, it looked like he might be experiencing a low point. He later attributed it to the fact that he was coming off the race’s most technical terrain where he tried hard to chill and not push hard. On the cruise-y terrain after 72k, I’m guessing Jim’sGPSdata will show he logged some of his fastest splits. Without a doubt, Jim’s performance was a step above what men are doing at the ‘front of the pack’ in our sport right now. Jim Walmsley running strong late in Tarawera. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks In the days ahead of the race, defending championJonas Buud(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) defined his goals around improving upon his own previous performances. He simply wanted to run faster this year than last year. Ultimately, he found himself limited by problems running downhill starting at 30k into the race, what would evolve into blown quads by the finish. After the race he said that perhaps this was the result of less running training and more cross training over the winter and unseasoned quadriceps. Despite his ailing quads and running a bit slower than last year, he held things together better than everyone but Walmsley, and ended up in second place. As early as around 11k into the race, Jonas had settled into his totally expected position, within the chase pack of men running a controlled pace. It would be ages and ages, until something like two thirds of the race had passed, that he would be able to shake the rest of the runners and assume the second position, which he would hold to the finish. Jonas Buud wrapping up another podium performance at Tarawera. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Before the race, several people said in describing New Zealand’sSam McCutcheon(post-race interview), “He’s the real deal.” The guy who’s had a couple years of success nationally took things abroad in 2016 to take 10th at the Buff Epic Ultra, one of the Skyrunning World Championships races. All of what we knew about him led us to believe that he could contend for the men’s top five. And here he is, having finished third, a position he ran near to for much of the race, and less than two minutes out of second place. From the very first time we saw him after 11k, he was in the top-five mix, a position he’d maintain all race. Sam moved up into third position in the race’s final quarter, easing up close to, but never in sight of, second-place Buud. Sam McCutcheon making himself known outside Australasia with his third-place finish. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks David Byrne(pre-race interview), second here last year, came back for a fourth-place finish, running a couple minutes faster than 2016. 2016 Ultra-Trail World Tour championGediminas Griniusrounded out the men’s top five with a totally steady performance. Full results. [We’d previously listedBen Gerhardyas the tenth-place man, but he’d dropped down to the simultaneous 87k event.] Lithuanians Andrius Ramonas (left) and Gediminas Grinius after they took sixth and fifth, respectively. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks I find a number of fascinating parallels between the men’s and women’s races. Both champions ran off the front, without cueing from their competitors for pretty much all of the race’s 102 kilometers. Both second places described their days as equivalents of ‘not easy,’ yet they persevered through in solid positions and fended off tough and talented fields of women and men. And both third places are more local stars who broke out into the world of international competition with their performances here. Let me elaborate a bit on the women’s side of things. From the start,Camille Herron(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) set into what she called a sustainable pace for her, holding it–and the lead–all the way through the finish. She would later describe her experience as an incremental step forward in her still-developing career in trail running. She described feeling the changes in the trail, like curves, rocks, and other technicalities, and responding to them by easing off the effort and moving comfortably through them. Last year when bonking during a race, she discovered beer as a way to refuel. Employing that strategy here, she said at the finish that she drank 24 ounces of beer in the race’s second half. At each aid station, Camille added small amounts to her time gap on the field, what would lead to a 24-minute win. She looked a little rough at the finish, having put it all out on the trail, but revived after a bit to join the day’s festivities. With her dominant performance here and following a challenging 2016, it looks like Camille has returned to the form we saw her first enter our sport with in 2015. Camille Herron winning Tarawera 2017. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Magdalena Boulet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) would say after the race that the day wasn’t easy, but that she made it through. I’m of the opinion that Magda suffers better than most because, honest to goodness, I can hardly tell when she’s having a hard time. Magda ran in second position for pretty much the entire race. At times, she looked quiet and focused, while in others she opened up smiles for her husband and son, who crewed her. Early on, she kept the gap to leader Camille within just a couple minutes, before it opened wider in the race’s second half. Magda was challenged by a late-charging Cecilia Flori during a time when she didn’t feel very well. The pair worked together before Magda pulled ahead to take second by a narrow margin. Magda Boulet finishing Tarawera in second with her son… just ahead of her. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Cecilia Flori(post-race interview) is Italian who lives in New Zealand. To be frank, at the time of this writing, we don’t know much about her–we’ll interview her post-race, though, so stay tuned! As far as we understand from iRunFar’s Kiwi friends, Cecilia is a relatively new trail and ultrarunner, and possibly a new competitive runner. In 2016, she won another local race, the Taupo 100k, in a time that would have been quite good for many men and a time that made people take notice of her. For whatever newness she may have, Cecilia did not come out of the gate carefully and conservatively.

2016 The North Face 50 Mile Championships Results,"A combination of perfect weather, a slightly different course, and ridiculous competition led to incredibly fast times at this year’sThe North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Mile Championships. After fierce battles,Zach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andIda Nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) came out on top with fast finishes right behind them fromHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andMagdalena Boulet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Truly, this year’s race was the pinnacle in the event’s 10-year history in the Marin Headlands. Below, we dive into the full story. Zach Miller after winning his second-straight TNF 50.

Over the past decade, there have been few things more spectacular than watchingZach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) go out at breakneck pace in races and, often enough, sticking it. Well, today that was topped byHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) getting into a veritable game of go-for-it chicken against Mr. Miller with the only loser in the deal being the six-hour barrier. From the gate, Miller went to the front only to have Hawks charge off and push the pace. Back and forth it would go for much of the day. Neither relented despite running “stupid” per Miller. Sometimes you jump on the crazy train and it takes you to an incredible destination. Such was the case today. With roughly 5 kilometers to go, Zach still had a mere one-minute lead to his credit so he ran 16 minutes to the finish to win by barely two minutes. This duel from gun to line was incredible to witness in person. Hayden Hawks continuing his charge at mile 32. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Behind Miller and Hawks there were three sets of folks toward the front: the implosions, the steadies, and the chargers. In the early going, folks likeCody Reed(pre-race interview),Benoît Cori, andTim Freriksamongst others went out within sight of the leaders to fade quite a bit later on. In the middle, folks likeJorge Maravilla(pre-race interview) were Mister Consistents. I don’t think I saw Jorge outside of the range of fourth-to-sixth place all day. He finished fourth. Greek runnerDimitris Theodorakakossits ninth, eighth, and eighth in my notes before finishing sixth. Likewise,Paddy O’Learyseemingly hung around ninth or 10th place throughout the day. Some folks would drop back fast, a few others would sneak past, but on Paddy would go to take ninth. Dimitris Theodorakakos shows that there’s something still to be said for running a consistent effort. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Dang, if there’s someone that’ll have a leader checking his shoulder at the end of an ultra these days, it’sDavid Laney(post-race interview). He was in 11th at mile 20 and was in fourth 13 miles later. He’d finish third. I’m pretty sure thatAlex Nichols(pre-race interview) had to come from a lot further back to take fifth. He was in the late-teens at best at mile 10 and only cracked the top 10 nearly two thirds of the way through the race. David Laney continuing his charge toward the podium at mile 32. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell A couple of folks in the top 10 escape these classifications.Sage Canaday(pre-race interview) led the chase behind Miller and Hawks for much of the race, often sitting in third. All that early speed slowed Sage later, but he still hung on for seventh. Then there were the two breakthrough performances run byErik SorensenandBrian Condonto take eighth and 10th.

This year’s female championIda Nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) is a two-time NCAA Division I champion in the 5k and steeplechase from her collegiate career at Northern Arizona University and a 10-time Swedish national champion in track and field. That is to say that she has wheels and among the fastest raw leg speed in the women’s field. Her entrance into trail and ultrarunning beginning in 2015 has been quickly successful, with her 2016 including big wins at Transvulcania this spring and, now, the TNF 50. Ida Nilsson running strong at sunrise. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Ida’s race today seemed smooth as butter, with her running in second position for the majority of the race behind early and long-time leaderMegan Kimmel(pre-race interview), the defending champion. Her late move for the lead didn’t become apparent until mile 44 when she had overtaken the lead and started building the six-minute gap she’d have over the rest of the field by the finish. A hip injury in the fall had required her to do much of her training on skis, rather than long runs, and she had said before the race that she wasn’t sure how the later miles would go. Well, numbers don’t lie, and her strong close to the finish shows that she’s well converted her track-and-field legs to the rigors of the hills. Megan Kimmel still cruising in the lead at mile 32. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Magdalena Boulet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) has become something of a Bay Area trail running queen in the three years since she debuted at ultrarunning at the 2013 TNF 50 and finished second. Everywhere we went, people knew of and actively cheered for Magda, and she waved, smiled, and high fived back. If anything, she was the fan favorite. Magda Boulet getting plenty of crowd support at mile 32. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell To be honest, Magda didn’t quite look like Magda to me until we saw her just beyond the halfway point, and she would say after the race that she struggled to find her legs until after Stinson Beach at mile 30, attributing this fact to her race at UTMB a few months ago, its requisite recovery, and perhaps not quite enough training for this year’s race. But when we saw her after the halfway point, it was like her focus had returned and her stride had opened and the Magda we know was back in the race. Fourth here last year,Ruth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) moved up a spot to finish third, and ran 10 minutes faster in doing so. This year, she employed a more conservative start, and didn’t move herself into the realm of podium position until about halfway through the race. At around mile 25, Ruth and Magda were running together in third and fourth, a battle that would continue for some miles. In this section, Ruth would also briefly give challenge to Ida, who at the time was running in second position behind the still-leading Megan. Ruth would ultimately drop back behind Ida and Magda, but her conservative start perhaps led her to run strong to the finish for third place. At mile 32, Ruth Croft runs in third, which is where she’d finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Fourth place went to CanadianAnnie Jean, whose best performance in trail and ultrarunning until now is probably a 12th place at the 2016 World Long Distance Mountain Running Championships. She’s also been the winner of many local ultras in Canada. As early as mile 10, Annie was running in sixth position, a spot she would roughly hold for quite a long way before she would pick off a few positions for fourth place. Annie Jean coasting along along the coast. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Clare Gallagherran an impressive race in that she went out close to the leaders in the early going, dropped back to the 10th at mile 32, before fighting her way back up to fifth at the finish. If Clare yo-yoed a bit,Sandi Nypaverwas a winch in that she started a ways back and kept reeling in the runners ahead of her. She didn’t crack the top 10 until around mid-race, was eighth by mile 25.5, and finished sixth.Kasie Enmanran a consistent race, hanging between fourth and sixth for most of the race before finishing seventh.

Early leaderMegan Kimmel(pre-race interview) suffered calf issues late in the race that quickly dropped her back to 10th. If we recall correctly, a similar issue afflicted Kimmel late in the 2012 edition of the TNF 50. Stephanie Howe Violett closes out a rough 2016 with a ninth-place finish.

2017 Western States 100 Lottery Results,"The lottery for the 2017Western States 100took place today, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. However, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. A total of 4,248 runners entered the lottery for the 2017 edition, up from 3,510 applicants for the 2016 race and 2,566 for the 2015 edition. A total of 11,021 tickets went into today’s drawing representing those runners. The starters list in June of 2017 will ultimately contain 369 runners, a number decided by the race’s permit through the Granite Chief Wilderness. Among this there will be 117automatic entrants(some decided and some yet to be decided), 2 that were drawn from those who were in the audience for the lottery itself, and 250 runners who were chosen in today’s lottery. An interesting change was announced to the WS100 entrance process this past July, and will be implemented for the first time this year, a 50-person ‘General Wait List.’ If a registered entrant decides not to race, members of the waitlist will move onto the entrants list. Today, that wait list was also filled from among the lottery entrants. The WS100 website has an up-to-date list of the 2017 Western States 100entrantsas well asthe wait listers. Let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into WS100 so far. The women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2017, and every woman has chosen to do so! The men’s top 10 from 2016are also invitedto return. The only man who has chosen not to return isDidrik Hermansen, who took second place. This number of top-10 returnees (19 out of 20) is believed to be a record and is truly indicative of the prestige associated with a top-10 finish. These are some speedy men and women who achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methods. Here they are and how they obtained their entry: A total of 250 names were drawn during today’s lottery, and among them were a small number of speedy and notable athletes. Here are the top entrants on the 50-person General Wait List: Top runners still have three routes by which they can gain non-lottery entry into the 2016 WS100. Golden Ticket Races The six-raceAltra Golden Ticket Racesoffers up to 24 WS100 entries will be given to top finishers of these races. The series remains unchanged in the number of races participating, which races, and the system by which runners can gain WS100 entry. Basically, the top-2 men and top-2 women finishers of each race gain entry, and if they already have an entry or if they decline it, the entry rolls down as far as fifth place. Ultra-Trail World Tour For 2017, six slots are given to top international contenders via the WS100’s participation in theUltra-Trail World Tour.Update, December 22:The race administration has announced the UTWT slots today. They are: UltraRunningRace Series TheUltraRunningRace Serieswill award entry to the male and female runner at the top of its ranking on April 30, 2017. For the first time, the Western States 100 granted entry to one runner over the age of 60 who has made outstanding contributions to ultra running in general and Western States in particular.  The first recipient of the ‘Silver Legend Award’ presented at the conclusion of the lottery was 17 time Western States finisherScott Mills.

2017 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"Congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2017Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run! This article breaks down the results of today’s lottery for the run’s 2017 edition. First, we begin with a few statistics and background information. This year’s lottery entrants list was up to 1,966 applicants. For perspective, the lottery for the 2016 edition had 1,549 entrants, and the previous year was 1,367 applicants. These 1,966 entrants were represented by 8,490total ticketswhich went into today’s lottery ‘buckets.’ Prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants into one of three divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with Hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. The divisions are ‘Veterans,’ runners who’ve finished Hardrock more than five times; ‘Nevers,’ which are runners who’ve never finished Hardrock; and ‘Everyone Else,’ runners who’ve completed the event between one and four times. For the 2017 lottery, there were 43 Veteran applicants who had 404 tickets, 1,722 Never applicants with 7,339 tickets, and 201 Everyone Else applicants with 747 tickets. The 2017 edition will feature 145 starters, a decrease from 152 starters from 2016. This change was announced by the event organization in late August to address adverse impacts on the event’s quality and management as a result of 152 entrants, their pacers and crew, and those who attend in person. As a result of the change in field size, there was a change in the number of entrants selected from each division. Today, the event organization selected 33 Veterans, 45 Nevers, and 67 Everyone Elses. For perspective, the 2016 edition contained 35 Veterans, 47 Nevers, and 70 Everyone Elses. Run DirectorDale Garlandprivately chose five of the entrants, ‘Dale’s Picks,’  and the balance of the entrants were chosen from the lottery ‘buckets.’ The 2016 event represented a decrease from the past in terms of the number of runners who got into the event off the three separate devision-specific waitlists. For the 2016 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrants spots only 4deep in the Veterans division, 4 deep in the Nevers division, and 7 deep in the Everyone Else division. For the 2015 edition, the waitlist went to 8 deep for the Veterans (which included all of the Veterans on the waitlist that year), 9 deep for Nevers, and 12 deep for Everyone Else. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end continues to grow in competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which Hardrock prides itself upon. Below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2017 contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in. Let’s start with the men’s competition.Kilian JornetandJason Schlarbtied for the win in the 2016 run, and they’ve both chosen to use their automatic entries for the 2017 edition. So there’s that.Additionally,Zach Miller, who has been absolutely on fire over the last several years, will add an interesting mix up front.Iker Karrerawill return for another go on this course that suits his talents, andAdam Campbellwill be coming back from a recent near-fatal climbing accident after two podium finishes in 2014 and 2015. You can never count out a guy likeMike Footewho was runner up to Jornet in 2015 and does well on this brutal course. As usual with Hardrock, there are several very competitive veterans includingScott Jaime,Karl Meltzer, andJoe Grant.Chris Pricealways seems dialed in at Hardrock and he will be looking to improve on his two fourth place finishes. When all was said and done in the women’s 2016 race, championAnna Frostsaid she was sure she’d return to the 2017 race, but that she was unsure if that meant as a competitor or as a volunteer. It looks like she’s chosen to be a competitor.While it is hard to imagine anyone challenging Frost after last year’s victory, there is some amazing competition on the women’s side this year. One runner that could pull the upset isDarcy Piceu, a three-time winner at Hardrock. Piceu and Frost leap-frogged during a very competitive 2015 Hardrock, and we’ve all been waiting for the rematch. Both of these runners will be pushed hard by 2015 UTMB champNathalie Mauclairwho seems to excel in any terrain. Throw inCaroline Chaverot, who is on fire in the trail-ultrarunning scene and who is coming off a 2016 UTMB victory, and you have the most competitive field in history up front for the women’s Hardrock title. Third- and fourth-place finishersBethany LewisandDarla Askewwill be returning after big days at last year’s Hardrock, andRachel Bucklinwill be trying to best her seventh-place 2016 finish. You can never count out the indefatigableBetsy Kalmeyer, who will be seeking her 18th finish and who was second as recent as 2014, andBetsy Nyewho has been on the podium 11(!) times at Hardrock and who was sixth this year. Here is the full list of who was chosen in the lottery, and on the various waitlists. Let’s get on with the full lists of who is in, who may be, and who is definitely not. There is only one way to gain auto entry into Hardrock, and that is by winning the prior year’s race.Kilian Jornet,Jason Schlarb, andAnna Frosthave all chosen to use those entries. Here are the notable men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Here are the women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Here are the front-end men’s contenders who were chosen in the top-10 slots of the Veterans waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Nevers waitlist, or the top-20 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These men have some shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. Here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-10 slots of the Veterans waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Nevers waitlist, or the top-20 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These women have some shot of running. Here are some fast men who are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in.

2016 IAU Trail World Championships Results,"After they both finished second last year, Spain’sLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and France’sCaroline Chaverot(post-race interview) won the 2016IAU Trail World Championshipsheld on a never-raced-before course in and around Peneda-Gerês National Park in northern Portugal, which mixed all kinds of terrain but trended toward Euro-style tough and technical on a warm, humid, and smoky day. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Above-treeline beauty on the 2016 IAU Trail World Championships course. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell 2016 IAU Trail World ChampionCaroline Chaverotof France ran like she wanted that title–with other women at first, then setting a pace that she would be able to maintain to the finish, and going to battle for the win when things got tight. Her victory was among the closest and most exciting we’ve see in long trail ultras of late. A woman who often races off the front at breakneck pace, Caroline ran the first 15-ish kilometers in the vicinity of other women, including Spain’sAzara Garcíaand Sweden’sEmelie Forsberg(pre-race interview). Even at 30k, more than one third of the way into the race, Caroline led, but not by more than 90 seconds. This, however, I am guessing was a product of the dueling desires of Caroline racing easy enough so that she could run hard later and the women behind her wanting to stay in contact. Caroline Chaverot on her way to winning the 2016 IAU Trail World Championships. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The lead pack would lose one of the race favorites, Emelie Forsberg, around 33k. Most in the trail-ultra world know by now that Emelie damaged her knee in a ski race last winter, and underwent ligament-reconstruction surgery and rehab. This was her first 50-mile race since then. Compounding that, she’d recently spent a month in yoga-instructor training, which precluded almost any run training. She would say from the sidelines later, after dropping, that her knee just wasn’t ready and that it was smarter for her to bow out. It was then the Netherlands’sRagna Debats(post-race interview) who quickly moved into podium position. By 40k she was firmly planted in third, a spot she’d stick to all the way to the finish. Ragna lives in Catalunya and has ability and prowess on Europe’s technical terrain, though as far as we understand, her podium position today is a breakout performance by a long ways. Though Caroline was in first, Azara second, and Ragna third by 40k–positions they would maintain to the finish–the women’s race was far from over. At 54k, as the lead women dropped into the village of Lindoso and past its medieval castle, Caroline had built an almost-five-minute lead, and Ragna was strung out a bit more than two minutes after Azara. Just 10k later, though, in the village of Soaja, only three minutes total separated first through third places. However, by the time we saw Caroline next at 75k, she’d gotten word of how close her chasers were, and she was in serious ‘go’ mode. The woman was giving everything, pushing, breathing hard, so focused. She’d rebuilt an almost-five-minute lead, which she would maintain through the finish. Azara García climbing toward the course’s high point and on her way to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Let’s put it this way, I think Azara knows how to suffer. When we saw her last at 75k, when she was being chased closely by Ragna, she was deep in the pain cave and giving it. It was perhaps because of her ability to motor through difficulty that she increased her lead from one minute at 75k to three minutes at the finish. To be sure, this was the tightest women’s podium race we’ve seen at a long ultra in quite a while. Ragna Debats would take third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The steadiness of the women’s competition would not end there. When all was said and done in the top 10, 65 minutes separated first and 10th place. For perspective, 49 minutes separated first and 10th at last year’s The North Face Endurance Challenge 50-Mile Championships, though that race ran a full 2.5 hours faster. And the spread between the men’s top 10 at this race was 41 minutes. It’s possible that this women’s race is of the kind of depth we’ve not yet seen in trail ultrarunning. Two-time defending IAU Trail World ChampionNathalie Mauclair(pre-race interview) of France put most of her racing eggs into this basket. After a mostly quiet season and two IAU Trail World Championships victories in a row, I think Nathalie really wanted to win again. However, we learned at the finish that she took a hard fall on the first major descent and injured her ribs. She said that every downhill step from there was painful and that she considered dropping several times. In the end, I think Nathalie’s perseverance and desire to help with Team France’s performance won out, and she slowly moved up positions to finish fourth. Spain’sGemma Arenastook fifth in what looked like a steady performance start to finish. Sixth place was Switzerlands’sKathrin Götz, who I admittedly know nothing about except that she finished second at the Eiger Ultra Trail this year, a half hour behind trail-ultra superstar Andrea Huser and a few minutes ahead of Juliette Blanchet. Great Britain’sJo Meek(pre-race interview) andBeth Pascallfinished seventh and eighth. The Czech Republic’sMichaela Mertová, who has seen some success in the Skyrunning sphere, was ninth. Spain’sTeresa Nimestook 10th for the second year in a row with France’sAurelia Truelshortly behind her in 11th. The pair completed the team duel for the win. The combined three fastest times are used to score, and it was Team France with the finishes of Caroline Chaverot, Nathalie Mauclair, and Aurelia Truel whose combined times were the fastest. Team Spain took a very close second for the second year of the row, finish less than 14 minutes behind the French. Nearly two and a half hours behind the French, Team Great Britain rounds out the women’s team podium withJo Zakrzewskias the third scoring woman in 29th place. Full results. It’s funny, going into UTMB a couple months ago, Spain’sLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-race interview) seemed so calm, comfortable, and, well, freaking fit. It almost felt sure that he’d be on the men’s podium there. But things went real wrong when he got debilitating blisters and dropped near the halfway point. Perhaps there are blessings in curses, though, that he didn’t make it all the way through 100 miles in late August, which left him fresh for the IAU Trail World Championships. That said, going into this race, he hedged his own bets, leaving us all wondering if he was trying to let us know that perhaps he wasn’t quite ready for this race. That said again, as soon as the race started, you could see the fire in his eyes and the fluidity with which he moved. It was easy to see as early as 30k that Luis was in it to win it. Luis Alberto Hernando, 2016 IAU Trail World Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks He bided his time, however, running among the leaders until after 40k. Somewhere between there and 46k, on the long climb to the course’s high point, Serra Amarela, Luis made his move. When we saw him on the far side of the mountain at 54k, he’d put some 3.5 minutes on France’sNicolas Martin(post-race interview), who was seventh at the world championships last year, and defending championSylvain Court(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), with whom he’d been running at 40k. His lead increased, and his focus and pushing also seemed to. The dude was steam-train-esque. Luis’s lead grew to as much as 13 minutes at 75k as he ran through a tiny village called Bomio, before it reduced to 10 minutes at the finish. Sylvain Court headed toward third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks I would venture a guess that the reduction in Luis’s lead in the final 10.5k was not a matter of Luis letting up on things, but, rather, due to the fight going on between Nico and Sylvain behind him. The pair were running what must have been at times in the last 20k in sight of each other, and they have a long back-and-forth racing history. They have gone head-to-head in just the last year-and-a-half in at least four big races: the 2015 IAU Trail World Championships (Sylvain bested Nico), the 2016 Transvulcania (Nico beat Sylvain), the 2016 France Trail National Championships (Nico was declared the winner over Sylvain), and here (Nico bested Sylvain). The gap between Nico and Sylvain’s respective finishes would be only 33 seconds at the finish. Ultimately, half of the men’s top 10 filled with Frenchmen, withBenoît Coritaking fourth,Ludovic Pommeretfifth, andAurélien Colletseventh. Each of these men seemed to employ the strategy of running smart but staying in contact with the leaders as much as possible. The exception to this would be Benoît at 30k, where he—but only briefly, as we understand—led the men’s race. This would mean a handy men’s Team France victory for the second year in a row. Peppered in between Team France was sixth placeDiego Pazos, who hails from Switzerland and who first came on my radar when he took 11th at the 2014 UTMB, eighth placeTòfol Castanyerfrom Spain, ninth placeAndy Symondsfrom Great Britain, and Germany’sStephan Hugenschmidt. Among these four men, Diego and Stephan seemed to hold steady for much of the race while Tòfol and Andy shifted around a bit more, Tòfol while suffering and recovering from stomach issues, and Andy from perhaps starting a bit more slowly and moving up later. Team Spain men took second place in the team competition, withPau Capellfinishing 11th and becoming the third scoring team member. I believe that the German team featuring Hugenschmidt,Florian Reichert, andMartin Schedlerwas the third-place team.

2016 Diagonale Des Fous Results,"With start-to-finish domination of their respective men’s and women’s fields,François D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andAndrea Huser(post-race interview) won theDiagonale des Fous, the 167-kilometer (104-mile) race which climbs 9,700 meters (31,800 feet) this weekend on Réunion Island.

Additionally, since this is the first time iRunFar has covered the event and not a lot is known about it in the English-speaking trail world, we thought a baseline description of the race might be beneficial. The Diagonale des Fous was first run in 1989, and so the now 850,000 inhabitants of Réunion Island have had two-and-a-half decades to develop a relationship with the race. And what a relationship they have! The term ‘crazy’ is often applied to the race, and that’s a great basic description of fans’ excitement about the race. We heard estimates that some 20,000 people were predicted to watch the start and that 10% of the population would physically watch the race from somewhere on the course. And local radio and TV stations offered nonstop race coverage for days, so many more followed remotely. I would sincerely be surprised to meet an islander who hasn’t heard of the race. DdF has become one of the island’s main annual events and it captures everyone’s attention. [Editor’s Note:You can learn more about the race’s long history and its place in Réunion Island culturewith this essay.] Many DdF fans behave like trail running fans I’ve seen around the world, but there’s a good deal of ‘freneticism,’ too, though that’s almost entirely focused on the lead couple men. Though I can’t say for certain, it’s an educated guess based on observing the movements of other media that this is a result of local media focusing mostly on the lead couple men. I would venture a guess that, further back in the pack, and even with the top women, fans are still quite interactive in cheering for runners, but less wildly so. What do I mean by frenetic? Smashing beer bottles in excitement at the start. Jogging behind the leaders for some distances. Creating a funnel of fans with hands reaching in to touch a runner as they pass. The starting line in Saint-Pierre, a large city on the southwest part of the island, is a true spectacle. The race organization presents a festival-like environment for non-participating islanders to come out and enjoy themselves. A concert of rotating local bands begins four hours before the race start. Circus-type performers rove the crowd. People sell glow sticks, glow necklaces, glow pinwheel thingys, and noisemakers from rolling carts. Others sell beer, water, and soda, and there are food trucks offering all sorts of food. At first the atmosphere is chill, with a core group of people in front of the concert stage dancing and partying. But starting about 90 minutes before the race, excitement mounts and people swarm, looking to get a view of the 50 or so top runners who are funneled into an ‘elite’ area and to get a viewing spot for the race start. The 2016 Diagonale des Fous starting-line party. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The 2,500 or so runners are blocked off from the public into their own area. It’s not huge, but big enough for anyone who wants to sit or lay down to do so. It has one row of portapotties, but I was told that people urinate freely all over the participant area. There are also some tents offering drink and food for participants. This was by far the most solemn part of the start area–the runners largely lay about quietly, conserving energy. About 30 minutes from the start, the organization funnels participants into a street-wide chute connecting the 400 meters or so between the runner waiting area and the actual starting line. The energy of the five minutes it takes to do this is nuts. A line of volunteers links arms and strings themselves in front of the mass of runners to prevent a mad rush toward the start line (And possibly beyond? One year there was a false start when a loud noise made some jittery runners run off and everyone followed. There was no restart–that was the actual race start that year.) American runnerJoel Meredithdescribed these few moments as chaotic with people sprinting to get an up-front starting place. Once the runners are in place, it’s still a long wait until the actual start, 25 minutes or so. You see all kinds of behavior during this time: everything from runners and fans standing quiet and observing, to other fans leaning into the starting chute trying to get a photo of or an autograph from a runner, to fans and runners dancing and singing. By the time the race starts, the announcers and music have worked everyone but a few runners into excitement mode. Loud and wild is the actual start. The course runs several kilometers on pavement before hitting the trails, and I was told that all of this pavement is a giant fan funnel. François D’haene and Patrick Bohard share a quiet moment among the 2016 Diagonale des Fous starting-line frenetics. François went on to win and Patrick finished seventh. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The course delivers every kind of terrain. There are kilometers of pavement connecting the route into and out of towns and villages. There’s developed singletrack in the national park that makes up the core of the island. There are dirt roads and pathways through private agricultural fields–a lot of sugar-cane fields and grazing grounds for cattle–cut just for the race. At the core of the race course is the Cirque de Mafate, a giant and road-less volcanic caldera that runners drop into at about 75 kilometers and climb out of at 115 kilometers. This section of the race is visually stunning. Everywhere, all the time, is an insane view. Many people recreate on the trails of Mafate, which were first made more than 200 years ago to help slaves flee from their enslaved coastal lives and hide in the cirque. Also, there are several villages where locals live year round in the cirque–maybe 50 to 100 dwellers in each of the villages. Scenery inside the Cirque de Mafate, part of the Diagonale des Fous course. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks When you travel through Mafate during the race, you’re traveling through a ridiculous natural spectacle, the home of several hundred people, and a place where both locals and tourists recreate (and come out to cheer the race). In most races, when you travel through a place as remote and inaccessible as Mafate is, you’d be all by yourself for kilometers at a time. In DdF, you are constantly surrounded by people. A few runners described seeing people every few minutes to every few seconds, at times. The young ladies of Roche Plate, a roadless village in the Cirque de Mafate located at 109 kilometers into the Diagonales des Fous. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Unfortunately, with all these people came trash–produced by both runners and those observing the race. In my mind, there is no excuse for littering, period, let alone in a national park, let alone during a trail race. Respect of nature should be a core value in this situation. The main issue I observed is toilet paper, but runners I talked to also spoke about significant litter from food wrappers. I hope the race organization chooses to address this problem. Built stairs and rocks that require the stair-climbing or stair-descending motion seem like the dominant terrain. The trails do, in fact, have switchbacks, but the switchbacks are still super steep. This year, the course was dry and dusty in places, butGediminas Griniussaid that one year it was quite muddy. While the course seems to always be trending toward ascending or descending, it’s never just doing one or the other. On a long ascent for example, say 800 meters, there will be some significant descent snuck in there. Several runners said that you can’t find a rhythm because of these constant changes. “Unceasing technicality” and “the most technical terrain I’ve ever seen” are two summaries I heard about the course. Runners on the endless stairs of the DdF course. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Helicopter use is a reality on Réunion Island. With such steep and undulating terrain, helicopters help make life happen here. It’s how supplies are shipped into and refuse out of the villages of Mafate, for example. As such, helicopters are wildly used during the race for media–and the helicopters absolutely hound the runners, getting incredibly close to the runners and the ground. If you’re in the top 10 or so, you will be followed closely by helicopters for several daylight hours in total. I’ve seen helicopters at a lot of European races, but never anything like what I saw at DdF. The finish line takes place in a stadium on the edge of Saint-Denis, the island’s biggest city located in the north of the island. Again the carnival-type atmosphere is developed during the days that the racers of the DdF and the two, smaller sister races are finishing. There’s a beer tent, a food tent, booths and shops, a climbing wall, and more. Locals bring lawn chairs, blankets, and coolers, and come and relax for a couple hours at time, likely to wait for a friend or family member to finish. However, the atmosphere is much more calm and with far fewer people than at the start. When the top couple men finish, there are perhaps 1,500 or 2,000 fans in and just outside the stadium. Kind of funny to say there are that many fans on hand for a trail race and yet it had a ‘calmer’ feeling than the start. It’s still a huge party! Second place this year was 10-time DdF finisherAntoine Guillon, who was also last year’s race winner. He’s quite popular with islanders. So, there was a lot of energy for the second-place finisher, too, but far fewer people watching even though he arrived only a half hour later. And then… it got scarily quiet. Crowds gathered briefly again to seeAndrea Huserwin the women’s race, but probably 25% of the number who were there to seeFrançois D’haenewin the men’s race. By the timeEmma Rocafinished in third place, the stadium was absolutely deserted. In all, it was a wild experience to witness and I’m guessing an even wilder experience in which to participate. France’sFrançois D’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was, quite simply, in his own class… for 146 kilometers. For the race’s first 30 kilometers or so, François ran among the lead men before emerging alone at the front at kilometer 35, with no one else within five minutes. He built a lead from there, slowly and surely, until Maïdo at 115k where he was 80 minutes ahead of everyone in the men’s field. On whatever sort of terrain we saw him, he looked calm and in total control. Even when TV cameras chased and helicopters blew debris on him, his composure was rock steady. François D’haene at 29 kilometers into the DdF. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks But as if in prediction of his own future, when asked how he was feeling at 97k, he answered that he felt good but that it was a long way still. When we saw him next at 109k, in the middle of a 2,000-meter climb during the heat of the afternoon, he looked ever so ‘touched’ by the conditions. He sat for several minutes to rest and rehydrate, which seemed to reinvigorate him, and he took off uphill looking really well. To the media in Maïdo at 115k and despite his lead, he admitted that he was feeling tired. François was able to maintain his large lead from there to the town of Possession at 146k. When he ran into town there, while being cheered for by hundreds of fans, you could see he was straining. From there over the next half-marathon distance to the finish, he gave up 50 minutes of his lead. But there was too little real estate left and he had too big of a buffer–François was just too strong–and so he crossed the line as the 2016 Diagonale des Fous champion. He adds this to wins here in 2013 and 2014. François D’haene, 2016 Diagonale des Fous champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks It’s safe to say that France’sAntoine Guillon(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) loves Réunion Island and Réunion Island loves him. Antoine started the 2016 edition as the defending champion and with nine previous finishes, what might amount for some people to a lot of pressure. If Antoine felt any pressure, it was never visible. He’s the kind of guy you’d want around if there was an emergency–calm and able to stay the course no matter what. Fans on the course referred to him as the ‘metronome,’ and this descriptor is so on point! His splits between last year and this year were often within a couple minutes, and his finish time this year was two minutes and a few seconds faster than in 2015. For the race’s first 68k, Antoine ran within the men’s top 10. After that, there’s a gnarly climb to a col. It was in this section that Antoine propelled himself into second position, where he would almost exclusively stay until the finish. Likely a result of his DdF experience and his methodical approach to racing in general, Antoine maintained a strong pace all the way, closing hard on François ahead of him and maintaining the gap between he and third place. Antoine Guillon on his way to second place and his 10th DdF finish at Marla, 80 kilometers into the race. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks It’s a little scary how easy Spain’sJavi Dominguez(post-race interview) made running DdF look. Like Antoine, Javi took things out more conservatively, arriving to the first checkpoint at 15k a few positions outside of the top 10. In the honest uphill from there, however, Javi moved himself up an equally honest number of positions to the edge of the top-five men. By the time he dropped into the Cirque de Mafate at 80k, he was in third position, where he would stay for the entire second half of the race. For the next 50k, however–Javi would later say he had no idea what was happening in the race behind him–he had a string of men breathing down his neck. Finally, at the town of Possession at 146k, Javi maintained his pace while the men behind him slowed ever so much that he increased his gap to fourth place. That said, over the race’s final 21k, the gap between he and second-place Antoine stayed about the same as they progressed separately but at about the same rate. After finishing fifth here in 2014, Javi hit it big this time with a podium finish. Javi Dominguez is elated with third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks South Africa’sRyan Sandesis back. I knew it was going to happen, but just didn’t know when. And to be 100% honest, I wasn’t sure that it would be at this race because he and his wife, Vanessa, just had their first child a few weeks ago–an awesome undertaking. Ryan had a huge 2014, performance-wise, and then he struggled with his health in 2015. And, it seems that the early part of 2016 was about getting his performance back to world-class level. Ryan went out a bit faster than we’ve seen him in other competitive 100 milers, running inside the top 10 straight away. Ryan and France’sMaxime Cazajouscrossed the line together to tie for fourth place. Maxime finished 14th and over 28 hours in 2015 and he returned to better his position by 10 spots and his time by three hours–an incredible improvement.

Did you enjoy theAndrea Huser(Switzerland) (post-race interview) show? Because it was a good one. For the race’s first 15k, Andrea let other women take things out hot, and she arrived to the 15k checkpoint in fourth place. However, in the next 20k, she worked her way through the rankings and into first position by the time we next saw her at 29k. When asked how it was going at this point in the race, her answer was alarmingly casual. Was there even a race going on, at least in her head? It was hard to tell! Boom, boom, boom, at every aid station for the next 90k, she looked fresh and like she was hardly even sweating. And yet, she was decidedly putting time on the rest of the women’s field and, let’s just be honest, the men’s, too. In those 90 kilometers, she went from 54th position to 14th position in the general ranking. Andrea Huser climbing at 29 kilometers into DdF. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks At Roche Plate, located at 109k and halfway up the 2,000-meter climb to Maïdo at 115k, a member of the media asked her if she thought she would win. She laughed as if it was a silly question, perhaps not because she thought it was a sure thing, but because the idea of winning was clearly the farthest thought from her mind at this point. Like nearly all of the runners at this point, she said she was tired and she looked warm in the midday heat. That said, I saw her working it on the balance of the climb from there, and she was moving just fine. She would say after the race that it was the part of the climb above Roche Plate in which she felt the most tired. Impressive, then, that she was moving as well as she was there. Andrea has been on fire with her 2016 season, and here at DdF, she improves on last year’s third-place finish by two places and an hour. Andrea Huser, 2016 Diagonale des Fous champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks France’sJuliette Blanchet(post-race interview) has a chill presence when she races. Quiet and focused, but not edgy. A bit like Javi Dominguez on the men’s side, and such a presence makes running to second place at DdF look far easier than I know it must be. Juliette started the race conservatively, arriving to the first checkpoint, Domaine Vidot at 15k, in about 150th position in the general ranking. She would say later that she doesn’t run as fast as other runners early in races, so she relies on being able to maintain the same effort through a whole event. By 29k, she’d worked her way to sixth position for the women, but was still outside the top-100 overall. And, then, by 51k, she had moved up to second place where she would remain for the rest of the race. While she would stay distant from race winner Andrea Huser, she built a solid cushion over the rest of the women’s field. Two years ago here, Juliette finished second in a late-race sprint with Uxue Fraile. This time, with no other women near, Juliette could take things in and enjoy her second second-place finish. Juliette Blanchet looks chill at Roche Plate, 109 kilometers into DdF, on her way to a second-place finish. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks For Spain’sEmma Roca(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), this race did not come easy. But in talking with Emma pre-race, it was clear she was expecting to be challenged by the course, the heat, and adjusting to the zero-drop Altra shoes she’s been running in for the last three months. It seems she had prepared in advance for an eventuality of fighting for her finish. Emma’s one of the toughest women I know, and to see how hobbled she was after the race–that’s when you know a race is a challenging one. After shifting around positions in the race’s first marathon, Emma settled into third place where she would stay for 120-some-odd more kilometers. Emma would explain after the race that she tried to push the downhill after 115k to make a bid for second place. But she said she just didn’t have it in her body, so she eventually crossed the line in third, a strong first showing at DdF. Emma Roca stays calm amidst pre-race insanity before the start of the 2016 DdF. She went on to finish third.

2016 Ultra Pirineu Results,"Under variable fall weather conditions in Catalunya’s Pre-Pyrenees and mostly within the verdant forests and limestone cliffs ofCadí-Moixeró Natural Park, Spain’sMiguel Heras(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andGemma Arenas(post-race interview) dominated the men’s and women’sUltra Pirineufields, respectively, and emerged as 2016 champions. Ultra Pirineu was the final race in this year’s Skyrunner World Series Ultra division, and Gemma Arenas andCristofer Clementeran away with series victories.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Going into this race, it was easy to call Spain’sMiguel Heras(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) the favorite. The guy has a history with the race that dates back to its first edition, he’s already won the race twice before, and he was just coming into good form again after a bout of injury whereas others were racing as part of an already long season. And, then, seeing him in person before the race only confirmed that he was in form and in focus. You could just feel that he would dominate the race. Miguel spent the first 40 kilometers running mostly with Peru’sRemegio Huaman–who would later drop from the race–before he pushed on the long climb following the aid station at Bellver de Cerdanya (40k), leaving the rest of the field in his dust. From there, it was Miguel versus the course, and he seemed to only get stronger as the kilometers ticked off. When he crossed the line, he bent over, went quiet for a few seconds of self-celebration, and then broke out a big smile as the crowds cheered him on.

He was just right there, all day long, looking a lot like he was on a jog through the park. As the long race went on, he maintained exceptional running form despite hours on his feet and a huge smile on his face for the spectators that cheered for him around the course. While winner Miguel was always a step ahead of him, Jessed was a step ahead of the balance of the men’s field. Jessed Hernandez, 2016 Ultra Pirineu second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The Canary Islands’sCristofer Clemente(pre-race interview) races with quiet confidence. Also, I’m not sure that this dude even broke a sweat–he looked as fresh at the finish line as he did at the start. One thing is for sure, Cristofer races with measured effort. He let something like 10 men run the first third of the race well in front of him before slowly but surely moving up in the field. At the 96k mark, with a short-but-stiff climb and a 10k rocky descent remaining, he rolled into the Refugi Vents delCadíaid station looking casual in fifth place. Between there and the finish, though, the game was on. He passed two men in front of him and won a race-to-the-finish battle with those men that found third through fifth places arriving within 39 seconds of each other. And when he crossed the line in third place with two men breathing down his back, he was still calm and collected. Cristofer Clemente, 2016 Ultra Pirineu third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Peru’sEmerson Trujilloran strong from start to finish and into fourth place, and Spain’sErnest Ausirórounded out the men’s top five. While Cristofer Clemente was the Skyrunner World Series Ultra division winner, France’s Nicolas Martin (who didn’t race this weekend) took second in the series, and Spain’s Roger Viñas was third. The men’s podium was given its awards at a ceremony after Ultra Pirineu in Bagà. Full results. Spain’sGemma Arenas(post-race interview) works it. When she topped out on the 1,700-meter climb which begins Ultra Pirineu, she was grinning widely but also breathing heavily. You could tell that she’d just put out a hard effort, though we would see that she was just getting started and that she had 110 kilometers worth of that effort to give. Little by little, Gemma carved time into the women’s field, creating a 15-odd-minute lead at the race’s halfway point. She would give back a few of those minutes in the next short distance–though I don’t know if that was her going slower or second place moving faster–before she gained back those lost minutes and a few more to arrive victorious in the main square of historic Bagà, Catalunya. The women’s race had one additional bit of spiciness–it started pouring rain not long after nightfall, and fog encapsulated part of the final ascent and descent. This was, clearly, not an issue for Gemma. Gemma Arenas running hard on her way to the 2016 Ultra Pirineu victory. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The U.S.A.’sHillary Allen(pre-race interview) has figured out Skyrunning. Though Ultra Pirineu was a bit longer and with more runnable terrain than a typical race in the Skyrunner Ultra division, she had commanding success. Hillary applies a good dose of intelligence and generally happy-go-lucky attitude toward international travel and racing, and this seems to be a good recipe for her. Hillary acted as a shadow to winner Gemma all day, applying non-stop pressure. Between the 74k and 96k aid stations, Hillary had a rough spell that required her to sit down and eat some food in the 96k aid station. But, third place arrived as Hillary was still there, and this seemingly re-stoked her competitive drive. She hammered the final 14 kilometers. Case in point: With 10.5k to run, Hillary was 30 minutes off the lead. At the finish, she was just 17 minutes back. Yep, she motored. A still-developing runner, I’m eager to see where mountain running takes her. Hillary Allen, 2016 Ultra Pirineu second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Spain’sAnna Cometran right around fifth place for some two thirds of Ultra Pirineu. She would say at the finish line that she wasn’t sure how the race was going to go for her, even when she was a marathon’s distance or more into it, and that she didn’t think she would finish third. But in comparing how she looked with her race peers, her stride was bouncy and efficient and her attitude seemed relaxed. It felt obvious with that comparison that she would shine as the kilometers ticked off, and this was absolutely the case. As late as 96k, she was pressuring the second place, too. She crossed the line in a horrific rainstorm looking perfectly elated with her performance. Anna Comet, 2016 Ultra Pirineu third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Russia’sEkaterina Mityaevaand the U.S.A.’sKristina Pattison(pre-race interview) rounded out the top five. Ekaterina, who is brand new to ultras from shorter-distance races, exhibited the kind of patience you see in experienced endurance runners. Kristina looked strong and relaxed early before succumbing to several physical issues later, which she said required her to walk some of the final kilometers. Gemma Arenas ran away with the Skyrunner World Series Ultra division win, while France’s Anne-Lise Rousset (who didn’t race) was second, and Hillary Allen took third.

2016 The Rut 28k Results,"This weekend has brought runners from around the world to Big Sky, Montana for the three races in the Skyrunner World Series atThe Rut. After covering the 50k distance for several years, this year we switched it up to cover the 17.6-mile (28-kilometer) event which loaded 7,500 feet (2,286 meters) of gritty climbing with a high point of over 11,000 feet altitude atop Lone Peak. It wasMegan Kimmel(pre-race interview) andHassan Ait Chaouwho rose above the rest of the competitive women’s and men’s fields and emerged as victors. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on ourThe Rut 28k live-coverage page.

The 2016 The Rut 28k was theMegan Kimmel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) show from start to finish. As the returning champ from last year, the American had the previous experience of knowing how the course ran on her side, plus her beastly aerobic engine and ability on technical terrain. Even by mile two, with the race barely started, Megan had gapped every other woman by a minute per mile. And she was just getting started. On the steep climb to and the burly drop off Headwaters Ridge, one of the two main climb-descent combos of the course, Megan extended her gap to more than three minutes. And she repeated this on the mammoth ascent to Lone Peak at mile 10, which stands at over 11,000 feet in altitude. On the mountain, her lead was stretched to eight minutes, the largest gap she had on the women all day. She crossed the line looking elated and, quite frankly, like she had a lot left in her legs.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Second placeYngvild Kaspersen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), of Norway, was no match for Megan, but the rest of the women’s field was no match for Yngvild, either. Early in the race, Yngvild and eventual third place Laura Orguéran together, but by mile seven and the descent off Headwaters Ridge, Yngvild stepped ahead of Laura and had built a two-minute buffer over her. From there, the time gap to third place kept growing. Atop Lone Peak, where many were gasping for oxygen or tucking their heads from the below-freezing air temperature and wind, Yngvild just looked amused. A strong showing for her, for sure.

However, it seems that the uber-rocky and technical downhills of The Rut 28k course challenged her, as she took them a bit more slowly and carefully than some of her other competitors. She held tight for the final podium position. Laura Orgué after taking third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. AmericanDakota Jonesset the men’s race pace from early on, leading a long train of dudes lined up right behind him at mile two. He would continue to lead and continue to set himself apart from the rest of the field until the descent off 11,000-plus-foot Lone Peak after mile 10, where he rolled his ankle and was forced to walk off the mountain and call it a day. When Dakota injured himself, it was the SpaniardHassan Ait Chaou(post-race interview) who assumed the men’s lead. Prior to that, Hassan had been running strong in second place since before mile seven, on the descent from Headwaters Ridge, where he was hovering just under two minutes back of Dakota. The gap between Hassan and the rest of the field grew minute by minute as the race progressed, as such that when he crossed the line the men’s winner, there wasn’t another guy in sight for some128 minutes–a relative eternity at this race distance.

At mile two and mile seven, respectively, Kiril ran in sixth and eighth positions. In just two miles, however, on some more runnable terrain between miles seven and nine, Kiril surged and moved into fourth position as he started the big climb to Lone Peak. He gave up a couple positions on that rocky uphill, but took them and more back on the descent afterward. At the mile 14.5 aid station, Kiril ran in second, a position he’d hold to the finish.

He started the race off casually, much like Kiril, running in the back half of the men’s top 10 for the early miles, arriving to the base of the big Lone Peak ascent at mile nine in fifth place. He killed the ascent and, in doing so, launched himself into podium position. After going over the top in third, he lost a position to eventual second-place finisher Kiril, but gained a spot when he went past the ailing Dakota. Ultimately, he crossed the line in third.

2016 UTMB Results,"France’sLudovic Pommeret(post-race interview) andCaroline Chaverot(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) emerged as victors from a truly dramatic 2016UTMB. The women’s race was characterized by two women pressuring each other off the front and steady-as-she-goes forward progress by the rest of the top female finishers. The men’s race story was ultimately shaped by the guys who best navigated multiple levels of racing carnage. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on ourUTMB live-coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to UTMB-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back!

The start of the 2016 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Let’s face it, we’re all a little speechless about what went down on that large loop around Mont Blanc this weekend. As our volunteers were staffed at more than a dozen places around the course, what we saw was a race that ran like an onion. Layer after layer peeled off as the kilometers clicked by, each new layer a seeming brand-new race. The men’s UTMB race is these days becoming one of significant attrition and a race where success is largely defined by smart racing and avoiding becoming a statistic. This year was no different. The reason for this year’s attrition must in be in large part due to the weather–the extra heat and humidity–as the men’s early pace was actually a bit more controlled as compared to previous years, slower than record pace for the race’s first third. In the end, it was a race which in some ways broke all the rules and in other ways abided by them. In the end, I still find the whole thing a bit inexplicable. The men’s top five from UTMB 2016 (from left-to-right): 5. Javi Dominguez, 2. Gediminas Grinius, 1. Ludovic Pommeret, 4. David Laney, 3. Tim Tollefson. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell For 124 kilometers, AmericanZach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) led the race. He did so in the same Zach fashion we’ve seen him race 20k’s 50k’s, 50 milers, and 110k’s–unabashed rabbiting, the kid never looks back. His lead vascillated at times in that he occasionally shared it with others while at others he was quite a distance off the front. In the race’s middle third, however, his lead kept growing such that at Grand Col Ferret (102 kilometers) he had 26 minutes over the rest of the field. But his race quickly nose dived, not unlike the steep descent off the col. In the span of 22 kilometers, Zach bonked hard and gave up all 26 minutes of his lead, leaving Champex-Lac (124km) in second and a few seconds off the lead. He held pace with the leaders as long as it seems he could, but eventually his pace lapsed and he would go on to finish in a still-strong sixth place. It’s often said that high risk brings either high reward or high failure, and I’d still firmly stick his performance in the reward category. Zach finished sixth place in the world’s most competitive 100 miler for his first shot at the distance. At the finish, Zach’s eyes betrayed both deep fatigue and a deep hunger for more–I can’t help but think he’ll be back. How FrenchmanLudovic Pommeret’srace played out was something of a marvel. Ludovic started out by running at the front of the men’s race. At a half marathon into the race, he shared the lead with Zach andFabien Antolinos, who would DNF late in the race. But on the climb to the race’s marathon mark at Col du Bonhomme, Ludovic tanked, and fell back to 50th place. He suffered a low patch due to stomach problems that, as he said at the finish line, made him thinking about dropping more than once. He slowly crept back up into the top 10, but it took some 50 kilometers to do so. Even then, his battle was seemingly just beginning because he was still some 44 minutes off the lead. At Champex-Lac (124km), where most runners showed the effects of the terrain they’d already covered, Ludovic looked fresh. The game was on, and it wasn’t long before he took over the lead, broke from those desperately trying to keep contact, and built a 26-minute cushion by the finish. It seems simply not possible to win a race as competitive as this one in this style–it breaks all the rules! But those who understand this sport well know that we may not ever fully understand it. In 100 miles, anything can and does happen. Ludovic Pommeret winning the 2016 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Good grief, if I were a dude, I’m not sure I could stand the pressure of Lithuania’sGediminas Grinius(post-race interview) racing behind me. He has established his racing M.O.: conservative starts, rip-roaring finishes. And he’s one of the most internally focused racers I’ve seen, turned within and monitoring himself. Gediminus raced outside of the men’s top 10 for about the race’s first third, right around 10th place for the next third, and then he just hammered the race’s last 50 kilometers. Like Ludovic, he was something of an apparition when he moved like a steam train through Champex-Lac (124km) in fourth place. Twenty-five kilometers later, he’d passed the remaining carnage in front of him and made finishing second look like a walk in the park. When we saw him atop the last climb and descent at 160, 162, and 165 kilometers, he was simply floating. For a guy who races with such internal focus, he let it all loose at the finish, lifted a Lithuanian flag, and expressed jubilance. Gediminas Grinius taking second at UTMB 2016. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell AmericanTim Tollefson(post-race interview) debuted at 100 miles this weekend and he made doing so look really fun. I’m not going to lie, I was a little nervous for the guy when I saw him run through Saint-Gervais, the race’s half-marathon point, in something like 40th place. I expected him to take things out a little harder, and I wondered if he was feeling off. At the race’s marathon point, he was hovering just outside the men’s top 10, a situation he maintained until after the 100-kilometer mark, where he moved into the men’s top 10. For a guy who has never raced this distance, he exhibited remarkable patience and poise. From an outside perspective, it looked like Tim spent about 50 kilometers of the race’s second half lying in wait–waiting for carnage to come back. Getting onto the podium at UTMB is a bucket-list item for a lot of fast trail-ultra folks, but doing so for Tim involved passing his friend and teammate Zach Miller late in the race. These guys had made it pretty clear pre-race, though, that even if they are friends, the game would be on during the race. On the race’s final climb, Tim climbed into third place, where he would finish. And then he seemingly threw away all the patience he previously possessed, and went on like a man possessed, hunting Gediminas in second place and trying to stay in front of a chasing David Laney in fourth. Tim Tollefson striding into La Fouly (110km). Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell In taking fourth, AmericanDavid Laney(pre-race interview) put to bed anyone’s wonderings about whether the guy was a one-hit wonder here at UTMB. I felt the same way about David as I did Tim in the race’s early miles, a little nervous to see him running in 40th-some-odd place. As the race went on, however, I realized that David (and Tim for that matter) was actually running faster relative to the very front of field this year. It was actually that the men’s field was much more deep–there were more dudes than ever running within an hour of the lead at 100 kilometers. At 100 kilometers, David was in closer contact with the lead this year, it’s just that he passed much more carnage to get to the front. His late-race pushing is so fun to watch as a spectator, and it must be terrifying for the runners around him. You could see at the finish that he was spent, having given his fourth-place finish his all. Spain’sJavi Dominguezwas the men’s fifth-place finisher, and I’m not a bit surprised to see him there. His race results of late have been strong, so I expected him to contend for the men’s top 10, and I anticipated him doing so with the conservative-start/fast-finish style we saw him use to take third here three years ago. Seventh place was France’sSébastien Camus, who appeared to have several highs and lows, which would propel him in and out of the men’s top 10 throughout the race. He ultimately finished looking strong.Julien Chorier, who ran among podium position through 130 kilometers, slowed at the end to eighth. Italy’sGiulio Ornaticame on strong late to move into the top 10 in ninth, and Spain’sJuan Maria Jimenezran strong at the edge of the top 10 for much of the race. [Watch videosof the top-three men finishing.] Full results. The strategic highlight of the women’s race was the pressure France’sCaroline Chaverotand Switzerland’sAndrea Huser(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) put on each other for 170 kilometers. Caroline had run at the lead of last year’s UTMB for almost 150 kilometers before she succumbed to leg cramps. This year, believe it or not, Caroline’s race was mired by stomach issues and those same leg cramps. Though Caroline was moving well in the more than dozen times our team saw her out on the course, it appeared that she was working hard to achieve that movement. That is, it just didn’t look like the race was coming easy for her. Turns out, she suffered stomach pain on every single descent, which she said was uncomfortable and made it difficult to eat. Additionally, she was plagued by the same leg cramps as last year. It’s just that this year, she chose to push through them. Caroline’s lead over second place was never large–at it’s greatest it was something like 20 minutes. In the race’s final third, Andrea reduced her deficit by so much that Caroline caught sight of Andrea behind her, and was spurred to fight back and create a lead again. Her seven-minute gap at the finish wasn’t much, but it was plenty to crown her the 2016 UTMB champion. Caroline Chaverot floating through La Fouly (110km). Photo: iRunFar/Sergi Colome Andrea Huser’s command over races with long distances and technical terrain is incredible–the woman was as strong at the finish after finishing second as she was at the start. Andrea is a quiet presence, which from a racing perspective is incredibly dangerous. She’s like the shadow you can’t shake, always right there. While the women’s podium positions swapped quite a lot in the race’s first half marathon, Andrea settled into second place by 20 miles in and she unwaveringly maintained that position through the finish. Her time gap over the rest of the women’s field increased strongly–third place was one hour and 50 minutes back at the finish. Very clearly, Caroline and Andrea were in a category of their own at this year’s UTMB. To be honest with you, when I saw Andrea running about 14 minutes behind Caroline at Champex-Lac (124km), I thought it was game over. Andrea bounced over the rocks on the trail with a big smile, while Caroline struggled through a powerhike. So late in a race to look so good! Andrea continued from there to cut into her gap to Caroline, making it a real race for the win in the final 20 miles. With only seven minutes separating the pair at the finish, this was the closest women’s one-two finish in UTMB history. Andrea Huser staying hydrated. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sUxue Fraile(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was last year’s fastest-returning finisher, having taken second. This year, she came back with the goal of running a faster time. A strong runner over long and technical races, UTMB is really the perfect scene for her. Turns out, Uxue’s stomach went bad at about 70 kilometers into the race, and she subsequently struggled with nutrition and energy levels. Sometimes, as a race observer, you just feel bad for runners, and I sympathized with Uxue’s sufferfest–nothing came easy for her. I find it notable, however, that on a day where Uxue felt bad for 120 kilometers, she still finished a solid third place at the prestigious UTMB. Goodness, if she can run third here on a rough day, I’d sure like to see what she could do at a race like this on a perfect-for-Uxue day. Uxue Fraile enjoying Saturday’s sunrise. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sJuliette Blanchet, the U.S.’sMagda Boulet, and the U.K.’sJasmin Paris(post-race interview) took fourth, fifth, and sixth places, respectively. At 92 kilometers into the race, at Refuge Bonatti, this trio ran into these positions, and would mostly stay in them for some 80 kilometers more to the finish. There was some late-race drama, however, between Magda and Jasmin when Jasmin caught Magda on the descent to Vallorcine (151km) and Magda was forced to hammer the final climb. And hammer she did, putting about 15 minutes on Jasmin, a gap she would maintain to the finish. Magda Boulet staying calm and collected in La Fouly (110km).

2016 Ultravasan 90k Results,"The 2016Ultravasan 90k, with the replacement of 5 kilometers of dirt road with technical singletrack and rain leading up to and into the race, was set up to be slower than last year. That ended up being the case in the men’s race, but not so for the women with defending champJasmin Nunige(pre-andpost-race interviews) setting a new course record. The men’s field saw numerous lead changes withJarle Risa(post-race interview) coming home the victory. Keep reading to find out how both races played out. Thanks to theVasaloppetorganization for making our coverage of Ultravasan possible! To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The men’s race at this Ultravasan 90k was incredibly dynamic. A pack of nine men–Jonas Buud(pre-race interview),Geoff Burns(pre-race interview),Fritjof Fagerlund,Emannuel Gault,Arnaud Perrignon,Steve Way,Wouter Decock,Elov Olsson, andPatrick Reagan–sprinted past the 13-kilometer mark together and onto the race’s singletrack-trail section. The next 10+ kilometers sawRanno Eralaand Jarle Risa make up two minutes to join the pack, while it dropped Burns, Wouter, and Way two-plus minutes off the lead group. Reagan led the group into the aid station to take home the ~€500 sprint prize at Mångsbodarna (23.5 km). Jarle Risa leading with 9 kilometers to go. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By 31k, Olsson, Reagan, and Fagerlund were running off the front with Risa and Perrignon 40 seconds back. Another spot back, the reigning champ Buud was running awkwardly on an injured Achilles that would soon lead him to withdraw from the race. Arnaud Perrignon took home the second sprint prize (~€1,000) in Evertsberg with less than 30-second lead on Reagan, Fagerlund, and Risa with Olsson still within a minute of the lead. Way and Erala were the next to chase with another couple minutes back to Decock. Burns hung around in ninth with Gault in tenth ahead of dropping. Fritjof Fagerlund running in second with 9 kilometers to go. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By Oxberg at 62k, Fagerlund had taken the lead and built an 80-second cushion on second-place Risa. Reagan, Perrignon, and Way ran 3-4-5, respectively, three, four, and five minutes off the lead with Wouter just behind Way. Further back,Patrik Gustafson BjörkqvistandPatrik Wikströmhad worked there way up into ninth and tenth. Fagerlund held onto his lead through the final ~€500 sprint prize 71k in at Hökberg. However, Risa followed a mere fifteen seconds back and the writing was on the wall. Reagan continued on a few minutes back in third, while Way moved up into fourth a bit over five minutes off the lead with Decock another minute back as Perrignon fell back through the field. Ten kilometers later, Risa had a two-minute lead on Fagerlund and was flying along. Reagan and Way continued on in third and fourth with the biggest question among the top four being whether Reagan would pass Fagerlund on the way to the finish. He wouldn’t and the top four would finish in the same positions with Decock and Erala taking fifth and sixth. Patrick Reagan (in black) runs with the lead group mid-race.

Jasmin led coming off the roads at 13 kilometers before heading onto the most technical stretch of Ultravasan and never ran outside the top two the whole day. That is not to say she had an easy race at all. Sweden’s marathon phenomIsabellah Andersson–in her debut ultra–gave her a serious run for her money, exchanging the lead with her numerous times, including coming through Evertsberg at 47k in first, before eventually dropping out at the Oxberg aid station at 62km with muscle cramps.

Photo: iRunFar/Tim Peeters A few minutes off Jasmin’s pace, Seatlle’sSarah Bard(pre-andpost-race interviews) ran well throughout the race. With the lead duo obviously pushing each other she didn’t relinquish too much time, while running her own race in third for two thirds of the race. After Isabellah dropped out she consolidated her second place handily finishing in 7:07:34. Sarah Bard running in third at 47k.

It took her about 10 miles to regain her composure before she started chipping away at Sweden’sÅsa Lundin’s10-minute cushion. After finally overtaking the Sweden at Hökberg (71km), Scallon comfortably retained third finishing in 7:27:55. Cassie Scallon at 62k.

2016 Hardrock 100 Results,"For the second year in a row,Anna Frost(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won the 2016Hardrock 100women’s race. She did so with unyielding pressure off the front, despite challenging heat conditions in addition to the normal challenges of the Hardrock course. The men’s race ended in what many fans at the race suggested was perfect-for-the-Hardrock-family style, with a tie betweenKilian Jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andJason Schlarb(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). The pair dueled and worked together for some 90 miles of the race before ultimately agreeing to finish together. Kilian’s win is his third straight at Hardrock, and Jason’s win was his first. For all the details on how the race played out, read back throughour live coveragefrom race day. [If you’ve not yet checked it out, be sure to take a look at Meghan Hicks’slong-form multi-media feature on the mining history along the Hardrock course!] Special thanks forSalomonfor making our coverage of the Hardrock 100 possible!

The men’s race started inauspiciously withJason Schlarb,Kilian Jornet, andXavier Thévenard(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) running together and slower than course-record pace. As the race heated up, all three started to increase the pace to at, or below, course-record pace by Telluride, mile 27. These top-three runners were stalked by the ever-consistentJeff Browning(pre-race interview), as well asJoe Grant,Troy Howard, andNick Clark. Coming into the aid station at Ouray (mile 44), Joe Grant concussed his head going through a tunnel, and the weather had turned to become the hottest Hardrock in recent history. Xavier Thévenard, Jason Schlarb, and Kiliam Jornet on the summit of the first climb. Photo: iRunFar/Amy French As the trio of Jornet, Thévenard, and Schlarb continued to pull away at under course-record pace, the afternoon heat intensified. Stalwart veteran Browning was consistent in staying approximately 90 minutes behind the leaders. Thévenard fell back from leaders Schlarb and Jornet going up Handies Peak, the race high point and mile 63, and he remained in third place for the remainder of the race. Schlarb and Jornet continued to run together, and at the Cunningham Gulch aid station (mile 91), they agreed to run it in together for a deliberate tie. Both runners commented at the finish that they could have been dropped by the other over the last 30 miles. Xavier Thévenard leading Jason Schlarb and Kilian Jornet at mile 11. Photo: iRunFar/Marissa Harris Thévenard came into the finish 50 minutes back, stating through loose translation from French to English that Hardrock wasthemeasure of a difficult 100 miler. Jeff Browning continued to impress with his speed and consistency at age 44 in taking fourth place, three weeks after his third-place finish atWestern States, with his combined time for the two races betteringNick Clark’s previous record for the double from 2011.Ryan Kaiserrounded out the men’s top five. Many Hardrockers commented about struggling in the extreme heat, which race directorDale Garlanddescribed as the hottest year in memory. Kilian Jornet at mile 18. Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Lavender Smith Full results. For the second-consecutive year,Anna Frostwon the women’s race. Anna led from start to finish in a race where heat played a significant factor. By the time Frost reached Ouray at mile 44 and began the long ascent up the Bear Creek drainage toward Engineer Pass at mile 52, which she was “absolutely boiling” and had to slow down her pace to a walk, she had a 26-minute lead overEmma Roca(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) which would extend to 41 minutes by Maggie Gulch at mile 85. Anna maintained her composure and went on to run a clockwise time of 29:02:09 and eighth-place overall. Frost found this race much harder than her 2015 win both mentally and physically despite not being pushed in the same way by second place. This year’s clockwise-course direction, with its long and runnable downhills, didn’t play to her strengths. Her favorite part of the course was going over its high point, Handies Peak, at night with the the bright moon, stars, and coyotes howling. Anna Frost climbing Oscar’s Pass early in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Mad Moose Events Roca ran her own race for a very solid second-place finish. Emma ran in third until Chapman Gulch (mile 18) where she overtookBethany Lewis(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who took the race out hard. Roca looked controlled throughout the race, but she also looked affected by the heat in places. That said, she moved through aid stations quickly and with determination, and she never let the gap between she and Frost extend beyond 40 minutes. At Grouse Gulch (mile 58), she commented about the beauty of the course. At the finish with her family, which had crewed her through the day, night, and day again, she was emotionally charged. Emma Roca finishing second with her family. Photo: iRunFar/Tom Caughlan Lewis would eventually finish in third more than two and a half hours behind the winner as she suffered from leg cramps on the descent off Grant Swamp Pass, only the second descent of the race. Instead of chasing her own potential, she spent most of the race trying to minimize any further damage. Icing her quadriceps in Ouray, a longer break at Sherman (mile 72), a lay-down rest at Maggie Gulch, and a lot of her own willpower are how she said she managed her way back to the finish line. Fourth place was experienced Hardrocker,Darla Askew, closely followed byMeghan Hicksin fifth. Bethany Lewis running toward third place. Photo: iRunFar/Sarah Lavender Smith Full results.

2016 The North Face Lavaredo Ultra Trail Results,"[Editor’s Note:This article was written byIan CampbellandStephanie Case.] An exciting race unfolded at the 2016The North FaceLavaredo Ultra Trailwith Switzerland’sAndrea Huserdemonstrating her unwavering race strategy at this 119-kilometer distance with a deserved win in a time of 14:32:39. Great Britain’sAndy Symondsdominated the men’s race from start to finish, setting a new course record of 12:15:06 in the process. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The scene was set in the mountain town of Cortina in the Italian Dolomites, and 119 kilometers of sweet trails and beautiful vistas was on the menu. The weather in the days ahead of the race had steadily risen in temperature from the low teens to a very warm 30 degrees Celsius. But fortunately just two hours before the start, the heavens opened and relieved the heat, making it a bit more bearable. As the runners amassed at the start line, pre-race nerves and anticipation were swapped for readiness for the 11 p.m. start time. The gun went off and the runners charged down the paved streets of Cortina with a large crowd cheering them all the way. It was sign of things to come as the pace never even settled; it was frenetic from the start and it didn’t cease. By the time they had reached Ospitale at 18k, race winner Symonds was in the top three and only two minutes off the course-record pace set by last year’s winnerDidrik Hermansen, and it was only to get better as the race progressed.Scott HawkerandPau Capellwere also in the top six, a position they were to hold throughout the race.

Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell By the time the field reached Federavecchia at 33k, Symonds was a clear front leader and starting to make ground on the course record. LithuanianGediminas Griniushad slowly moved up and was in fourth and by Refugio Auronzo at 48k he was in second place just seconds ahead ofSylvain Courtof France. Symonds’s lead was four minutes at this stage and incredibly he kept increasing this lead with a dominant display of running, dipping under course-record pace by a full 10 minutes from Cimabanche (67k) onward. Grinius worked hard in the latter stages to minimize the deficit, eventually finishing eight minutes behind the winner and also under the old course record. Gediminas Grinius after finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell The surprise of the day was the performance of Spain’sJavi Dominguez; at 33k he was not even in the top 10, moving to seventh at Malga Ra Stua (75k). His progression to a third-place podium spot was phenomenal as he was five minutes behind Hawker and Capell at Malga Ra Stua and when they had reached Passo Giau (102k) he had taken third spot, passing Hawker, Capell, and Court.

Rory Bosiotook an early lead, passing first through Uberto at 16k withFederica Boifavajust one minute behind and Andrea on their tails. Rory maintained the lead through Federavecchia at 33k, followed closely by Andrea with Federica,Uxue FraileandLisa Borzanicoming in closely five minutes later. While starting strong, local favouriteFrancesca Canepadropped out early on. Federica would also not finish. By the time the field reached Auronzo at 48k, Andrea, unfazed by the muddy conditions on the trail, had established a six-minute lead ahead of Lisa in second with Uxue following just a minute later. Rory arrived 25 minutes later in fourth, visibly struggling and nauseous. While Rory attempted to refuel and rest with her legs up on the wall,Fernanda Maciel,who had been running just outside of and then inside the top five for the race’s first third, was in and out of the checkpoint quickly, showing a level of energy and strength that would only continue throughout the race.

Andrea blew through the checkpoint having widened her lead, and Uxue and Lisa arrived 30 seconds apart 13 minutes later. Fernanda andCristiana Folladorbreezed through in fourth and fifth place, 22 and 36 minutes off the lead respectively, withMarie McNaughton, then in eighth, starting to climb her way up the pack.

Photo: iRunFar/Stephanie Case At Col Gallina (95k), there was little doubt that Andrea would go on to win the race, arriving a full 30 minutes ahead of the next female runner. Attention then turned to the close competition between Fernanda and Uxue in second and third places, just one minute apart from each other. The sense of determination from both women was palpable as they quickly refueled with little words spoken. Cristiana arrived less than 20 minutes later with Marie on her heels, having jumped ahead ofSophie GrantandYulia Baykova. Lisa, struggling with a previous leg injury, had dropped back to 14th place by 95k, eventually pulling out, along withDenise Zimmermann. Rory, displaying true grit, arrived alongside Mike Foote, who were both reduced to walking at that point and ended up finishing together.Lizzy Hawker, crewed by Nepalese runnerMira Rai, shared a laugh with her teammates before heading off at a strong pace in 12th place, eventually working her way up to a top-10 finish. Andrea finished the race in 14:32, a full 41 minutes ahead of Uxue in second. Fernanda, Cristiana, and Marie rounded out the top five, with smiles of relief at the finish line all around.

2016 Western States 100 Results,"Amidst a day of constant race lead changes and shake-ups,Andrew MillerandKaci Lickteigused winning combinations of brains and brawn to win the 2016Western States 100.

Thanks also toInov-8for their support of our Western States coverage. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. At just 20 years of age but with incredible maturity developed through six previous years of ultrarunning,Andrew Miller(post-race interview) ran the early miles not even close to the front of the pack. When we saw him the first time at mile 16, he was running in 10th place. Each time we encountered him after that, he had moved up another place or, at the least, stayed steady where he was. At Michigan Bluff, just past halfway, he moved into podium position. By the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78, he was second. Andrew Miller in second across the American River. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell In one of the most unusual storylines we’ve seen in quite some time in trail running, when almost-all-day leaderJim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) went off course and slowed way down, Andrew assumed the race lead with 6.5 miles to go, rolling across the finish line looking just about as shocked with his win as his fans were. Whatever under-the-radar status Andrew Miller retained going into the race, it’s now long gone. It took grace, wisdom, and fitness to win this year’s race, and Andrew possessed more of those qualities at this race than the rest of the field. Second place, Norway’sDidrik Hermansen(post-race interview), may not be well known to American trail running fans, but he has well-established presence on the Euro ultra scene and is known for his leg speed. However, for Didrik, 100 miles was an unknown quantity as he’d not yet successfully finished the distance. Didrik ran in the men’s top 10 all day, looking wicked comfortable in the back half of it early and still good if a little hot in the 95-degree-Fahrenheit afternoon temperatures in the front half later on. At mile 93.5, he’d assumed second place and closed strong from there. Didrik Hermansen enjoying the sauna that is the climb to Michigan Bluff. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Third place wasJeff Browning(post-race interview). What? The guy was barely inside the top 20 when we first saw him 16 miles into the race. No beans about it, the dude knows how to race 100 miles. Into the top 10 about a third of the way through the race, into the top five by mile 85, and then the podium at mile 93.5. Jeff now has a couple dozen 100-mile finishes and is a true master of the second halves of races. I think we’d all like to take that chapter from Jeff’s 100-mile racing book. Jeff Browning crossing the American River. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sThomas Lorblanchet(pre-race interview) came into this race wearing bib M5 and it seemed like almost every time we saw him today he was also in fifth place. Look up the definition of ‘consistent’ in the dictionary and you’ll surely find Thomas at Western States. He’s a quiet, focused racer so it’s hard to get a read on how he’s feeling except for through how he’s moving. And his legs deceived neither us nor him today–he was surefooted from start to finish. Rounding out the men’s top five was Scottish speedsterPaul Giblin. Another established presence on the Euro ultra scene, Paul also has a penchant for occasionally training and racing in the U.S. Paul looked strong early and late, but honestly a bit choppy in the race’s middle third. However, two out of three thirds ain’t bad and neither is fifth place at Western States. Jim Walmsley created quite a stir for some 93.5 miles of racing wherein he led the race basically unchallenged and challenging the 14:46:44 course record set four years ago byTimothy Olson. His effort seemed inhuman–and truly asking all of us observing at aid stations to plausibly reset the definitions of what is possible. None of us knew what to make of a guy who put himself 32 minutes ahead of the course record at the river crossing at mile 78. Unfortunately, before mile 93.5, he took a wrong turn and went several miles off course before turning around, returning to the course, and basically walking it in. And never mind the incident at the river crossing before thatwherein he was briefly swept downstreamfrom the monitored crossing as he swum across the river. In the weeks before the race, it was said many times that Jim was going to create fireworks with however his day turned out and that was never a truer statement. Another race favorite,Sage Canaday(pre-race interview), took things out pretty hard. Observing his run, he seemed somewhat torn by the dueling ideas that 100 miles is a long race and that Jim was running quite strongly ahead of him. Through the race’s middle third, Sage, too, was ahead of record pace, but by fewer minutes. By the river, his stomach had stopped working. Like Jim, Sage finished, but looked a bit worse for the wear when it was all over. Likewise, the early third-place runnerDavid Laney(pre-race interview) faded hard but finished. Full results. Andrew Miller winning the 2016 Western States 100. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Kaci Lickteig(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was a real sight to behold, light and airy in body posture and spirit from start to finish. It seems that this just was her year to win Western States. With defending championMagda Boulet(pre-race interview) quickly eliminated from the competition when she dropped with stomach issues at mile 16, Kaci was the relatively unchallenged race leader all day. Mile 16, mile 23, mile 30, mile 38, mile 47, mile 55, mile 62, mile 70, mile 78, mile 80, mile 85, mile 94, mile 97, mile 99, and the finish—get the picture?—these were all the places we saw Kaci on course and we found her to be categorically smiles, hugs, happiness, and joy each of those times. We’ve seen her race here several times before, and those times we witnessed her working through clear low patches and difficulties. This race seemed different, however, with almost no blips on her radar. Her seemingly seamless race certainly showed that stars do sometimes totally align for a single race, a single experience. Kaci’s 17:57:59 is the fourth-fastest time on the course—only times run by women namedAnn TrasonorEllie Greenwoodhave been faster. Her finish also represents another marked improvement on her two previous finishes: a sixth in 20:07 in 2014 and second last year in 19:20. With such improvement each year, I don’t know that we’ve seen close to the extent of Kaci’s potential here. Kaci Lickteig crossing the American River in the lead. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Second-placeAmy Sproston(post-race interview), now here’s a person who is unpredicatable via observation. I seriously have no idea how Amy is really feeling based upon how she looks. Fortunately, if you ask her how she’s doing, she’s generally totally honest with wherever she’s at. Though whether she’s feeling good or bad, she is always incredibly focused on the tasks at hand, and today was no exception. Amy took it relatively easy before pushing later in the race, especially when she found herself pressured from behind by third place Devon Yanko. In the race’s final miles, Devon temporarily closed the gap to Amy, but this clearly spurred Amy on and she, in turn, pushed and put a goodly number of minutes back on Devon. At the finish, Amy cited Devon as part of her inspiration for her strong finish. With several finishes in this race and her highest previously having been third place and some 30-ish minutes slower, let’s just say that when this woman is on, it’s on. And today it was on. Amy Sproston cruising through Robinson Flat. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Devon Yanko(post-race interview) was the third woman. After looking chill early, I think she almost gave up on her race in the miles before Dusty Corners at mile 38 after missing her crew at an aid station, running out of supplies, and experiencing cramping. At mile 38, things seemed enough amiss that we wondered if she’d be able to recover and remain in the race. Fortunately, she sussed out her issues by spending a bit of extra time at a couple aid stations, regrouping, and running the second half of the race with a smile on her face and some spring in her step. Her podium finish is a living, breathing example of the fact that 100 miles is a long way, and there’s a lot of time for things to go both bad and good. Devon Yanko smiling her way through Robinson Flat. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Amanda Bashamwas one of my favorite performances in the women’s race. We’ve previously watched her race a couple times, at two The North Face Endurance Challenge 50-Mile Championships races where she hovered on the cusp of top-10 women’s finishes. Here, Amanda spent the first part of the race hanging out in right about the same spot, just inside and outside of the women’s top 10. We saw her a few times in the race’s two thirds, and each time she was super chill, no fuss, and no pressure. After the halfway point at Michigan Bluff (mile 55.7), that’s when she crept into the top 10 and stayed there for good. From there, she slowly but steadily crept up on the rest of the field, picking off places until she full on lambasted the race’s final 10 miles or so. In this, her first 100-mile finish, as we understand it, she showed the world that she has the combination of street smarts and fitness to hang with the big guns at the 100-mile distance. Canada’sAlissa St. Laurentrounded out the women’s top five and brought a little international flare to the women’s race. At every aid station we visited, and though her position jumped around here and there, Alissa was consistently within the top 10 and she consistently looked confident in her pace and position. Her 20:27 fifth place improves upon her first finish here in 2014, where she finished 13th in 22:17. Something tells me that there is a lot of potential remaining with Alissa’s efforts at Western States. Alissa St Laurent running through Robinson Flat.

2016 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Results,"On a classicZegama-Aizkorri Marathonday, with countless hours of rain, tons of mud, and freezing cold weather,Kilian Jornet(pre-race interview) and Norwegian rising trail starYngvild Kaspersenwon the 15thedition of the marathon, the second “Sky” race in this year’s Skyrunner World Series. The start of the 2016 Zegama Marathon. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Some fast ladies lined up for this year’s Zegama Marathon. Leading the names was last year’s champion,Azara Garcia, who had a great season and began this year with a win on Spain’s Ultra Championships. From the very beginning, Garcia took off and opened up a three minute lean onthe chase group by the 9-kilometer mark. AmericanMegan Kimmelwas second at this point, withOihana KortazarandRagna Debatsrunning in third and fourth just a minute behind her. Young gunYngvild Kaspersenwho was making her marathon debut, kept things easy showing up here in fifth. Azara Garcia leading 10k into Zegama. Photo: iRunFar Halfway into the race, Garcia was still leading, running strong, and pushing a hard pace to repeat her win from last year. But her lead wasn’t big anymore, with Kimmel arriving to this point just a minute after her. Kortazar kept doing her own thing and passed through this point in third, alone. Two minutes behind her were Debats and Kaspersen taking things easier than the rest. The big show started after this point. Megan Kimmel cruising 10k into the race. Photo: iRunFar After losing a bunch of time on the big uphill to Aizkorri and the ridgeline to Aitxuri, Garcia finally dropped at Urbia, 28k into the race with Kimmel taking over the lead there. However, Kaspersen took advantage of the Norwegian-like weather and moved from fifth to first at the top of Andraitz, 30k into the race. From there to the finish line, she controlled the race and finished winning in 4:50:58. Kimmel completed a great comeback to Zegama after her 2010 race, and finished in second in 4:59:46. Kortazar had a strong race to the finish, repeating her last year position, finishing third with a time of 5:06:37. Close to Kortazar after an amazing downhill was Catalunya’sMarta Molistin 5:07:41. After sixth months out of the scene due to a stress fracture,Maite Maioracame back in her home race to finish in a happy fifth place to start the season in 5:18:59.

Same story as the men’s race, lots of women retired today due to bad weather, such asAzara Garcia,Ragna DebatsandGemma Arenas. 2016 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Women’s Results This year’s men’s race at Zegama played out much differently than last year. While weather is usually a key factor at the race, this many athletes withdrew from the race with hypothermia. Top Basque runner last year,Aritz Egea, used his well-known strategy of going out fast and breaking up the lead pack.Kilian Jornetfollowed him close, opening a gap of around a minute to the chase group that includedHassan Ait Chaou,Luis Alberto Hernando, andManuel Merillas. A second chase group lead by SwissMarc Lauensteinwas running fast to catch up, around 1:30 behind the leaders, and includingTom Owens,Tadei Pivk, andJessed Hernandez. Aritz Egea leading Kilian Jornet 10k into Zegama. Photo: iRunFar Things started to change in Sancti Spiritu, halfway into the race, with Lauenstein leading Jornet in a strong pace after the first big climb. Egea dropped to third, followed close by Hernando and Pivk. At top of Aizkorri, Kilian Jornet took the lead to finish winning calmly with a 10-minute gap on the runner-up in 3:50:03. There’s not much to say about Kilian’s win other than he completely dominated the situation and that when the weather got worst on the ridge from Aizkorri to Aitxuri he was stronger than the rest of the field. Kilian cruising into Sancti Spiritu. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Former orienteering world champion Marc Lauenstein from Switzerland was one of the dark horses today, despite not being a downhill specialist, he managed to keep the pace for second place from Andraitz at 30k to finish line in 3:59:22. Third to fifth were Hernando in 4:00:05, Merillas in 4:00:32, and Pivk in 4:01:57, separated by less than two minutes. Hernando, whowon Transvulcania just two weeks ago, made a huge effort to complete the podium, while last year’s second- and first-place runners did a great job in this freezing year jumping into top five. I would like to add that these three were running together before the last downhill, at the 30k mark, where Hernando used his downhill abilities to escape from his chasers.

2016 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results,"While no course records were set at this weekend’sTransvulcania Ultramarathonon the La Palma in Spain’s Canary Islands, the race had more than its fair share of fast times. How? Tight spacing within both top 10s, with the women’s race being much tighter than in recent years. Still, neither winner needed to sprint over the final kilometers as the now-three-time-champLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won by five minutes and surprise women’s champIda Nilsson(post-race interview) of Sweden won by more than 15 minutes. In taking their wins, both take early leads in the Skyrunner World Series Ultra category. Read on for more details about this year’s Transvulcania! In his pre-race interview,Sylvain Courtcalled La Palma Luis Alberto Hernando’s garden. Well, Luis certainly looked like he reaped what he’d sown out there. While he appeared to already be working hard 20 kilometers into the race, he ran virtually the same race he has the past two years. He hung out a few minutes off the lead before building an insurmountable lead on the 8,000-foot descent from El Roque de los Muchachos to the sea. Luis Alberto Hernando running before El Pilar. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The last man Luis Alberto had to pass en route to his win wasSage Canaday(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Sage seemed to replay his previous two efforts on La Palma in 2013 and 2014. He set the pace in the early-to-middle parts of the race, putting his climbing skills to good use, in seeming hopes he’d build enough of a lead to hold it on the descent. While he was actually caught prior to the race’s high point in his previous two runnings, Sage had a minute in hand on Hernando, but that quickly vanished on the descent. Sage Canaday leading before El Pilar. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Nicolas Martin(post-race interview) looked awesome all day. He was running toward the front throughout the race and he put on a massive surge on the huge descent to pass Sage and move from third to second, which is where he’d finish. A third of the way into the race,Andy Symondswas just outside of the top 10. From there on, he’d move up all the way to fourth by the finish line. If there was any question as to whether the old Andy Symonds is back… we now know he is. Speaking of being back,Chris Vargolooked strong and comfortable all day on his way to placing fifth. Consider the challenges of 2015 behind you, Vargo. Remigio Huamánlived up to the expectations of his South American supporters. He took things out fairly hard, dropped back a bit mid-race, and surged to the finish to take seventh. Full results. Sweden’sIda Nilsson(post-race interview) dominated from the start and had minutes of lead by 22 kilometers. While one might naturally wonder whether a relatively unknown runner could hold a 10-minute lead in the second half of an eight-hour race with such strong competition, Ida showed she could. She even steadily increased her lead at the race went on. Ida Nilsson after winning the 2016 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks France’sAnne-Lise Rousset(post-race interview) went out in second, but with a reputation for going out hard, perhaps too hard at times, it wasn’t clear if she’d hold her place. But that she did, even asRuth Croft(post-race interview) charged on the race’s massive descent. Rousset was clearly emotional about finishing second at the finish line–an outstanding showing in an international field for her. Anne-Lise Rousset running at El Reventon. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Now, Croft was top five for most of the race before moving up late. Indeed, from afar it looked as if she might catch Rousset before the race’s final climb up to the finish in Los Llanos, but it wasn’t to be. Even so, a podium spot here adds to her growing list of international street cred. Ruth Croft running earlier in the race before El Pilar on her way to taking third. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Seemingly sitting in fourth all day was AmericanAlicia Shay. Coincidentally, that’s exactly where she finished at least year’s Transvulcania. While that might seem anti-climactic, Alicia dealt with some serious health issues between the two races, so her fourth-place finish must seem like an encouraging return to form. What’s more, Shay ran nearly half an hour faster this year! Fellow AmericanHillary Allenhad a great race, sitting in the back half of the top 10 in the first half and moving up in the second half.

Aunque no hubo records de circuito este fin de semana en laUltramaratón Transvulcaniaen La Palma, dentro de las Islas Canarias Españolas, la carrera tuvo mucho más que sólo tiempos rápidos. Poca diferencia entre ambos top 10s, con las carrera de las chicas siendo más apretada que en los últimos años. Aun así, ninguno de los dos ganadores tuvo que sprintar en los últimos kilómetros, ya que el (ahora) triple campeónLuis Alberto Hernando(entrevistaspre-carreraypost-carrera) triunfó por cinco minutos, y la sorpresiva campeona entre las mujeresIda Nilsson(entravista post-carrera) de Suecia, ganó por más de 15 minutos. ¡Continua leyendo para más detalles de la Transvulcania de este año! En su entrevista previa,Sylvain Courtllamó a La Palma como el patio trasero de Luis Alberto Hernando. Bueno, parece que Luis cosechó lo que sembró allí. Parecía ir exigido y haber empujado mucho con 20 kilómetros de carrera, pero virtualmente corrió la misma carrera de los últimos dos años. Se mantuvo unos minutos atrás de los líderes antes de conseguir una irremontable ventaja sobre los demás en los 2500 metros negativos desde El Roque de los Muchachos al mar. Luis Alberto Hernando corriendo justo antes de El Pilar. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks El último hombre al que Luis Alberto tuvo que sobrepasar en el camino hacia su triunfo fueSage Canaday(entrevistaspre-carreraypost-carrera). Parecería que Sage repitió su estrategia de sus dos actuaciones aquí en La Palma, en 2013 y 2014. Marcó el ritmo desde el principio hasta la mitad de la carrera, haciendo buen uso de sus habilidades para subir, esperando crear una buena diferencia para llegar holgado a la bajada. En sus dos participaciones previas en la carrera, lo había pillado en la parte alta del circuito, este año llegó con un minuto de ventaja sobre Hernando, la cual se desvaneció rápidamente en el descenso. Sage Canaday liderando antes de El Pilar. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks ANicolas Martin(entrevista post-carrera) se lo vio bien durante todo el día. Siempre se mantuvo corriendo adelante, y recuperó de manera impresionante en la bajada para pasar a Sage y así moverse del tercero al segundo puesto, su puesto final. Andy Symondsse mantuvo fuera del top 10 por casi un tercio de carrera. Desde allí, fue adelantando puestos hasta quedar cuarto en meta. Si quedaba alguna duda sobre si el viejo Andy Symonds estaba de regreso…sabemos que lo está. Hablando de estar de regreso,Chris Vargose vio fuerte y confortable durante todo el día rumbo a su quinto puesto. Considera los desafíos que tuviste en el 2015 y que quedaron atrás, Vargo. Remigio Huamánrevivio las expectativas de sus seguidores Sudamericanos. Salió muy fuerte, se descolgó un poco del grupo a mitad de camino, y resurgió al final para terminar séptimo. Full results. La SuecaIda Nilsson(entravista post-carrera) domino desde el principio llegando al kilómetro 22 ya con varios minutos de ventaja. Mientras que cualquiera puede, naturalmente, preguntarse cuánto puede una corredora prácticamente desconocida sostener una diferencia de 10 minutos en la segunda mitad de una carrera de ocho horas con tal nivel de competidoras, Ida demostró que ella puede hacerlo. Incluso, aumentó la diferencia a medida que transcurría la carrera. Ida Nilsson tras ganar la Ultramaratón Transvulcania 2016. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Desde Francia,Anne-Lise Rousset(entrevista post-carrera) fue segunda desde el principio, pero con su fama de salir fuerte, quizás muy fuerte a veces, no estábamos seguros de que fuera a poder mantener su puesto. Pero lo logró, incluso conRuth Croft(entrevista post-carrera) apretando en el gran descenso. Rousset se mostró muy emocionada de acabar segunda en meta, una performance espectacular en un lote internacional como este para ella. Anne-Lise Rousset, en carrera, en El Reventón. Foto: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Croft se mantuvo entre las cinco primeras durante casi toda la carrera, moviéndose hacia adelante en el final. De hecho, desde afuera parecía que iba a pillar a Rousset antes de la subida final hacia Los Llanos, pero eso no sucedió. De cualquier manera, el podio aquí se suma a su creciente lista de créditos internacionales. Ruth Croft corriendo en los primeros kilómetros de carrera, en El Pilar, rumbo a su tercer puesto. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Durante todo el día, la EstadounidenseAlicia Shayse mantuvo en el cuarto lugar. Casualmente, ese es el mismo puesto que obtuvo en la Transvulcania del año anterior. Aunque esto no parezca gran cosa, Alicia tuvo que lidiar con serios problemas de salud entre ambas carreras, así que creo que su cuarta posición puede haber sido un gran retorno a su buena forma. Y además, ¡Shay corrió casi media hora más rápido este año! La colega EstadounidenseHillary Allentuvo una gran carrera, manteniéndose en la segunda mitad del top 10 al principio, y subiendo puestos hacia el final de la carrera. Full results.

2016 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results,"This weekend, in rainy and cool conditions and on the hills above California’s Lake Sonoma,Jim Walmsley(post-race interview) andYiOu Wang(post-race interview) championed the 2016Lake Sonoma 50 Mile.

As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Thank you so much toNathanfor their generous support of our coverage of this year’s Lake Sonoma 50 Mile. Thanks also toJulbofor making our coverage of Lake Sonoma possible. There’s a certain set of people in the trail-ultrarunning scene who call races like this one ‘track meets.’ Long races, sure, but ones where leg speed becomes one of the major deciding factors as to who is going to win a race because of runnable terrain. It’s true that, each year, the Lake Sonoma men’s race may, indeed, come resemble a track meet a little bit more. That said, given the inherent leg speed of a half dozen dudes on the start line, this year’s men’s race went out certifiably chill. Mario Mendozacruised the 2.4 miles of hilly roads that start Lake Sonoma off ahead of the main men’s pack, but he was sucked back into the group after they hit singletrack. At the mile 11.6 Warm Springs Creek crossing, it wasJim Walmsley(post-race interview) who had broken off the front of the group by a half minute and taken a lead he’d never relinquish. Even so, his pace was minutes more tempered this year than in 2015 when he crossed this creek on his way to fifth place. In what felt like a strange turn of events for Lake Sonoma–a race where a new course record has been set in the men’s race every single year of its existence–Jim and the rest of the boys ran a pace that seemed, ahem… slow? Yeah, but slow it wasn’t. The better descriptor is perhaps ‘controlled.’ The miles clicked on, and Jim increased his lead over the group: 30 seconds at mile 11.6, two minutes at mile 16.9, five minutes at mile 25.2, and on up to 17-some-odd minutes at the finish where he set a new course record by about 8.5 minutes. Running in a category of his own this weekend, Jim is proving himself a force to be contended with right now. For those keeping track, Jim already had a Golden Ticket from winning January’sBandera 100k, so his ticket rolls down the men’s podium. Jim Walmsley, 2016 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile champion.

A standout high school and collegiate track and cross-country runner and a friend of Jim’s who decided to give ultrarunning a go. It was hard not to be intrigued by story of a guy running boldy in what I was sure was his first ultra. And, it’s hard not to be intrigued by the fact that he ran 50 miles just fine–in fact, better than fine–took second, and earned a Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Together Tim and eventual fourth-place finisherDylan Bowmanran for some miles, coming through miles 16.9 and 19.5 pretty close together before Tim broke away from Dylan around the halfway point and maintained his second position all the way back around the lake. As to whether or not Tim will take that Golden Ticket? As of this publishing, he’s not yet decided. Tim Freriks 30 miles into his first ultra and on his way to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks I thinkMario Mendoza(post-race interview) is a guy who could kick the pants off a course like Lake Sonoma, if he can get all the variables to line up right on race day. In this year’s edition, Mario ran the early miles of the race along with the main men’s lead pack before assuming around fourth to fifth position for a good chunk of the race. At mile 38, for example, Mario was in fourth and a full three minutes off of third. However, by mile 45.5, Mario had passed Dylan and put a minute on him, moving himself into third place. As we learned post-race, that pair’s battle wasn’t over there, though. Dylan would surge and pass Mario once in the final miles before Mario kicked, passed Dylan back, and nabbed the last podium spot and the second Golden Ticket. Do we know if Mario will race Western States? I don’t think he’s an official yes yet, but he sounded eager about it on the finish line. Mario Mendoza headed toward third place.

Similar toThe North Face Endurance Challenge 50-Mile Championshipslast December, we didn’t see much carnage in the men’s race. Most of the dudes who were in or very near the top 10 at 20 miles in were the same guys in or near the top 10 at the finish. I can’t help but wonder if we’re starting to see a new trend in trail ultrarunning? Also, I can’t help but note Walmsley’s pacing strategy–slower than record pace early, hover at record pace midway, and close a bunch faster–in contrast to theZach Millerpacing strategy–all out all the way. Pairing these two fellas’ and their approaches in a single race would make for some entertaining running right about now. Full results. For all the energy conversation present in the early men’s race, there was none of that at the very front of the women’s race.Camille Herron, a road runner who converted a year ago to road ultrarunning with great success, made her trail-ultra debut here at Sonoma. She went out hard, real hard. In fact, she was not far back from the lead men at mile 2.4 and still less than a half-dozen minutes behind at mile 11.6. No other woman bit on chasing Camille, however, and the rest of the women’s lead pack bunched up mostly together and worked the south side of Lake Sonoma in the early miles. Camille’s pace was ultimately unsustainable, however. After building up a lead on the other women through about mile 20, she gave that time back in the next 10 miles, lost the lead, kept going, and ultimately finished fourth looking real rough before beer and a seat at the finish line quickly revived her. YiOu Wang(post-race interview), a NorCal standout runner in shorter-distance trail racing, served as Camille’s closest chaser, but not aggressively so. At mile 11.6, for example, she was some six minutes behind Camille and running basically at course-record pace, but she was already emerging from the rest of the top women as the gal to beat as she was 1.5 minutes up on everyone else. While YiOu never built a huge lead on the passel of fast ladies behind her, she stayed steady and a couple minutes ahead of them all the way. Between miles 25 and 30, she assumed the lead position, held it through the finish, and came over the line beaming with joy. I suspect this victory is only beginning a long string of success for YiOu. YiOu was offered a Western States Golden Ticket with her win, and she said she’d think about it for a little while.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Kaci Lickteig(post-race interview) ran a smart and spirited race from start to finish, and you’d never guess that she’d only had five weeks of training following a winter bout with injury ahead of this race. Early, she ran among the main pack of women who would stay closely bunched for most of the race’s first half before stringing out into podium position. When we saw her on a hill at mile 30, she was almost skipping up the darn thing and only five minutes off leader YiOu. Fans watching couldn’t help but wonder if she’d come out this race the victor. We’d see her two more times before the finish, at miles 38 and 45.5, and she was almost identically attitude-ed. Between miles 30 and 38, she assumed second position, but she never dug into the three- to four-minute lead YiOu had on her. She crossed the finish looking absolutely elated with second place. Kaci’s already got entrance to Western States via her second place there in 2015, so her Golden Ticket rolls down. Kaci Lickteig says hi to her family at mile 19.5. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Anna Mae Flynn(post-race interview) was this weekend’s surprise fast female finisher, in her first 50 miler and on flatter terrain than she’d previously raced in her less-than-a-year career in trail ultrarunning. For the race’s first half, Anna Mae sat right there among the main group of top women, which ran together for some miles before very gradually spreading out a little, in fifth position each time we saw her until mile 30, where she’d moved up to fourth. She would hold fourth until the race’s final mile, when on the rocky uphill to the finish she came upon a suffering Camille. Anna Mae passed, ran home to the final podium spot, and earned a Western States Golden Ticket. She, too, is still undecided as of this publishing whether she would take it, but she was leaning toward accepting. Anna Mae Flynn working the hill at mile 30.

2016 Marathon Des Sables Results,"The 31stMarathon des Sables(MdS) began the morning of Sunday, April 10 in the Moroccan Sahara with more than 1,100 participants toeing the line. For those unfamiliar, the MdS is a seven-day, six-stage race (only the first five stages count toward the rankings this year) in which competitors carry all their own supplies except for a daily water ration and a shade tent to sleep under… which they share with seven other competitors. At the conclusion of Stage 5, Morocco’sRachid El Morabitybecame the winner for the fourth time and Russia’sNatalia Sedykhwon her first MdS. As in past years, we have shared results and commentary–including updates from the field–after each stage.

Stage 5 Field Report from Jacqueline Kantor There was one podium spot close enough to shake up on the fifth stage of the 2016 edition: the battle for men’s third place between Spain’sChema Martinezand Morocco’sAziz El Akad. In today’s fifth stage, El Akad hung with race frontrunnerRachid El MorabityandAbdelkader El Mouazizto finish about 28 minutes ahead of Martinez and jump into the third spot. If provisional results stand, this year’s podium should be an identical repeat of last year’s: El Morabity (21:01.21), El Mouaziz (21:05.38), and El Akad (22:07.30). The stage’s and overall race’s podium (left to right with overall placings): 3rd. Aziz El Akad, 1st. Rachid El Morabity, 2nd. Abdelkader El Mouaziz. Photo: Cimbaly MdS 2016 Martinez had led El Akad by seven minutes and 30 seconds after the long stage. El Akad hung with his teammates throughout the marathon stage to extend the gap—“after the long stage, I had no choice,” he said. “I had to put all of my energy into this stage.” El Morabity’s fourth MdS win puts him one victory away from the legendaryMohamad Ahansal’srecord. He jumped over the finish line with his fist in the air, and moments after,  he was already talking about exceeding Ahansal’s five wins in the next few years. The plan was to start with a strong rhythm, he said, and help keep El Akad at a pace that Martinez could not follow. The Moroccan top finishers, joined by teammateSamir Akhdar, rushed into a crowd of local staff and drivers waiting beyond the finish, and began chanting a Berber song and drumming on half-empty water bottles. Just beyond the finish, competitors from the first wave of runners screamed as they crossed the finish and posed in front of the live webcam with arms raised, hitting their hearts with their hands and blowing kisses at the camera. Less than an hour after the finish, Martinez expressed concerns that a checkpoint stop had delayed his race. He finished sixth overall with a time of 3:39.20, and five minutes were deducted from his finish time to make up for the time lost on the course, which will not change his overall standing. Natalia Sedykhfinished in a time of approximately3:45and sprinted through the finish line shouting, “yes! yes!” “It was a very fun race, a dangerous race, but I am alive,” she said. “I am happy.” Natalia Sedykh winning Stage 5 and the 2016 Marathon des Sables. Photo: Cimbaly MdS 2016 Nathalie Mauclairfinished some 22minutes laterinsecondthird place.Wyan Chowstarted in the early wave today, ran incredibly well, and ran the second-fastest time for the women in Stage 5.

[Editor’s Note:It looks like Jason finished as 11th man in the overall rankings.] He had not worn a substantial pack while running before this race, and did not do any heat acclimatization leading up to the race. “This has been a miserable challenge, a misery train, but a life experience,” he said. “Today was the easiest day for me. I’ve accomplished it, and I’m happy.” [Editor’s Note:Meghan Arbogastfinished 13th on the day to hold her spot as 10th women overall and finish top American women.] Stage 5 Competition Analysis [Editor’s Note:The competition analyses in this article have been written by iRunFar Senior EditorMeghan Hicks, who is not racing MdS this year but who has finished the MdS five times.] Another year of the MdS comes and goes with the completion of Stage 5! At this point, we’ve analyzed this race through and through, so there isn’t too much left to say, except that it’s our turn to go quiet and let the runners emerge from the desert–after one more night sleeping with in their tents and living in self-sufficiency and a non-competitive, charity Stage 6, which takes place on Saturday–and tell each of their stories. Without a doubt and with his fourth MdS win,Rachid El Morabitycements himself into history alongside the two Moroccan legends of the race, brothersLahcen and Mohamad Ahansal, who historically have dominated the winner’s spot of this race. It is perhaps fitting, as Rachid comes from the same town as Lahcen and Mohamad, a small town at the edge of the Sahara called Zagora, and trained under Mohamad for quite some time. They grow them wicked fast out there in the desert, don’t they? An amazing part of Rachid’s story that we can’t forget is his 2012 race, where he broke his femur during Stage 4 while leading the race, was medivac-ed out of the race’s remote location, and underwent major surgery. To return from that sort of major injury and enter back into competitive dominance as he has makes Rachid’s a double Cinderella story. Another competitive note on the women’s race,Natalia SedykhandNathalie Mauclairput on quite a show over the course of the race and showed what’s possible for women at the MdS. That said, they were just two members of a highly competitive women’s field, more competitive than any other MdS edition, I’d have to venture a guess. In true MdS style, the unique and difficult racing and living conditions roughed up some of the race favorites, taking them out of contention by the end of the week. But also in true MdS style, a few new faces emerged from the fray, women who managed to sort through those challenges and come out of them a bit faster than their competition. A new day dawns on women’s MdS competition with the 2016 edition. In addtion to what Natalia and Nathalie did at the front of the race in terms of pushing boundaries, MoroccanAziza Rajiwas her own sort of boundary pusher thisweek. Though this is changing, Moroccan social norms for women don’t generally include sports except in minority situations, and the MdS has seen only a handful of Moroccan women participate in the race’s 31-year history. With Aziza’s fifth place, she’ll certainly return to the rest of her life a role model for her female countrymates. Men’s Stage 5 Results Full stage and overall results.

While the course interspersed with sand dunes here and there, a jebel, and a couple other pace-sucking elements, this year’s Stage 5 marathon course appears to have followed suit with MdS tradition: a perfect marathon and ‘easy,’ runnable terrain–at least in the context of the Sahara Desert and what runners have seen over the course of the week.

Stage 4 Field Report from iRunFar Correspondent [Editor’s Note:The field reports in this article have been written by iRunFar field correspondentJacqueline Kantor.] Update April 14 10 am US Mountain Time: Runners continued to trail in throughout the early morning of the fifth day in the desert, Thursday, as top finishers, who had made their way back after sunset last night, enjoyed a day off before the marathon stage. There’s a 35-hour time limit on the 84.3-kilometer long stage, which ends on Thursday evening. The men’s race is poised to turn out with the same top two finishers as 2015, andRachid El Morabityshould take another title unlessAbdelkader El Mouaziz, who trails by four minutes and 26 seconds, is able to push past his younger teammate. Rachid El Morabity running into the sunset and his win of Stage 4. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 After each finish,Jose Manuel ‘Chema’ Martinezrepeatedly talks of how he cannot catch the Moroccan leaders, but he can get close. During the fourth stage, he led MoroccanAziz El Akadby nearly 20 minutes at one point; by the end, El Akad was just two minutes and nine seconds behind. Seven minutes and 30 seconds now separate Chema and El Akad in third and fourth place overall. El Akad said he turned up his speed at Checkpoint 6 after running with a slower rhythm through the beginning of the race. Multiple runners said the heat was worse for the fourth stage than previous days, and the Moroccan athletes guessed it reached above 110 degrees Fahrenheit during the middle of the day. “It is important that the team is first,” El Morabity said from his corner of the tent after El Akad explained his race day. “And it is important that Aziz is third.” Fernanda Macielis more than two hours down from leaderNatalia Sedykhin the overall rankings, but pushed ahead ofElisabet BarnesandAziza Rajiafter the 21st kilometer to secure a solid third overall ranking. She was dehydrated and struggled through the first part of the race, she said. The flat, lighter sand part of the course was ideal for her speed, and she reached that section of the trail by sunset. About 15 tents down from Maciel and the Spanish-speaking runners, the Russian athletes talked of Sedykh’s speed on the track and her ability to turn up the power went it is needed most—a skill which could come in handytomorrowifNathalie Mauclairis able to close the 23-minute gap between the two in the overall rankings. Nathalie Mauclair running toward her Stage 4 win. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 “I told her to focus on her eye contact,” saidMichal Glowacki, a Polish runner who finished 14th last year and stays in the tent down from Sedykh. If Mauclair leads, as long as she keeps her in eye contact, Sedykh can use her short-distance speed to get ahead in the final three to five kilometers, he said. Defending champ Elisabet Barnes struggled with the heat the first three days, she said, and broke off from Aziza Raji about halfway through the fourth stage to jump to fourth overall, more than four hours behind Sedykh. Maciel and Raji flew past her on the technical downhill of the first jebel after Checkpoint 1, she said. At about 55 kilometers, the heat started to subside, and she felt a lot better, Barnes said. She had paced for about 12 hours, and beat her goal by 34 minutes. “With eight percent humidity out here, you take a breath and it’s like your whole mouth is the desert,” she said. Multiple repeat competitors said throughout the past two days that they felt this race was harder than previous editions, on account of the heat and the punishing terrain and wind of Stage 1. Just about 100 runners had dropped out before the start of the long stage, and another 30 abandoned sometime throughout the fourth day.

Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 Stage 4 Competition Analysis [Editor’s Note:The competition analyses in this article have been written by iRunFar Senior EditorMeghan Hicks, who is not racing MdS this year but who has finished the MdS five times.] I don’t envy beingChema Martinezgoing into tomorrow’s Stage 5, the final competitive stage at a marathon’s distance. The guy has just run his heart out for four days in an attempt to be one of the few non-sandy-country-dwelling runners to get atop the MdS podium in the race’s competitive history. He’s sitting in third overall position, butAziz El Akadis 7.5 minutes back. Aziz is known in his history with MdS of ripping off the fifth marathon stage to finish five to 10 minutes back of his other Moroccan competitors, let alone the rest of the field. At this point, this is what I find to be the most interesting story of the men’s race. Can Olympian Chema hold off a Moroccan for the podium? Tomorrow’s gonna’ be intense! As forRachid El MorabityandAbdelkader El Mouazizat the front of the race, it’s looking like a repeat of last year, like our field reporter said. Rachid is just steady, steady, steady, and he always seems to have ample gas in the tank to turn it up and run like heck in the final kilometers of every stage. Methinks this part of the competition is already set and Rachid’s going to bring home his fourth MdS title. Not bad for a young guy born into socioeconomic challenge at the edge of the Sahara Desert, right? Holy smokes, whatNathalie Mauclairdid yesterday for the long stage is categorically off the charts for a woman at MdS or a woman at any race. She finished a few minutes less than an hour back of the Moroccan winners, in a 52-mile race that look the men a little over eight hours to finish. Compare that disparity to other 50-mile races around the world of that time length and difficulty, and you’d expect to see about a 75- to 80-minute deficit between top elite men and women. Talk about expanding the vision of what women can do. Though Nathalie won the long stage, she still has a 23-minute overall gap to leaderNatalia Sedykh. That’s a really difficult amount of time to surmount in the final marathon-distance Stage 5, closing in on a minute-per-mile difference. Of course, funnier things have happened in a race of this magnitude where there are so many more variables at hand besides just running, so we shall see. Of note, Natalia sits in 11th place overall in the rankings, and Nathalie 13th. Nathalia is 16.5 minutes behind the 10th place male overall, another difficult-to-surmount gap. Sure would be cool to see a woman inside the top-10 overall at a race like this one, though. It’s fascinating to see that the men’s top 10 and women’s top 10 seem to be about set for the race once we get out of the top-two women and top-four men. It would take someone getting injured or having a big blow-up for positions to change much at this point. So, focused, smart, and conservative running for those women and men for one more marathon! Stage 4 Route Information Here it is, the MdS long stage for 2016. Unusual format, a route that loops back upon itself again. Stage 4’s course has everything in it, tons of sandy terrain via small dune fields and dried creek beds, a couple rocky jebels or hills, dried-up lake beds, and other flat and more gentle terrain. It’s a fascinating course, which visits quintessential MdS locations, like the little gorge of El Maharch, and heads into terrain not typically visited by this race. At 84.3 kilometers in length, today is a real tough one, no matter the terrain. Of note, the MdS race admin starts the top-50 men and top-five women three hours after the rest of the field starts.

Stage 3 Field Report from iRunFar Correspondent [Editor’s Note:The field reports in this article have been written by iRunFar field correspondentJacqueline Kantor.] Shortly after1 p.m. local time, hours before the rest of the runners’ tents filled up with competitors, second-place femaleNathalie Mauclairjoined the Moroccan leaders in their tent to cook polenta and couscous over a small fire stoked by dried branches. The four Moroccan teammates and Mauclair stopped their chatting and cooking for a round of applause asAziza Raji,the lone Moroccan female in the field, returned back to camp with a fourth-place finish. After two consecutive days at sixth place, Raji jumped up to fourth in the 37.5-kilometer stage to land at fifth overall, which grants her a delayed start along with the other top-five women and the top-50 men–a tradition for the MdS’s long stage–in the beginning of the 84.3-kilometer fourth stagetomorrowmorning. “Today was good, just hotter,” she said. She didn’t change anything about her strategy, and hung with withFernanda Macielup until about Checkpoint 1. Maciel pushed ahead to take third and finish just about two minutes behind Mauclair, who again trailed RussianNatalia Sedykh. Much of the third stage was small, rolling hills and flat course broken up by camel grass. Runners began with a flat sandy stretch in between burnt-orange dunes covered with black stones on the right and brown-red plateau, called “Kam Kam” by the locals, on the left next to the dried-out river, “Zeezee.” One of Stage 3’s water checkpoints. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 Today was easier than yesterday, Mauclair said, and she’s learning better strategy for sand running each day. She kept in mind her mantra from back-to-back wins at the mountainousGrand Raid de la Réunion— “little steps by little steps by little steps”—and found that it worked just as well in shallow mounds of sand. Samir Akhdar, who finished fifth for the second day in a row, guessed that the temperature was about 100 degrees Fahrenheit by early afternoon. There was about six kilometers along a wadi, the dried riverbed of Oued Rheris, right before Checkpoint 3 where “you go from running easy and causal, to ‘I can’t breathe’ and you’re not going any faster,” saidDavid Hellard, who finished at 16th. That was right about the point where where the top-three finishers—Rachid El Morabity,Abdelkader El Mouaziz, andAziz El Akad—split off fromChema Martinezand Akhdar, Akhdar said. The top three finished with a bit more than a minute between each of them, and in the overall rankings, El Morabity leads. Martinez, the best bet for a non-local on the podium, finished about 13 minutes after El Akad and is now 44 minutes and 15 seconds behind El Morabity and third in the overall rankings. Abdelkader El Mouaziz (right) and Aziz El Akad, Moroccan teammates, run together during Stage 3. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 More gaps closed in the women’s race leading up to the long stage, and Mauclair was able to getwithin four minutesof Sedykh today after finishing about 14 minutes behind yesterday and 17 minutes behind on the first day. Maciel, who finished 21 minutes ahead of Raji, struggled at the beginning, but got into her rhythm at about the 15-kilometer mark. The heat is a non-issue for the Rio de Janeiro native, but the lack of incline is challenging. The ascent of Foum Al Opath, a jebel or rocky hill, at about 17 kilometers was a welcome incline for her. “It was flat, and it was hard because I ran all the way—I am from the mountains, where you run and walk as you go,” she said. “I’m learning how to move on the dunes, so now I can climb better.” “When I see rocks, any sort of little climb, I think to my self, ‘yes!!’” Maciel is easily the least experienced in MdS terrain of the top-five females. Barnes and Sedykh are repeat competitors, Raji is from Ouarzazate and had easy access to Sahara training, and, while it’s Mauclair’s first MdS, she trained in the Sahara for one week over the winter. Each day, Maciel feels less like she’s racing to win, and more like she’s racing to finish. “I give all my energy, all day, 200 percent, because I feel confident that I can recover during the night,” she said. Runners cross a jebel, or rocky hill, during Stage 3. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 Liza Howard, the top American female, dropped down to sixth among the women, so she will start with the rest of the field at8:15 a.m.during the long stage. The first half of Stage 3 was fine for her, but in the second, the heat hit in full force and derailed her physically. She scaled back to keep herself healthy. Missing the cutoff for a late start is ideal, she said, to avoid the heat of the day. Jason Schlarb, the top American male, is at 12th overall after an 11th-place finish in the third stage. Defending champElisabet Barnescame in at fifth and about 11 minutes behind Raji. She is now at fourth overall and about 55 minutes behind Maciel’s third place. Stage 3 Competition Analysis [Editor’s Note:The competition analyses in this article have been written by iRunFar Senior EditorMeghan Hicks, who is not racing MdS this year but who has finished the MdS five times.] After a couple days of shake-ups around the men’s top five to top 10, it seems like today was a more chill round for the boys. That said, tomorrow brings the long stage, something in the vicinity of 80 kilometers, and what that means is shake-ups abound.Rachid El MorabityandAbdelkader El Mouazizsit firmly at the top of the overall rankings going into tomorrow’s long stage. The pair goes into the long stage with a 45-minute lead on the rest of the field, so steady, non-risky running tomorrow will surely keep them atop the rankings. As for the duel between the two, Rachid holds just an 82-second lead over Abdelkader. I’m not 100% convinced that these guys are actually competing against each other per se, as opposed to working together to set themselves apart from the rest of the field. That also said, if they are racing each other, there’s no one besides the Moroccan Ahansal brothers–neither of whom are racing this year–who can race the MdS long stage like Rachid. There’s definitely a fierce battle evolving for third position right now between Spain’sChema Martinezand Morocco’sAziz El Akad. Aziz appears to have ran hard today to make up some of the deficit he had to Chema in the overall standings, finishing today’s stage third and only 1.5 minutes back of the lead. Chema enters the long day in third overall, but Aziz is just about four minutes back. For me, this is the most exciting part of the men’s race at the moment. Podium-ing in the MdS is a huge deal for Moroccan male athletes–a huge source of national pride. And since European and North American men so rarely make it to the men’s podium, I’m sure Chema wants it real bad, too. The last time a non-sandy-country-dwelling person was on the MdS podium was 2012 whenMichael Wardiantook third in the overall rankings. Tomorrow’s long-stage battle between Chema and Aziz is going to be good. As for the women’s race,Natalia Sedykhwon the stage again, but this time she was only four minutes ahead ofNathalie Mauclair. Lots of questions emerge here. Did Natalia slow down or did Nathalie speed up? And if Natalia slowed, did she do that intentionally ahead of tomorrow’s long stage or is she starting to feel the fatigue of running two days at unheard-of-for-a-woman-at-MdS speeds? Based on today’s results, it appears that Natalia, indeed, ran slower relative to the men’s field today as compared to Stages 1 and 2. And it also appears that Nathalie didn’t speed up, but that she ran about the same pace relative to the men’s field today as the first two days. So we are left wondering the reason behind Natalia’s slower pace today and what will happen tomorrow. After a slow start on Stage 1,Fernanda Macielhas finished third woman in both Stages 2 and 3, and only a couple minutes each day behind Nathalie Mauclair in second. It seems like she’s digging her heels in and figuring what this MdS thing is all about. She’s a long-haul specialist, so I imagine she’s going to do just fine in tomorrow’s long stage. HolyAziza Raji, she finished fourth today! The little Moroccan firecracker, I was told by my Moroccan friends, has great potential in the MdS, but that she needs some time to develop as an athlete. They said she will get stronger as the race goes on, and as the years go on. It seems they are predicting correctly. Aziza now sits in fifth in the overall rankings, but she’s just 17 minutes back of defending champElisabet Barnes. Tomorrow’s race between this pair is going to be a great one to watch as well. It appears that Elisabet Barnes isn’t racing with the same fitness this year as in 2015. Today she finished fifth and some 45 minutes back from the lead. In watching her race with such strength on her way to her win last year, I don’t expect to see any huge dips in her performance during tomorrow’s long stage. I predict steady-as-she-goes pace. The only question is if that pace will be enough to fend off Aziza. Liza Howardappears to have had a rough day today, finishing 12th and 90 minutes off the lead. This puts her a full two hours out of podium contention going into the long stage. She’s now in sixth in the overall standings, and about 39 minutes out of the top five. Again, big shake-ups happen during the long stage, so if Liza can put together a big day tomorrow, I think she can nose her way back into the women’s top five. Also interesting to her race is that the MdS starts the top-five women (and top-50 men) three hours after the rest of the field. So Liza and the women behind her in the rankings will race separately from the five front women and won’t know how they are stacking up until after the stage. Three-time MdS championLaurence Klein(France) dropped from the race on Stage 2. We don’t know the reason. Stage 3 Route Information The MdS’s course creators always go a little ‘easy’ with their design of Stage 3 course, probably because the looooong Stage 4 beckons and everyone could use an ‘easier’ day beforehand. Today runners had flat, runnable terrain for most of the stage’s 37.5-kilometer distance, though they encountered several shorter dune fields, one small jebel (rocky hill), and likely some very sandy terrain at the edge of Oued Rheris. Oued Rheris is an MdS mainstay: it’s a giant, sandy, dry wash, and one of the main drainages of this part of the Sahara. It’s a really cool feature of the ecosystem especially because, while there isn’t water unless there’s been rain within a few days, you’ll often run past blooming flowers and trees, a sure sign of it being spring in the desert and a welcome sight after so many kilometers of starker terrain. That said, depending on the route you take through it, it can make for some super sandy running. Stage 3 route map. Image courtesy of the Marathon des Sables.

Stage 2 Field Report from iRunFar Correspondent [Editor’s Note:The field reports in this article have been written by iRunFar field correspondentJacqueline Kantor.] Stage 2 sent the runners off with their packs to the punishing dunes that fatigued elites and led to more than 20 dropouts on the first day, and “Another One Bites the Dust” aptly greeted the crowd for an8:30 a.m.start. The beginning of the course led through a sandy, stony flat stretch and onward to smaller, darker orange dunes covered with black stones.Monday’s41.3-kilometer course featured smaller sand hills and stony terrain through wadis and two small villages, and minimal obstacles allowed for faster speeds. There was more running and less thinking, said several of the top finishers, but the increased pace exhausted more technical runners and allowed for the heat of the desert—close to 90 degrees Fahrenheit by late afternoon—to fully set in. The start of Stage 2. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Compagnie MdS 2016 Defending champRachid El Morabityagain took first, this time with a 26-second edge on teammateAbdelkader El Mouaziz, finishing at a 4:56/kilometer pace (7:57/mile). He averaged 5:36/kilometer (9:00/mile) through the sand and wind yesterday.El Mouaziz entered Checkpoint 1 first withAbderrahmane Moatacim,Hammou Moudouji, and El Morabity close behind. Morabity and El Mouaziz had just about a minute on the closest runners behind until Checkpoint 3 at 32.5 kilometers. They took advantage of the flat, sandy, and sparsely-vegetated final kilometers to gain close to a 20-minute advantage onAziz El AkadandJose Manuel Chema Martinez, who finished hand-in-hand. El Morabity picked up his pace significantly toward the end because of the trailing competitors, he said, and having El Akad and Martinez on his tail provided extra motivation.Tomorrow, he’ll look to conserve energy for the long stage on Day 4. “This stage was not very difficult, it was very fast, and the wind made it a little complicated,” Martinez said. “I’m very happy today. It’s difficult to beat the Moroccans, but I am getting closer. They live here. They know the mountain, the sand. They have a control of the way. I try to stay with them. I was tired, but everyone is tired today.” Runners likeCarlos Sa, who finished at the same time asJean-Sebastien Braun, found the speed of Stage 2 challenging; others savored the opportunity to focus more on pace and less on navigation. “This was way better than yesterday,” saidSondre Amdahl, who finished seventh. “Yesterday I had problems with seeing ahead, today I could just concentrate on running. It was a good effort throughout.” Jason Schlarb and David Hellard in Stage 2’s small sand dunettes and camelgrass. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 Natalia Sedykhof Russia, who made a spirited finish yesterday to take first place among women by 17 minutes, entered the bivouac today equally optimistic at 10th-place overall and first female. She finished 36 minutes behind El Morabity and 14 minutes ahead of the second woman,Nathalie Mauclair.“It was perfect, just like a stadium,” said Sedykh, who specializes in the 10k. Last year, she ran her first half marathon in January, her first marathon in February, and her first Marathon des Sablestwo months later. She has a 2:46 marathon PR from last fall and has run 33:54 for 10,000m in 2011. She returned to the desert this year looking to right her rankings after a one-hour penalty knocked her to third place last year. “I believe in magic,” she said last night, after resting up in her tent with a crew of fellow Russians. “I am very surprised to be first, but I am highly motivated from last year. I know it’s only the last finish line that matters. I’m just thinking about the next day, and then the next day after that.” Mauclair came through the finish equally cheery after a “faster course than usual,” she said, and was followed byFernanda Macielabouttwo minutes later. Maciel’s prep for this race includes a record-breaking ascent of Aconcagua, the highest mountain in South America, in February. The effort at altitude left Maciel anemic, she said, and she’s feeling the strain after two days of desert. But the speed in Stage 2 suited her better, she said, given her lack of experience with dune running. “Today I enjoyed all the course,” she said. “I love the wind, because you feel fresh when it’s against you.” Samir Akhdarentered his eighth MdS last year with a goal of finishing in the top five. He finished fourth, and entered this year’s aiming for the top-three spot claimed by El Akad last year. He held tight with El Akad and Martinez until Checkpoint 2 today, then fell off by 11 minutes by the finish. The next few stages, particularly the longest, are the most important, he said, and he’s hoping to gain the time back on the longest day. “I took my time and went slowly, but it was better than yesterday,” he said. Yesterday’s second-place finisher, MoroccanHammou Moudouji,dropped down to 28th in Stage 2 after doubling back to retrieve his water card. He  realized he dropped it at about one kilometer past Checkpoint 3, and ran back four kilometers before finding a runner who had retrieved it at Checkpoint 2. Continuing without the card would have resulted in an hour penalty, and at this stage in the race, retracing his steps was less risky than running onward. Otherwise, the course was “very flat, very easy,” he said, and easier than yesterday besides the heat. Moudouji specializes in the marathon and is making his first MdS appearance. Moudouji’s misstep andEdgar Parra Tolero’sdrop down from the top 10 made room for AmericanJason Schlarb, who finished 15th yesterday, to take 10th man and 11th overall today.

Campagnie MdS 2016 Stage 2 Competition Analysis [Editor’s Note:The competition analyses in this article have been written by iRunFar Senior EditorMeghan Hicks, who is not racing MdS this year but who has finished the MdS five times.] Holy smokes, not only is this year’s women’s race the most competitive we’ve yet seen at the MdS, but it could also be the most interesting in the race’s 31-year history.Natalia Sedykhblew it out of the water again today, finishing 10th overall for Stage 2. I don’t think a woman’s ever finished in the top 10 of an MdS stage before, unless we’re talking in the race’s first couple years when it had very few entrants. She’s truly hauling. Tomorrow should be fascinating. Is she running sustainably for a week of racing? Time will tell. Nathalie Mauclairran stronger today in second than she did yesterday, finishing about 14 minutes back from Natalia in a longer stage as opposed to yesterday’s 17 minutes from the lead. And here comesFernanda Maciel. After finishing out of contention of the lead yesterday, Fernanda was third and about 16 minutes back today. With Fernanda’s strong push today, she moved herself up into third position in the overall rankings. Both Nathalie and Fernanda have proven themselves in long mountain endeavors, so how they fare in coming days will be fascinating, too. Defending champElisabet Barnesis now in fourth in the overall rankings. She finished a 30-minute deficit to the lead yesterday and a little over 41 minutes today, a longer stage. It seems like her pace is steady relative to the women’s lead through both of the first two stages, but that she’s running slower relative to the men this year than when she won last year. Liza Howardfinished Stage 2 in fifth, and is now fifth in the overall standings, too. She gave 37 minutes to the lead yesterday and 47 minutes today. Like Elisabet, Liza’s pace relative to the women’s lead seems pretty steady, and overall pretty close comparatively to her pace from last year relative to the top men. Great stuff in the men’s race, too! We have a non-Moroccan in the overall top three right now, SpaniardChema Martinez! However, he’s got MoroccansSamir AkhdarandAziz El Akadbreathing down his back in the overall standings. There have been huge shake-ups in the top of the men’s race in just the first two days, and so there are sure to be more. One thing seems sure, though:Rachid El MorabityandAbdelkader El Mouazizhave clearly started putting on their clinic over the rest of the runners. The pair finished one-two and 19 minutes ahead of the rest of the field today, which puts Rachid ahead of everyone else who isn’t Abdelkader by a full 39 minutes in the overall rankings. This is a lot of time, many more minutes than we are used to seeing at just two stages into the MdS in the race’s last decade or so. The question is, are those two putting in more of an effort in these first days to break from the field more strongly? Or, is the pair running similar to the previous couple years with others in the field being unable to challenge as closely this year? From the field we hear that the pair ran the last quarter of the race a lot faster than the rest of the field, so perhaps they were, indeed, trying to dig in a little lead over everyone else. Stage 2 Route Information At just shy of a full marathon’s distance and so some seven kilometers longer than Stage 1, Stage 2 took the lead men about 15 minutes longer than yesterday, which means today’s course was significantly more runnable. Much of the first two thirds of the course was flat, runnable terrain, from the starting line to the second water checkpoint at 34.5k. After that, it was a brief and rugged crossing of a jebel, or hill in Arabic, to the finish line. Stage 2 route map. Image courtesy of the Marathon des Sables.

Stage 1 Field Report from iRunFar Correspondent [Editor’s Note:The field reports in this article have been written by iRunFar field correspondentJacqueline Kantor.] The difficult dune passages and strong headwinds in the first stage left even the most skilled local competitors struggling as they crossed the finish line afternoonSunday. About 30 minutes after defending champRachid El Morabitycompleted the first stage, his teammateAbderrahmane Moatacimwalked slowly down the last dunes of Erg Znaigui and toward the second bivouac until teammateAziz El Akadcaught up with him. Akad grabbed his hand to lead him into a jog until the finish. The pair stepped off to the side quickly, and as Akad helped his teammate pull off his pack for a moment of relief,Natalia Sedykhof Russia sprinted through the finish line smiling and seemingly unfazed by the same course that had a left a local defeated. She was the 13th finisher overall, the first female, and the first runner to cross the finish line grinning. Rachid El Morabity won Stage 1 by a few-second margin. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 “That was very nice,” she told the staff waiting by the finish line. “Thank you for all the sand.” Sedykh finished in an unofficial 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 20 seconds, and did not realize she was the first female finisher until an interview with the Moroccan media. “I am happy but it is only the beginning,” she said, still grinning and bouncing on her feet. “We have a very difficult path ahead.” Natalia Sedykh was the runaway women’s Stage 1 winner. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 The first stage began at9 a.m.with a light breeze and a direct path into the Erg Chebbi dunes for about 12 kilometers; it ended with three kilometers through the Erg Znaigui dunes and a fierce wind that drew directly into the runners’ path and picked up significantly about an hour after the first runners returned to the bivouac. The Moroccan men swept the first three spots—El Morabity,Hammou Moudouji(MdS novice, road runner), andAbdelkader El Mouazizall finished within 35 seconds of each other. Moatacim had rolled through the first checkpoint with the leaders, but fell back as the top three stayed tight together until the last few meters. The top three ran together up until the last meters. The men’s lead pack, led by Rachid El Morabity, worked the Stage 1 sand dunes. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 “The wind creates problems,” El Mouaziz said. “And it’s more difficult this year because there are others that are very strong, competitors from Europe and America. It puts a little stress on us.” Right after the finish, El Morabity went straight to the counter where runners pick up post-run cups and slouched down with his head toward the table. El Mouaziz, the captain of his team, grabbed him and Moudouji into a huddle as the three recovered from their final sprint. By the timeJose Manuel ‘Chema’ Martinezof Spain rolled in about nine minutes after the first trio, the wind had picked up, and the dunes just beyond the finish line were obscured by sand. Nathalie Mauclairwas the second woman and 17 minutes and 10 seconds behind Sedykh, and found that the elements made tactical decisions in the sand trickier. “I always have to be looking to see where to place my feet for the dunes,” she said. “But it was difficult to see.” The course spit the runners out of the dunes right at Checkpoint 1. They jogged past a lone muddy brown house and clubs of acacia trees before a dry wadi and flat, sandy stretch that looked deceivingly solid, said defending champElisabet Barnes, who camein 13 minutesand 27 seconds behind Mauclair. It reminded her of the soft sand of theOman Desert Marathon, and provided little relief after the dunes. “Once we finally got to the flat ground, that’s when we got the tough headwinds,” she said. “It was a tough stage given the amount of sand.” “Those sand dunes were mean,” saidHarvey Lewis, who finished at 16th and three seconds behind fellow AmericanJason Schlarb. Liza Howardof the U.S. finished about sevenminutes after Barnes in fourth placeand said the stage was tougher than any of the first three days in the 2015 edition; first-timerMeghan Arbogast(USA), who came in seventh, called it the “harshest environment I’ve ever run in.” “The wind was so relentless, and so loud,” she said. “I just jogged along and didn’t fight the wind. And if it’s like this every day, it’s going to be really tough.” Stage 1 featured a 12-kilometer crossing of the Erg Chebbi, one of Morocco’s largest dune fields. Photo: Cimbaly/V. Campagnie MdS 2016 Stage 1 Competition Analysis [Editor’s Note:The competition analyses in this article have been written by iRunFar Senior EditorMeghan Hicks, who is not racing MdS this year but who has finished the MdS five times.] Because the MdS’s live-tracking system malfunctioned for Stage 1, we don’t yet have access to splits and positions on top runners through each checkpoint today, so we won’t analyze the competition too much. However, a few notes become apparent with the data we’ve so far received from the field: Stage 1 Route Information The 2016 MdS Stage 1 route began with three kilometers of flat running straight toward one of Morocco’s largest and tallest field of dunes, the Erg Chebbi. Then runners contended with a 12k crossing of that dune field. The field’s shifting sands with little to no navigational markers on the first day, when everyone’s packs are the heaviest, was surely the day’s greatest challenge for most. Upon exiting the dunes, runners hit the first water checkpoint, and continued onto a relatively flat section lasting all the way to the second water checkpoint at 25.8k. This section surely saw the top runners hammering at some of the fastest speeds we’ll see them all week, though contending with the hidden obstacles and challenges always present in this part of the Sahara Desert. From there, it was variable terrain, some hills and another small set of sand dunes, until the finish, 34k from where it all started earlier in the day. Stage 1 route map. Image courtesy of the Marathon des Sables. The MdS Roadbook route instructions for Stage 1. Image courtesy of the Marathon des Sables.  Check-In Day Field Report from iRunFar Correspondent All around the bivouac on the day before the start of the 2016 Marathon des Sables, competitors spent their first full day in the desert making last-minute adjustments and exploring the MdS village that popped up in the Sahara about eight miles from the village of Merzouga. First-timers packed and repacked their bags nervously before parting with their less necessary belongings; elite runners talked of heat acclimation and quick trips to desolate trails in the last month. Last-minute, pre-race race training ranged from 48 hours in Death Valley (BadwaterchampHarvey Lewisof the U.S.) to four days on the beach in Rio de Janiero (Fernanda Macielof Brazil) to two weeks in the Sahara and in the Middle Atlas mountains of Morocco (three-time winnerRachid El Morabityand his Moroccan team). El Morabity’s crew of likely podium finishers—Abdelkader El Mouazis (second place in 2015),Aziz El Akad(third place in 2015) andAbderrahmane Moatacim(first-time MdS competitor) — spent much of their time at Erg Chebbi, which will provide the starting terrain for tomorrow’s Stage 1 of the 31st edition. The pink-orange dunes loomed in the background of the bivouac, providing a perfect photo op for runners to pose with their gear as well as an ominous sign of the 34 kilometers ahead. The first stage starts in the dunes, heads into the village of M’Fis, and onward to mines, through variably hilly terrain and into a small gorge before ending just beyond the Erg Znaigui dunes. “I’m feeling all right, very relaxed,” El Mouaziz said as he stood at the entrance of the circle of runner’s tents, greeting runners from last year and posing for photos with El Morabity and foreign friends and fans. The Moroccan men snagged the top-four spots last year, withSalameh Al Aqraof Jordan in fifth andJose Manuel ‘Chema’ Martinezof Spain a spot behind. The best bets to challenge Martinez as the top non-Moroccan male could be one of three contenders joined together by Team I Run 4 Hope. Lewis,Jason Schlarb(USA), andCarlos Sá(Portugal) are all potential top-10 finishers and part of a team looking to raise awareness for children with ADHD. Lewis was able to fit some sand dunes into training with his brief trip to Death Valley—“but not as big as those,” he said, pointing to Erg Chebbi in the distance. “But I’m happy about it.” He ran 62 kilometersin 48 hoursduring that trip, and at home in Cincinnati, Ohio, he runs the 10 kilometers to and from work every day at a public-arts school with his backpack and the backpack of a student. Cincinnati is hilly enough to offer some prep for this race, Lewis said, and running in the snow is not the same as the thin sand of the Sahara, but still offers a considerable challenge. Lewis will turn 40 on the day of the longest stage of the race, and said all of his training and “chipping, chipping, chipping away” at personal goals has led to this point. “When I first started running, at 15, it took me five years to break a five-hour marathon,” he said. “It took me 17 years to qualify for theBoston Marathon. It took me 22 years to make the U.S. team, and it’s all led to this—the fastest I’ve been in my life will betomorrow.” Schlarb, his tentmate and teammate, took two quick trips to the desert nearby his home of Durango, Colo., to get prepped. He’s drawn to cold-climate races but was convinced to compete after hearingDave Mackey, the top American finisher in the 2015 edition, call it a “life experience.” “It’s unlike just showing up to a race. You hang out, you talk, you gain friendship, while having this challenge of carrying everything, and challenging the body and the mind.” The runners spent their last day before self-sufficiency lounging around in sleeping pads they would soon abandon, fastening country flags to the otherwise indistinguishable black tents in the runner’s village, and getting to know their tentmates that would greet them back at camp throughout the week. “This is unlike anything else,” saidLiza Howard, who was in podium contention last year before getting sick during the fourth stage. “There’s the racing and the running, and then the culture—this strange tent city that exists, away from communication, no phones, no Kindles.” 2016 MdS runners listen to the check-in day runner briefing. Photo: iRunFar/Jacqueline Kantor Her tentmate and fellow top female contender,Meghan Arbogast, is making her first appearance at Marathon des Sables. She’s looking forward to the running, and dreading the cold at night. “This is a new experience,” she said. “A clean slate.” Defending championElisabet Barneshas returned to the race with a vastly different welcome than last year. In 2015, she was a relative unknown who had placed 15th in her first MdS in 2012. This year, she’s getting used to the new attention from media and other runners, and coming off a “year of transition” marked by a hectic work and running schedule, in part due to her win last year. The draw of the MdS is the ability to spend a week focusing on the basics—eat, sleep, run—and her defending title means that simplicity is somewhat complicated already. “I’m going to run my own race,” she said of the competitive women’s field this year. “You can’t get drawn into what other people are doing, because it’s such an extreme environment. You have to race with your head.” Related articles:"
2016 Transgrancanaria Results,"Runners and spectators alike were treated to great conditions at Transgrancanaria 2016. With an 11 p.m. start, runners faced 8 or 9 hours of cool temperatures with the occasional run through a cloud before a moderately warm day with some clouds and some breezes. These conditions along with a slightly shorter course, even if over more technical last 20 kilometers, made for some fast finishes at the front of the men’s and women’s field, including both winners–Didrik Hermansen(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) andCaroline Chaverot(pre-andpost-raceinterviews). That said, there were plenty who didn’t fare so well over the relentless 125-kilometer course with more than 26,000′ (8,000m) of climbing. Let’s see how things shook out. With as deep a field as Transgrancanaria had on the men’s side, you expect a large pack to go out together and last at least until 30 kilometers. That more or less happened… except that France’sAurélien Colletwent off the front and stayed there… for a very long time. In fact, his early breakaway looked like it might hold as he had a two-to-four-minute lead for most of the race until… well, I’m getting ahead of myself. Aurélien Collet leading in Tunte. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By the marathon mark, a chase group of four runners seemed to solidify:Gediminas Grinius(last year’s champ) (pre-andpost-raceinterviews),Andy Symonds,Diego Pazos, andPau Capell. Plenty of top talent, includingYan Long-Fei,Jonas Buud, Didrik Hermansen, andJulien Chorier, chased within 12 minutes of the lead. Long-Fei would drop soon after with an ankle injury. Grinius continued to lead the chase pack with Symonds, Pazos, and Capell bouncing around behind him. Hermansen and Buud had been running together, but Hermansen pulled away from Swede and started making up ground on the chase pack. He caught Symonds not long after mid-race as the Brit suffered from cramping. Gediminas Grinius running in third at Tunte. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At the head of the race, Collet still led at Tunte (94km), but he looked worked. Only three minutes back was Norway’s Hermansen. As I wrote at the time, Hermansen was “leading from behind.” There was no doubt that he would catch the Frenchman. His only likely remaining challenger for the win would be the Lithuanian, Grinius, who appeared to be battling… looking strong, but not without strain. Hermansen, on the other hand, looked fluid and at ease. However, both men later recounted passing one another multiple times with Didrik having the advantage on the descents and Gediminas on the climbs. Diego Pazos and Pau Capell rather through Tunte together, as they would for the rest of the race. Two thirds of the way into the race and you start to see the cream rise to the top with the likes of Symonds, Buud, and Chorier running in sixth through eighth. Diego Pazos and Pau Capell running together in Tunte. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Moving ahead to Ayagaures, 107 kilometers into the race and we saw the first lead change. Having moved up from running in the teens early on, Hermansen had the lead with Grinius only two minutes back. Collet now ran in third, but had given up 8 minutes in 14 kilometers… his race would get uglier from there. With Capell and Pazos 18 minutes in arrears in Ayagaures, it was a two man race. Didrik Hermansen wins Transgrancanaria 2016. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell As he’d been doing so for some time, Hermansen continued to outrun Gediminas on the descents that dominated the race’s final 18 kilometers (although he felt pressure on the 3-kilometer climb out of Ayagaures) and won in 13:41, four minutes ahead of Grinius. Compressport teammates Capell and Pazos moved up a spot to tie for third. Andy Symonds managed to control his cramps to end up in fifth. The biggest surprise in the top ten was Lithuania’sVaidas Zlabys, who took eighth, a marked improvement over his 36th-place finish at last year’s Transgrancanaria. While long-time leader Collet imploded after Ayagaures, he did walk it in to finish in 19th.

Throughout the race she put more or less one minute per kilometer on the next closest women. Early in the race that included two-time defending champNúria Picas(pre-race interview), but she retired with an injury at Artenara, 34 kilometers into the race. After that, Chaverot looked untouchable. She always looked as strong or stronger than the ladies behind her and she continued to build her massive lead en route to a two-hour win. It was domination, pure and simple. Caroline Chaverot leading in Fontanales. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Behind Chaverot, ran Switzerland’sAndrea Huser(post-race interview) and Basque runnerUxue Fraile(post-race interview). The two actually ran together for a decent stretch, as the two have done in other races, before the Swiss woman opened a small lead that she’d hold until the finish. Fraile overcame a pre-race lack of confidence, based on a less-than-stellar run at TGC two years ago when it was her longest race to date, to take third. Uxue Fraile and Andrea Huser together in Fontanales. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell AlthoughSilvia Triguerosmanaged to put a scare into Fraile mid-race, she would finish more than an hour back… and just ahead of four other women who would finish within 15 minutes of her. Perhaps the biggest surprise in the top ten was Argentina’sAdrianna Vargas’sfifth place finish with a very consistent race. Her previous international highlights included a 14th at Transvulcania in 2014 and finishing between 25th and 25th at the two most recent IAU Trail World Championships. Notably, last year’s third-place womanDong Lirefused to drop out and finished ninth. Silvia Trigueros runs through Tejeda in fourth.

2016 Tarawera Ultramarathon Results,"Sweden’sJonas Buud(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and New Zealand’sFiona Hayvice(post-race interview) executed victorious races in warm but, at times, heavy rain at the 2016Tarawera Ultramarathon. In addition to this article, you can find our a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on our 2016 Taraweralive coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back. Ps.

From the get go, it wasJonas BuudandDavid Byrnetogether off the front of the men’s pack, setting the pace and a gap from the rest of the field. The pair hung together, trading positions and working the course through about two thirds of the race when Jonas became the solo leader, ever building his lead on David and the rest of the field from there. At Titoki at about 72 kilometers, his lead was already in excess of eight minutes, and it only grew from there to more than 22 at the finish. Jonas looked masterful in his treatment of the terrain, distance, and competition today. He’s truly proving himself among the top runners in the world at ultra distances on all kinds of terrain. Jonas Buud on his way to winning the 2016 Tarawera Ultramarathon. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Aussie speedsterDavid Byrne(post-race interview) has been on our radar since early 2015 when he went top five among a competitive field at the MSIG Sai Kung 28k Skyrunning race in Hong Kong. Besides there, he’d faced off in shorter trail ultras with some of stoutest competition from the land down under. David is a former short-distance runner, with some speedy track PRs including 3:41 for the 1,500 meters. He’s turning that ridiculous leg speed into a successful foray with ultrarunning. Today was his longest ultra yet–by a full 40k!–and this is what he did. What we have to say about that: look out world, he’s just getting started. David Byrne looks relieved to finish second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Well, well, well, if it isn’tRyan Sandes(pre-race interview), and he’s back. After a tough late 2014 and most of 2015, it seems Ryan has returned to the pointy end of the field. In our pre-race interview with him, he said he thinks that he overdid it with his running in early 2014, and it took this length of time to fully recover. Today he looked nimble and smooth, like so many times we’ve seem him in the past, earning his podium place. Ryan Sandes was strong and steady all day.

Armstrong would hang on for his sixth-straight top-five finish. Mr. Consistent, Vajin Armstrong, was first Kiwi across the line in fifth. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. New Zealand’sRuby Muirwas the heavy women’s favorite ahead of the race, and she led pretty much from ‘go’ until she could run no more, a few kilometers before the 80k aid station. She’s had quadriceps issues for a while now, so we had expected that, if Ruby would need to drop from the race, it would be her leg that did her in. Instead, it was her stomach that failed. When she dropped, she told us she’d been fighting her stomach for the last 40k. Ruby Muir leading at Blue Lake early on. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell CountrymateFiona Hayvice, who jumped onto our radar by taking fourth here last year, was today’s lady in wait, rolling through aid stations a bit back from Ruby, not necessarily in contact, but not too far back. She looked peppy and engaged whenever we saw her. Once she took over leadership of the race with 20k to go, it was high sailing for her. Fiona Hayvice running in second early in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It was really an Australasia women’s race all along, wasn’t it?Melissa Robertson, of Australia, was the second woman today.

2016 Vibram Hong Kong 100k Results,"France’sFrançois D’haene(post-race interview) and China’sDong Li(post-race interview) won the 2016Vibram Hong Kong 100kin highly unusual conditions for Hong Kong. Indeed, in many ways, the cold, windy weather was the story of the race. Thick frost forced the race administration to briefly reroute the race course off an open paved road and onto a nearby trail so runners wouldn’t be endangered by cars driving in slippery conditions up toward the race’s and city’s high point to spectate. Runners reported that the race course–including its roads, trails, and thousands of stairs–was frost covered, and as the race progressed into the overnight hours, that frost turned to thickening ice. In the end, the race was cancelled 24 hours into the 30-hour cutoff for safety reasons. In addition to this article, you can find oura collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on our 2016 Vibram Hong Kong 100klive coverage page.

Thanks toVibramfor making our coverage of the 2016 Vibram Hong Kong 100k possible! Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The first 10k of the race were as one would expect for a race with a speedy start. Aside fromBed Sunuwartaking it out hard enough to have a slight lead before soon dropping back, there were nearly 10 runners in a pack including favoritesFrançois D’haene(post-race interview),Yan Long Fei(post-race interview), andGediminas Grinius(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Also in that group was local runnerVlad Ixel, who joined the other four runners mentioned to together as the rest of the lead pack fell off by 28k. Seven kilometers later, Vlad, too, had fallen a few minutes off the lead pack whilePau Capell,Jordi Gamito, andTsutomu Nagatagave chase. Francois d’Haene on his way to winning the 2016 Vibram Hong Kong 100k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By half way, François and Yan ran alone in the front. François would gain advantage on the technical sections while Yan would hold the edge on the flatter stretches. Having won last year, Yan surged on a long road climb around 70k and built a minute or two lead on François that he’d maintain for most of the race… until François caught him with about 1k remaining on the final climb. The Frenchman would put five minutes on the Chinese runner in the final few kilometers en route to a course record. Yan Long-Fei after finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell After the race, Yan noted that he accidentally left his warm layers in a pack he swapped midrace and suffered mightily from the cold. Gediminas Grinius is happy to finish third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Meanwhile, Gediminas ran alone in third place for a majority of the race. While he was running well, it quickly became apparent that he was unlikely to reel in either of the two leaders and, instead, he focused on running a consistent race to take third. Full results. Last year,Dong Li(post-race interview) led most of the Vibram Hong Kong 100k beforeWyan Chowcaught her late in the race. This year’s race was the Dong Li show from start to finish. From the outset, she ran at a more conservative pace. She was joined by Basque runnerSilvia Triguerosin the early part of the race, but she powered on to take the win. Champion Dong Li and third place Silvia Trigueros racing early. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell After Silvia fell off Dong’s pace, she fell into the company of Italy’sLisa Borzani(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) who took third in last year’s race. At times the two ran together for long stretches, while they would trade places in others. Second place Lisa Borzani moving in the race’s early kilometers.

2016 Western States 100 Lottery Results,"The lottery for the 2016Western States 100took place yesterday, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. However, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. The WS100 website hasan up-to-date list of the 2016 Western States 100 entrants. Let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into WS100 so far. The women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2016. Everyone exceptEmma RocaandNikki Kimball–who finished her 10th WS100 this year–are returning. The men’s top 10 from 2015are also invitedto return. We will see just six of the top 10 from this year back for 2016, with two-time champRob Krar,Jared Hazen, andGediminas Grinius, andJulien Chorieropting out. These are some speedy men and women who achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery methods. A total of 270 names were drawn during yesterday’s lottery, and among them were a small number of speedy and notable athletes. Top runners still have three routes by which they can gain entry into the 2016 WS100. Golden Ticket Races The previous Montrail Ultra Cup race series, which awarded entries into WS100 and prize money for the series, has dissolved for 2016. In its place is the six-raceGolden Ticket Races(now sponsored by Sharman Ultra Endurance Coaching ), and up to 24 WS100 entries will be given to top finishers of these races: Ultra-Trail World Tour For 2016, six slots will be given to top international contenders via the WS100’s participation in theUltra-Trail World Tour. Details on who will be awarded these UTWT slots in 2016is forthcoming. UltraRunningRace Series TheUltraRunningRace Serieswill award entry to the runners at the top of its ranking on April 24, 2016.

2016 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"First of all, congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2016Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run. With this year’s race proceeding in the perceived-to-be faster, clockwise direction, lottery entrants were up to 1,549 over last year’s lottery which had 1,367 applicants. All of these tickets (6,587 total) for 152 coveted slots for the privilege of running, hiking, and being supported on one of the most beautiful mountain courses in the world. Prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants in divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with Hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. The divisions are ‘First-Timers’ from which 47 spots in the run were given, ‘Veterans’ from which 35 spaces were given, and ‘Everyone Else’ from which 70 spaces were given. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end continues to grow in competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which Hardrock prides itself upon. Below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2016 contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in. Last year the waitlists went 9 deep (13 in 2014) in the ‘Never’ category. In the ‘Else’ lottery the waitlist went 12 deep (16 in 2014), and in the ‘Veteran’ category the entire waitlist of 8 runners will likely get into the race. A special thank you toRob Erskinewho provided this information through his blog. The competition on the men’s side most certainly features two-time returning championKilian Jornetwho is likely returning to better his clockwise direction course record from 2014 of 22:41:33. While he is largely considered unbeatable on this mountain course boasting some 33,000 feet of ascent, he will be challenged byXavier Thévenardwho has two Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc titles and could provide the most considerable challenge to Jornet yet. Throw inJason Schlarbwho has been incredibly consistent over the past two years in long, technical mountain races, and that should be an exciting race to watch.Nick Clarktook a bit of a sabbatical last year, but he has the experience and skills to also make the podium at Hardrock. Who knows what we will see out ofTimothy Olson, who has been pining to return for revenge on this course ever since his gutsy finish after an epic blow-up in 2014.Jeff Browningis always consistent in long mountain races. Additionally, cagey returnees such asTroy Howard,Scott Jaime, andTed Mahonrarely have off-days. All in all, a solid men’s field. On the women’s side, this is the deepest field in recent memory with a lot of tough and experienced women who’ve performed well here in the past. Last year’s championAnna Frostwill be returning to defend her title in the opposite direction. She will likely be chased by the entire podium from last year. Included are three-time champDarcy Piceu, who is on the ‘Veterans’ waitlist but who will probably get in, as well asDarla Askewwho was third here last year. Newcomer to Hardrock,Bethany Lewis, has not lost a 100-mile race yet and recently won the Fat Dog 120 Mile in British Columbia which is reportedly more difficult than Hardrock.Missy GosneyandMeghan Hicks(4th and 7th from last year) now have experience on this course which will further place them in contention. Throw inPetra Pirc, a tough mountain runner who was third at the 2014 Bear 100 Mile, andBetsy Kalmeyer, who is going for her 17th(!!!!) finish and who was second in 2014, as well asKatie DeSplinter, who is high on the First-Timers waitlist but who will probably get in. There is only one way to gain auto entry into Hardrock, and that is by winning last year’s race.Kilian JornetandAnna Frosthave both chosen to use those entries. Here are the men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Here are the women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. Here are the male contenders who were chosen in the top-20 slots of the First-Timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These men have a good shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. Here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-20 slots of the First-Timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These women have a decent shot of running. Here are some fast men who are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. Here are some fast women who are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. Related articles:"
2015 The North Face 50 Mile Championships Results,"The 2015The North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Mile Championshipstook place today in California’s Marin Headlands. The efforts of ColoradansZach Miller(pre-andpost-race interviews) andMegan Kimmel(pre-andpost-race interviews) paid off with the men’s and women’s wins and $10,000 paydays. Read on to find out how the rest of the race played out. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on our TNF 50live coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to TNF 50-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Looking down on Stinson Beach, part of the TNF EC 50 Mile course. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks The men’s race was so interesting! The previous two years each had a massive group of guys motoring together or nearly so for the first 15 or 20 miles, before the pace caused the group to splinter and for leadership roles to emerge. This year, not so much. It sure seemed like, this time around, the field spread out early–even as early as Tennessee Valley #1 at just under nine miles in–with the front of the men’s field staking early claims on right-for-them paces rather than a huge group of guys forging out together too quickly into the still-dark morning. There were a couple gentlemen who stood apart from this general trend, however, eventual winnerZach Miller(pre-andpost-race interviews),Tyler Sigl, and eventual third-placeRyan Bak(post-race interview). It wasn’t too surprising to see either Zach or Ryan out front, as Zach’s already carved a name for himself as an off-the-front racer and we’re seeing a similar trait in Ryan as he continues to develop his trail-ultra career. But Zach and Ryan managed to basically stay off the front to finish in their respective first and third places. Let me be clear, I think it’s perhaps impossible to watch Zach Miller race and not want to root for him. Not only does he put heart and soul into pushing himself, but he also puts on a massive show when he rolls through aid stations, kicking the pace up a notch or two, fist pumping the sky for 10 strides, and smiling ear-to-ear. The kid just loves to run, and the faster the better. While he had company early on, I don’t think he was actually challenged by anyone else for the win. It was only the course and running through the pain created by working so hard that proved to be today’s challenges. Zach Miller on his way to the 2015 TNF EC 50 Mile win. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I just had this feeling all morning thatDylan Bowman(pre-andpost-race interviews) was going to finish second. In watching his training on Strava, DBo has been nailing his long runs. The paces I saw him log 25- and 30-mile training runs at this fall made me almost sure that he could run 50 miles at podium pace here this weekend. Then, when I saw how comfortable he looked cruising in the middle of the top 10 for more than half the race, it seemed like it was only a matter of time until he unleashed. At Muir Beach #2 at mile 40, since he’s a local boy, him arriving in second place garnered loads of cheers. Dylan looked calm and in control from there through the finish. Like clockwork, his calculated, cool effort is another stair step upward of improvement for him on this course. There’s only one spot left now to step up to and he showed us all today that he is capable of the big W here. Dylan Bowman working toward second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Ryan Bak, dude’s got wheels and he’s figuring out how to use them for 50 miles. He said after the race that he hasn’t been training too much due to a new baby at home and being busy at work, but that he managed to put together a month-long, crash-course training block to build upon a modest base. And that was apparently enough to do today’s trick. The steep ups and downs may still be proving to challenge Ryan a bit, but the guy held his own in a stacked field. Ryan Bak near the course’s halfway point. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Moving on up, that’sJorge Maravilla. His fifth finish here today is his best, a fourth place! No matter whether Jorge is feeling good or bad, he always looks steady. And he always takes time to thank the volunteers and fans at aid stations. A class act all around. Like his friend, Dylan, Jorge looked even-steven calm while running most of the race right in the middle of the top 10. Jorge Maravilla getting a congratulatory hug from his son, Joaquin, after his fourth place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Ryan Smithsaid at the finish that his aging legs struggled a bit on the downhills of the Marin Headlands, but he looked just fine as he cruised to fifth place. This performance, a ninth place at the 2015 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, and the rest of his results amount to what has truly been a breakout season. Some said in the lead-up to this race that they thoughtRyan Kaiserwould finish well ahead of his just-one-position-outside-of-the-top-1o 11th place at Western States. They were right and he rolled through in sixth place after a later-race duel with Ryan Smith, and he became the third guy with the name Ryan to finish in the top 10 (and there would be another!). Two years ago,Dan Kraftran to fourth place. Last year he was 17th. It was hard to get a read on how he might do this year until game day as I know he’s been dealing with some physical issues. For much of the first half of the race, he ran at or just outside the top 10, slipped into it during the second half, and moved up to finish seventh. A smart race done so in quiet, confident style. If there was anyone who I expected to have a break-out day, it wasJustin Houck. After what appeared to be some step-up performances throughout this year, he just seemed primed. Early on he looked comfy running in the top 20. We first saw him inside the top 10 at Muir Beach #2, mile 40, where he was in eighth place. He maintained that to the finish. Allan Spanglerwho? Well, if you hadn’t heard of Allan before today, put the guy on your watch list. From Alaska, he’s come south to race a couple times of late, including a strong eighth place at this fall’s The Rut 50k. Between that and ninth today, I sure hope we see more of his talent. Ryan Ghelfifinished 10th for the second time, in his fourth finish at this race. A 13th, 10th, 18th, and now 10th again, this guy knows how to race this race. Notable drops includedMax King(pre-race interview), who said he felt the residual fatigue from a couple weeks of sickness,Alex Varner(pre-race interview), who wasn’t recovered from racing Quad Dipsea last weekend,Alex Nichols(pre-race interview), who succumbed to the plantar fasciitis he’s been suffering from for a while, and early leader Tyler Sigl. Full results. What a 2015Megan Kimmel(pre-andpost-race interviews) has had. I really hope she goes home, puts her feet up, and is pleased with what she’s done. After a DNF here in 2012, 10th in 2013, and second last year, methinks Megan came to win this year. While she hedged bets on herself during her pre-race interview with us, she said the same darn things in conversation before she tore up The Rut 25k in September, handily winning. Megan took things out hard and just hammered away the whole race, taking no mercy and seeming to encounter no issues that would let other women make up lost time. An impressive showing. Megan Kimmel, 2015 TNF EC 50 Mile Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Ellie Greenwood(pre-andpost-race interviews) may have finished in second place, but, oh my goodness, it looked like it was a struggle for her the whole way. When I saw her for the first time at Muir Beach #1, mile 12.7, her stride looked off, shorter and more guarded than usual. It seems like it didn’t really matter how she felt, she still pushed to eek as much out of herself as she could on the day. After running the first 25 or so miles outside the top five, she moved into it and up, little by little. She seemed so relieved to cross the line and sit down, and, to tell you the truth, I felt relieved to see her in a position of rest as well. Ellie Greenwood on her way to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Larisa Dannis(post-race interview) is on her comeback after a year or so of injury. I’m pretty sure she didn’t hit the top 10 until after the halfway point. After the race, she said she took things out easy because she really wanted to be able to run a couple big climbs in the second half of the race. And, wow, she did. After hitting the top 10, she only kept moving up until she had made her way into third place. I suspect more good things are to come in Larisa’s near future. Larisa Dannis is elated with third place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Fourth-placeRuth Croftwent for it, chasing leader Megan Kimmel for much of the race, and there’s really no reason to presume that wasn’t the right spot in the race for her, as she’s had some pretty phenomenal runs in 2015. While she slipped back to fourth place late in the race, she proved in a stacked field and with a fast time on this course that, as I overheard someone on the course say about her today, “she’s the real deal.” Ruth Croft after finishing fourth. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Emily Peterson’sname was dropped to us a couple times before the race as a local gal we might not know but who we should watch, and those sources were dead on. She looked super smooth almost every time we saw her, from the first aid station to the last. After her fifth place, I look forward to seeing what she does next. Sixth place was occupied byAnne-Marie Madden(pre-race interview). She may be new-ish to racing ultras–just a year into her 50-mile-ing career now–but when you watch her race, you know right away that she’s someone who is racing smart and within herself. Seventh place wasKeely Henninger, who has had a couple other stellar results in trail ultras over the last year or so as well. Jo Meekwas eighth place. I think Jo’s potential on a course like this is quite high, but she’s coming off a long period of injury, she’s been sick, and she just raced a stage race in Nepal two weeks ago. She lives in the U.K. so it might be a lot to ask, but it sure would be great to see her put in a focused block of healthy training and rip up a race like this here in the States. Ninth place wasDarcy Piceu, andAmanda Bashamrounded out the women’s top 10. Notable drops include last year’s winnerMagda Boulet(pre-race interview) andCassie Scallon. Full results.

2015 Les Templiers Results,"On a crisp fall day in the countryside surrounding Millau, France,Benoît CoriandEllie Greenwoodoutpaced their international competition to win the 77-kilometerGrand Trail des Templiers. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. While night lingered over the course, the men’s lead pack looked like a meteor exploded in the atmosphere leaving dozens of tightly grouped orbs streaking across the horizon before disappearing again into the darkness. Indeed, as the sky lightened, 15 men where still within 45 seconds of the lead in the charming town of Peyreleau at 23 kilometers. However, some top runners hung as much as 5 minutes off the lead while some lesser-known runners took it out hot. The lead mob at 9 kilometers. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Another 12 kilometers down the course at St. André de Vézines, four Frenchmen–Benoît Cori,Nicholas Martin,Lambert Santelli, and early pacesetterSylvain Court–andTòfol Castanyerhad pulled ahead of the field with Cori pushing the pace.Jonas Buudand another group of French runners were two minutes off the lead.Alex Nicholsof the U.S. was 6.5 minutes off the front in roughly 20th place. Benoît Cori at the head of the lead pack in Saint André de Vézines.

Behind him, Castanyer and Martin battled.Miguel Herassat in fourth not much further back. Court and Buud ran in 5th in 6th, but were far enough back that it was now clearly a four-man race for the win. Seemingly out of nowhere, Nichols now ran in eighth after having been in 15th only 3 kilometers earlier before a big climb. Tòfol Castanyer running with Nicolas Martin in Saint André de Vézines. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By the base of the race’s final climb at Massebiau (65k), Cori had a commanding 5-minute and seemed none the worse for wear. Behind him, Castanyer and Martin raced together with the Frenchman leaving the aid station a bit ahead of the Mallorcan. Heras was another two minutes back. The four leaders would remain in the same order at the finish. Meanwhile, Alex Nichols worked his way up into fifth after having taken third at the race a year earlier.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Where this year the men went out en masse at Les Templiers, France’sAnne-Lise Roussetmade sure that didn’t happen on the women’s side. She led by a full 2 minutes only 9 kilometers into the race and extended that to four-and-a-half minutes by 23k. That quick early tempo helped spread the field and leave the favorites in the top spots withEllie Greenwood,Jasmin Nunige,Maud Gobert, andJodee Adams-Mooreall around 5 minutes off the lead. France’sJocelyn Paulywas the only other woman significantly less than 10 minutes off the front. A mix of Americans and South Africans rounded out the top 10. Anne-Lise Rousset leading early. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By St. André de Vézines (35k), Rousset looked tired and the pair of Greenwood and Nunige were barely a minute back in hot pursuit. It was clear that there would soon be a lead change. Adams-Moore looked to be having a good time in fourth while Gobert and Pauly now ran close to one another in fifth and sixth. Jodee Adams-Moore cruising through Saint André de Vézines. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Apparently, Ellie and Jasmin would yo-yo back-and-forth on the course with Jasmin moving ahead on the climbs and Ellie gaining on the descents, but at the high ground of Pierrefiche (48k) the Brit/Canadian had the lead with the Swiss closely following. Rousset had given up more than 9 minutes in 13 kilometers to the leading duo, but she looked surprisingly comfortable in third as did Adams-Moore a few minutes further back in fourth. Ellie getting it done up front in Pierrefiche. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Greenwood took control on the final climb and descent to win by a small, but comfortable margin in her return to trail ultras. Nunige improved upon her 11thplace at Templiers from 2014 with her second place this year. She looked strong throughout. Early pacemaker Rousset fell almost half an hour off the lead, but that says more about the two top women as she still finished third. After finishing 10th at Les Templiers last year and sitting back in the early going this year,Cassie Scallonsurged late in the race to take fourth.

2015 Limone Extreme Skyrace Results,"Twenty-year-oldRémi Bonnetfrom Switzerland won the 2015Limone Extreme Skyracein a time of 2:45:25. Bonnet won the Vertical Kilometer the night before but that didn’t seem to stop his enthusiasm as he led from start to finish in this weather-affected 24.3-kilometer race. ItalianTadei Pivkfinished in a strong second place to seal the Skyrunner World Series Sky division championship in a time of 2:51:08. In third and less than two minutes behind wasManuel Merillasfrom Spain in 2:52:52. Spain’sLaura Orguéwon the women’s race in a time of 3:18:50 with a tight margin of 17 seconds over last year’s winner, Spain’sMaite Maiora, who finished in 3:19:07.Oihana Kortazartook the final podium position to make it a Spanish one, two, three in a time of 3:22:24.

Limone is situated on the northwest shores of the lake and by race day the weather gods had decided that we were to have a dry day. Snow was on the high mountaintops and as a result there were some course changes. Most notable was the inclusion of an additional loop adding some 800 meters of vertical gain. The race was now 24.3k long and around 2,800 meters of climb. As the athletes lined up in Limone’s harbor for a midday start, there was even a glimmer of sunshine. Fortunately, the sun never came out and so made the athlete’s journey just that little bit less arduous. A fast section out of Limone to limber up the legs led swiftly into a climb of several hundred metres. At the 3k mark, Bonnet had already pushed ahead with a 15-second lead over Spain’sAritz Egea, who would go on to finish fifth. Pivk was a mere 17 seconds further back and crucially keeping ahead of his Sky series championship rival Merillas who at this stage was lying back in seventh. Race influencerMarco De Gasperiwas in fifth at this early stage but his race was not going to go to plan as he would slip back out of the top 10. Marco De Gasperi early in the Limone Extreme Skyrace. All photos: Ian Campbell Orgué, looking strong on the climb, was less than three minutes off from Bonnet and already had a good lead with AmericanMegan Kimmelin second. Next was Maiora chasing hard and less than a minute further back was rising starYngvild Kaspersenof Norway. Limone defending champ Maite Maiora working on finishing second this year. Megan Kimmel running toward sixth place. With the previous day’s heavy rains, the course was muddy and slippery and as the athletes came in to the finish, their cuts and bruises were many. First across the line was Bonnet cruising in for a second day’s victory and showing how versatile this young man is in the VK and the Skyrace. Rémi Bonnet, 2015 Limone Extreme Skyrace champion. But the loudest cheers from the mainly Italian crowd were perhaps predictably going to be for Italian Pivk, for his second place had also secured him the 2015 Skyrunner World Series Sky division win. Tadei Pivk takes second at the 2015 Limone Extreme Skyrace and wins the 2015 Skyrunner World Series Sky division. Merillas had run a strategic race closing in on Pivk in the latter stages but just not quite enough to take second. Spain’s Manuel Merillas is happy with third. Orgué was made to work for the win by a charging Maiora. Seventeen seconds was the final gap between them, a little close for comfort. With Kortazar taking third, that made a Spanish triple on the podium. With this win, Orgué has triumphed in the Skyrunner World Series Sky division.

2015 Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji Results,"Lithuania’sGediminas Griniusand Spain’sUxue Fraile(post-raceinterview) outpaced the rest of their respective fields to win the 2015Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji, a 105-mile (169k) loop around Mount Fuji that features more than 27,000 feet (about 8,300 meters) of gain. With heavy rain before and during parts of the race, an already challenging course was made more difficult by slippery surfaces and mud. Despite two lower-altitude, weather-induced reroutes, originally thought to make the course faster, finishing times were slower and returning participants unanimously agreed that this year was much more difficult than previous ones. It seems, then, that Uxue and Gediminas used a combination of speed and toughness to finish in front. Since this also was the 10th race in the 11-race Ultra-Trail World Tour, Uxue and Gediminas, who werealready high in the rankings, leap to the front of them. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to UTMF-related articles and photo galleries.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks France’sArnaud Lejeune(post-raceinterview) rocketed off the start. When we saw the leaders for the first time at 11.5 kilometers into the race, he was two minutes ahead of any other runner and 4.5 minutes ahead of the main lead pack. When we saw runners at 31.5k and 46.5k, it was the same story: Arnaud was respectively 4.5  and 5.5 minutes up on any other man. Nepal’sSange Sherpatook the bait on Arnaud’s rabbiting, and he ran off the front of the main pack of men and in second until after 31.5k. Beyond there, Sange ran strong and calm all race long, however, he would slip back in the rankings. After chilling among the main lead pack for the first part of the race, by 31.5k in, Lithuania’sGediminas Grinius(pre-raceinterview) had broken off the front of that pack and into the third position. Though he tempered his answers to “How are you feeling?” questions, he looked wicked comfortable from the first time we saw him at 11.5k onward. Between the 46.5k and 69.6k aid stations, runners travel through the Tenshi Mountains, the race’s most technical and remote section. If you come out looking good on the other side, chances are, you’re going to have a good race. Gediminas came out on fire, and though he was 20 minutes off the lead in third place, it looked like it was a matter of time until he would take over the lead. At the 90.4k aid station, Gediminas arrived nine minutes back of the lead, but left just one minute behind due to a smooth transition. By the 110k aid station, he had vaulted into the lead and gapped the rest of the field by 13 minutes. That number steadily rose for the race’s final 60k until he finished some 75 minutes ahead of everyone else. 2015 Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji men’s podium (from left to right): Jeff Browning (3rd), Gediminas Grinius (1st), and Arnaud Lejeune (2nd). Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Norway’sDidrik Hermansenhas proven his talent and potential in shorter ultra distances, and in the first half of the race he looked like he would be a force to be reckoned with in his first 100 miler. However, in the race’s overnight hours, his stomach turned, he spent three hours vomiting, and he was forced to drop at 110k. Gediminas Grinius, 2015 Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks After moving back into second position, Arnaud hung onto that spot all the way through the finish. We were told that, a couple kilometers out from the finish, Arnaud was walking, unable to run more than a few meters at a time. Remarkably, he even walked the finishing straight and across the line. Talk about putting it all on the table. His hot pace was risky but ultimately successful. Arnaud Lejeune is focused on his way to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks AmericanJeff Browning’s(post-raceinterview) performance was easily the most pleasurable to watch. Jeff spent more than the first 50k outside of the men’s top 10, and he looked super chill there. When we saw him at 69.6k, he’d snuck into the last spot in the men’s top 10. From there, he climbed the proverbial ladder. The only question was how many rungs he’d ascend by the finish. The answer went like this: seventh place at 90.4k, sixth and 110k, fourth at 110k, fourth at 135.5k, third at 141.7k, third at 157k, and third at the finish. His intelligent pacing early allowed him to hammer the race’s final 50k, move into third position, and hold it. For perspective, Jeff was 71 minutes behind eventual second place Arnaud at 110k and just over five minutes at the finish. Jeff Browning celebrates third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks NorwegianSondre Amdahl(pre-raceinterview) executed a solid race. Early on, he ran with the main lead pack, but between 46.5k and 69.6k, through the Tenshi Mountains, he dropped back a bit. He came out of them in fifth but some 35 minutes back. However, at 110k, he transitioned well and, though he arrived in fifth, he left in third. He ultimately gave up that third position to the hard-charging Jeff Browning in the race’s final bit. Like Arnaud, Sondre looked as if he used everything he had to finish fourth. Japan’sMasatoshi Obara, who took fifth, executed a race very similar to Jeff’s. We didn’t see him inside the top 10 until 110k and from there he gently moved up positions until the finish. Japan’sKazufumi Oosetook sixth after running much of the second half of the race in the middle of the top 10. Denmark’sSimon Grimstrupand Sange worked together in the race’s final third, and they crossed the line in a tie for seventh. Ninth and 10th places respectively belong toKeita KobayashiandHiroaki Matsunaga, both of Japan. Full results. AmericanAmy Sprostontook things out. When we saw her at 11.5k, she led with Spain’sUxue Fraile(post-raceinterview) tucked in a couple footsteps behind. The pair had formed a gap from the main pack of almost five minutes. Amy would continue to lead until sometime before the 69.6k aid station in the infamous Tenshi Mountains. It was there that Uxue assumed the lead and held it until the finish. Uxue said after the race that the green trees, rocks, roots, and mud of the Tenshi Mountains reminded her of her home in Basque Country, so it’s no wonder that she had set a gap of 35 minutes between her and all the other women at 69.6k, after the mountain range. For the next 30k, Uxue expanded her lead to as much as 54 minutes. While that lead would shrink and then grow again to 70 minutes by the finish line, she wasn’t challenged. Her back-to-back second place at UTMB and win here in a four-week span is impressive. Uxue Fraile, 2015 Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks AmericanAliza Lapierre(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)spent the first third of the race swapping among the top-four positions. When we encountered her at the 46.4k aid station before the Tenshi Mountains, she said that she miscalculated her nutrition for the previous section, and hadn’t had fuel for 90 minutes. Because of this, when she next headed into the Tenshis, we wondered how she’d come out the other side. Turns out, not too bad. She came out the mountains in fourth and 46 minutes off the lead, but within spitting distance of second and third places. Second place there, Amy, was suffering sleepiness, so she took her first of three naps between there and the finish. Her sleepiness, probably incited by a head cold, took her out of podium contention. However, relentless forward progress eventually works out for almost everyone, and she crossed the finish in eighth place. At the race’s award ceremony, Amy said that she’d been issued a one-hour penalty for crew violations, which would move her back to 10th place. However, at the time of this publishing, the results still list her in eighth. Aliza said afterward that her race was a series of wave crests and troughs, and her experience became about managing them. From about 100k to 135.5k and once she’d assumed second position, Aliza must have been cresting a wave because she cut into Uxue’s lead by a couple minutes at each checkpoint. By 135.5k, Aliza had swallowed more than a third of her gap to the lead. Aliza Lapierre at 50 kilometers into the race. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks However, from there, she gave time back and was even passed for a time by Spain’sFernanda Maciel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Japan’sKaori Niwa. Fernanda said after the race that the first half was difficult for her, and that in the second half she felt much better. She and Aliza swapped positions over and over, both in the beginning of the race and at the end. Aliza would surge on the runnable sections while Fernanda moved faster in the mountains. Fernanda Maciel after tying for second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks After not seeing each other during the middle of the race and Aliza running some distance in front of Fernanda, Fernanda bridged the gap in the technical terrain between the aid stations at 141.7k and 157k, and put a small gap on Aliza. Fernanda might have been doubly inspired to move here as Kaori was in the middle of a late-race surge, too. In this section, Fernanda moved into second, Kaori third, and Aliza fourth. However, the pavement into the 157k aid station favored Aliza, and she was able to pass Kaori and reconnect with Fernanda. From there, Fernanda and Aliza decided to work together, and would stay as a pair until the finish, where they crossed arm in arm. Kaori rolled across the line a short 5.5 minutes later. Aliza Lapierre and Fernanda Maciel cross the line to finish second together along with Great Britain’s John Adams. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Fifth place wasYukako Takashima, sixth place wasYukari Fukuda, and seventh place wasKiyomi Kuroda, all of Japan. Amy finished in eighth position, but, as previously explained, it remains to be seen if she’ll stay there due to a time penalty.

2015 Ultra Pirineu Results,"More than a thousand runners took off from Bagà, Catalunya, Spain on Saturday morning to attempt the 110-kilometer course ofUltra Pirineu. They did so under fair skies and pleasant temperatures throughout. Both races saw tight competition for nearly the entire route before the two winners–Emelie ForsbergandKilian Jornet–made decisive late race moves. Their races were highlighted by two newcomers to the 100+ kilometer race–Mira RaiandZaid Ait Malek–who both finished second and two long-standing stars inNúria PicasandMiguel Heras. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Ultra Pirineu-related articles and photo galleries. (Leave a comment if you see great resources out there!) Thanks forSalomonfor its support in making our coverage of Ultra Pirineu possible. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The front of the men’s race was full of great stories. For the first half of the race,Kilian Jornet,Zaid Ait Malek,Miguel Heras, andMiguel Caballerospent time ran together, enjoying the company. After dropping Caballero, Jornet was alternately joined by Ait Malek and Heras until Refugi Vents del Cadí at 96km. It’s there that Kilian decided to make his move, and boy did he ever! On the climb to Refugi Sant Jordi, he put six minutes or more on everyone in a mere 4 kilometers. There was no stopping Kilian (post-race interview) in his return to his hometown race after three years away. He reveled among old friend, fans, and fellow runners, made GoPro movies of his trek along the course, and made the most of his day. Kilian Jornet showing his appreciation to the local crowd. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Zaid Ait Malek (post-race interview) hasn’t raced much this year as residency issues meant he couldn’t leave Spain. He made the most of his fresh legs in taking second in his longest race to date. He looked strong and content the whole way and is now left to consider which distances he’ll focus on next year. While Miguel Heras has had some strong results in Spanish races the past year, he’d not made his mark on an international stage in a while. That changed as he ran an even race to take third despite not yet being at 100% after his injuries. Miguel Caballero might not be well known in the US, but he’s an international-level talent who ran in fourth throughout the day in a race that had surprisingly little carnage at the very front. Zaid Ait Malek enjoying himself at the finish. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell A bit further back, gastrointestinal issues resulted in an early drop from Italy’sFranco Collé. That drop mattered as it opened the door for Canarian runnerCristofer Clementeto move past Collé in the final Skyrunner World Series ultra rankings with Clemente’s fifth-place finish. Despite Clemente’s strong effort, he was leapfrogged in the World Series byLuis Alberto Hernando, who held true tohis pre-race plansof running behind the leaders with an effort that would earn him the title despite having finished his first 100-mile race at Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc only three weeks earlier. Hernando had won the two previous editions of the race. Miguel Heras back on track. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Luis Alberto Hernando on his way to winning the Skyrunner World Series ultra title. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The women’s race played out very similar to the men’s race.Emelie Forsberg,Núria Picas, andMira Raiwere all very near one another for the first 96 kilometers, although they ran together less than the men did. Forsberg was always in or with the leader while four-time defending champ Picas came back from an early deficit to run with Forsberg more than Rai did. While the Swede hadn’t run this long in a few years, she was able to make a late-race move that quickly distanced her from Picas. Rai stayed much closer until the very last kilometer. With her win (post-race interview), Forsberg also took home the Skyrunner World Series ultra crown. Emelie Forsberg making it look easy at Ultra Pirineu. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Mirroring Ait Malek on the men’s side, Mira Rai (post-race interview) ran her longest race to date with great success. She held strong the entire race, to finish second both in Ultra Pirineu of the Skyrunner World Series final rankings. While Emelie often makes it looks easy out there, so, too, did Mira. Didi (little sister) Mira being her happy self in Gósol. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Núria Picas looked like she was working hard all day long. She maintained contact for much of the race, but dropped back quickly once she was out of contention for the win. Her quickly growing gap back from the leaders may have had just as much to do with her huge lead on the women behind her. A fierce competitor, Picas also got to show her human side at the event. When one of her young twin boys saw she wasn’t leading late in the race, he broken down crying. She stopped to take the time to console him. The finish, saw another side of the Catalana as she lead twenty youngsters across the finish line as she waved the Catalan independence flag. Her local pride was made for a celebratory rather than a downtrodden finish. The pied piper of Berguedà, Núria Picas.

2015 IAU 100k World Championships Results,"This year’sIAU 100k World Championshipswere run under excellent conditions on a 10-kilometer-loop course in Winschoten, Netherlands. Sweden’sJonas Buud(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) finally won the 100k World Championships after seven tries and four second-place finishes, whileCamille Herron(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) of the U.S. smoked the field in only her third ultra finish. Keep reading to find out what else went down. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. After the first lap, AmericanJim Walmsleytook off and blazed ahead of the field, eventually building a five-minute lead on everyone. Every lap he’d shrug seeming to say, “Yeah, I know this is way too fast,” but he couldn’t help himself. As tends to happen, a cadre of top contending men ran together at the front until each could not hold the pace. Initially, that group includedJonas Buud(Sweden),Steve Way(pre-race interview) (Great Britain),Jose Antonio Requejo(Spain),Vasiliy Larkin(Russia),Giorgio Calcaterra(post-race interview) (Italy),Huub van Noorden(Netherlands),Tatsuya Itagaki(Japan),Pavlo Stepanenko(Ukraine),Oleksandr Holovnytskyy(Ukraine), andRoman Gavryliuk(Ukraine). On lap two, van Noorden, Buud, Way, Itagaki, and Larkin formed the lead chase group a minute back with Requejo and the three Ukrainians a minute behind them. Calcaterra was quickly alone in 10th, although only 2:20 off the lead at 20k. Jim Walmsley shrugging it off at 20k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Walmsley continued to hold the lead mid-race, coming through 50k in 3:05:20. The next lap he gave up three and a half minutes to the other front runners… and although he kept his composure, it was clear that his run at the front would soon end. Indeed, between 60k and 70k, he dropped from first to eighth! Meanwhile, Jonas Buud and Steve Way had pulled away from the rest of the lead pack on the fifth lap, with Buud having a small gap on Way. Buud would keep on booking, while Way would drop out at 51k with a glute injury that had popped up a few kilometers earlier. Spain’s Requejo was moving well as he came into fourth place at mid-race, while closely followed by van Noorden and Larkin. Itagaki had fallen back to eighth while Calcaterra had quietly worked his way into seventh, just ahead of the Japanese runner. After being nearly three minute off the lead and a full two minutes off the chase group at 2ok, Spain’sAsier Cuevas(post-race interview) was already running in ninth at 50k. Ukraine’s Stepanenko and Holovnytskyy were still running together, but back in 10th and 11th with AmericanZach Bitter(pre-race interview) having moved into 12th at midway. Jonas Buud, Steve Way, Tatsuya Itagaki, and Huub van Noorden together at 40k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell With Steve Way’s drop at 51k, Requejo moved into third place, only 90 second behind Walmsley at 60k; however, he blew up on the seventh lap. Although still near the top, he had given up 20 minutes in 10k and retired from the race, citing an error in his race execution. At 60k, Cuevas was making the Spaniards look great as he was in fourth, just ahead of Larkin. Calcaterra was holding his relative position, but moving up as folks pulled from the race. Meanwhile, the Netherlands’s van Noorden was dropping back to seventh at 60k; he’d drop a lap later. At the same time, there were five new runners together in the top 10 (well, top 12, but all essentially tied for eighth)–Wouter Decock(Belgium),Jerome Bellanca(France), Bitter,Fritjof Fagerlund(Sweden), andIvan Motorin(Russia), all eight minutes off the lead. Giorgio Calcaterra moving up mid-race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Once Jonas Buud took the lead, it appeared as if the race was over. He was in control of his own effort and no one behind him looked close to as good as he did. With his long-term experience at the event and cool demeanor, he knew what he was doing. After four silver medals at the IAU 100k World Championships, gold would be his. Not a single one of his 10k splits was above 40 minutes and none faster than 37:40. In fact, his laps varied by no more than two minutes. Think about that. His laps 4 through 7: 38:07, 38:11, 38:09, 38:06. Buud is a human metronome! Jonas Buud 10k from winning his first IAU 100k World Championships. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell As noted above, there were some major shakeups from 50 to 70k. Way, Requejo, and van Noorden dropped out and Walmsley imploded. After that destruction, the race saw tight battles within the top 10. Cuevas, Larkin, and Calcaterra found themselves in second, third, and fourth, respectively, at 70k. None of these three would blowup. Cuevas would lose second position to Larkin between 80 and 90k, but would take it back on the final lap. Cool and calm Calcaterra outran Larkin by eight minutes on the final lap to take home bronze. Larkin would be fourth. Decock and Fagerlund ran together in fifth and sixth at 70k and 80k with the Belgian making the decisive move in this duel around 90k to take fifth. Fagerlund’s sixth-place finish would help the Swedish men take home team gold. Frenchman Bellanca was unphased the final 30k, holding seventh place throughout. At 80k, RussiaVsevolod Chudykovburst into the top 10 with Bitter not far behind. Five kilometers later, Bitter would drop with a breathing issue. Australia’sBrendan Daviessurged into tenth at 80k, but would subsequently slow to take 19th. Coming seemingly out of nowhere, Germany’sFlorian Neuschwandercrushed the final lap in 37:29, the fastest final lap of the day by a full two minutes, to take ninth. Lithuania’sAlexksandr Sorokinhad a rough last three laps, but benefited from the destruction ahead of him to take 10th. Early leader Jim Walmsley continued on despite blowing up; he finished 28th in 7:05:19. Asier Cuevas cruising with 10k to go. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results (pdf).

(He was wearing a white tank top with “Russia” written on it in red marker that faded away during the race, while the rest of the team had official blue singlets.)] From start to finish, the women’s race was theCamille Herronshow. Last year’s runner up,Chiyuki Mochizukiof Japan, would run with the American through the first lap in 42:20, but, after that, Camille was on her own. She would build a four-minute lead by 30k, seven minutes by 40k, and a full nine minutes by 50k, which she came through 50k in 3:24:45. That lead would be 11 minutes at 60k, and she’d hold an 11- to 12-minute lead until she finished in 7:08:35. In her second 100k, she was only 8 minutes offAnn Trason’sNorth American record. However, that speedy time masks the fact that Herron was intermittently puking for the last 35 kilometers, so there are big gains to be made if she can figure out her fueling the final third of a 100k.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Mochizuki would continue to run in second until the fourth lap when Sweden’sKajsa Berg(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) would take that spot. Berg would run the rest of the race in second, running a 15-minute PR in the process of taking home her second world championships silver. By mid-race Mochizuki looked to be struggling in third. She’d fall to seventh by 60k and before withdrawing from the race. Kajsa Berg on her way to taking second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Much of the rest of the women’s top 10 would set up during the initial laps. At 20k, Russia’sMarina Zhalybinaand Team Great Britain’sJo Zakrzewski(pre-race interview) were running in fourth and fifth with Sweden’sSophie Sundbergand Russia’sIrina Antropovatogether in sixth.Caroline Duboisran in eighth with America’sSarah Bardand Japan’sShiho Katayamatogether in ninth. Zakrzewski would move into fourth at 30k with Mochizuki’s fade with Zhalybina following. Antropova, Bard, Dubois, Sundberg, and Katayama ran in sixth through 10th, all nine to 10 minutes behind leader Herron. Things were relatively unchanged two laps later at 50k, just with slightly larger spacing between the runners. Most notably, Bard was running with Zhalybina in fifth instead of with Antropova and sixth while Croatia’sMarija Vrajic(post-race interview) moved into the top 10 in eighth position. In 2014, Vrajic had raced much more aggressively, holding the lead around this point in the race. Marija Vrajic after taking the bronze at the 2015 IAU 100k World Championships.

Herron, Berg, and Zakrzewski ran 1-2-3, while Vrajic moved up into fourth four-and-a-half minutes behind third place with Bard another minute back in fifth. Russians Zhalybina and Antropova ran together in sixth and seventh at this point, 90 seconds behind Bard. Katayama had moved up to eighth while Dubois dropped to ninth. Great Britain’sHolly Rushbriefly moved into top 10, but would drop at 70k for digestive issues. At 80k a lap later, things continued largely as they were: Herron, Berg, Zakrzewski, Vrajic, Antropova, Zhalybina, Katayama, and, then, Dubois. With Rush out, Croatia’sVeronika Jurisicmoved into the top 10, four minutes behind ninth-place Dubois. Sarah Bard mid-stride. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell On the way to 90k, Vrajic passed Zakrzewski and would continue on to the bronze. Zakrzewski would lose another spot to a surging Bard on the final lap to take fifth with a 10-minute personal best, while the American would finish fourth in her 100k debut. Zhalybina would be the Russian who held on longest, as she finished in sixth. Australia’sKirstin Bull, Great Britain’sSusan Harrison, and Sweden’sStina Svenssonall cracked the top 10 on their way to 90k, where they ran in eighth through 10th, respectively. Of the women in the top 10, only Bard (44:53) would run a faster final lap than Svensson’s 45:30. The Swede would finish seventh. Australia’s Kirstin Bull held on to eighth, setting an Australian 100k national record in the process. Amazingly, both Svensson and Bull negative split the second 50k. Russia’s Antropova cratered the final lap (53:59) to finish ninth, with Harrison holding on to 10th. Jo Zakrzewski feeling awesome early in the race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results (pdf).

2015 The Rut 50k Results,"Adding international flare to a Montana-style race, Italy’sFranco Collé(interview) and Sweden’sEmelie Forsberg(interview) used their respective technical-running prowess to pull away from the rest of the men’s and women’s fields at the 2015The Rut 50kand to pull ahead in the Skyrunner World Series ultra-division rankings. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Rut-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports.

The first 11 or so miles of The Rut 50k course are runnable–in a ski resort kind of way–with those miles spent on singletrack and dirt roads. This terrain favored the fast leg turnover guys, and the leader and pace pusher through both mile 5 and 11 wasMario Mendoza, with his friend and training partner,Max King, right there with him. Behind them, at both time checks, was a long string of 15 or so men, all at close distance. Franco Collé leading The Rut 50k at mile 16. Photo: iRunFar/Dom Grossman From mile 11, the course climbs steeply to the top of Headwaters Ridge, and then it makes the day’s most technical descent down that ridge. It was on Headwaters that ItalianFranco Collé(interview) and SpaniardCristofer Clemente(interview) applied their oft-used-in-Europe technical-running ability to surge to the front of the field. Franco and Cristofer are both competing for the Skyrunner World Series ultra-division title, and this season they’ve dueled each other multiples times. The pair ran together or within contact of each other for several miles, including up the long, steep, and rocky ascent of 11,000-plus-foot Lone Peak at mile 20. We saw the pair at both the bottom and top of the final climb of Andesite Mountain, at miles 25 and 26, and Franco held a 2:30 lead at the bottom and a lead of just over a minute at the top. Cristofer had surged the uphill, but Franco re-extended his lead back to 2:30 at the finish line, opening things back up on the final downhill. Rolling across the finish in respective first and second places, they greeted each other warmly. Cristofer Clemente on his way to taking second. Photo: iRunFar/Travis Trampe At the finish line, it was just 10 more minutes before third placeMatt Shryock(interview) came through after having put on a heckuva racing show. The American hung around the top five or six men for the race’s early, runnable miles. On the steep climb to Headwaters Ridge between miles 11 and 15, Matt moved up into third position, and held tight to it from there to the finish. While he was unable to challenge for first or second place, he was also unchallenged from behind for his podium spot, either. Matt’s finish, his third here at The Rut 50k, represents his fastest by about a half hour. Matt Shryock in third, his finishing position, at mile 16. Photo: iRunFar/Dom Grossman The rest of the men’s top 10 trickled into the finish another 10 minutes back of Matt, and it contained fourth placeMattias Messner, fifth placeEdward Farley, and sixth place Max King. Max, who ran with the lead for the race’s first third, said at the finish that the steep and technical sections just weren’t his kind of course, though he had a really good time out there.Luke Nelsonfinished seventh, improving upon his last year’s performance here by an hour, an excellent turnout for him.Allan Spangler,Gabe McGowan, andKyle Barrettrounded out the men’s top 10. Early leader Mario Mendoza dropped with a minor injury. Full results. It was hard not to imagine this year’s The Rut 50k as anything but theEmelie Forsberg(interview) show. She has to be one of the best, if not the best, female technical downhill runner in the world. While The Rut’s course mixes in a fair bit of non-technical terrain, what’s technical here is so severely so that it has shown in previous years to whittle the winning field down to those with mad tech-running skills. At mile 5, in the below-freezing pre-dawn, 6 women ran together, all bundled up in hats and layers, at what several described after the race as a chill and comfortable pace. At mile 11, these 6 women were strung out in a line, but still in close contact with each other. The pace of this group was pushed byAshley Erba. From mile 11 to mile 15, on the steep climb to Headwaters Ridge, Emelie said that the other women slowed while she maintained her pace, and she broke off ahead of that string of women. When we saw her at mile 16, near the end of the super-technical Headwaters descent, she’d carved a four-minute lead over the the rest of the field. Then, at mile 19, about a third of the way up the steep and rocky ascent to Lone Peak, she was alone and 9 minutes off the front. From there to finish, she ran unchallenged, taking her second-straight win of The Rut 50k on the heels of finishing fourth in Friday’s Vertical Kilometer and fifth in Saturday’s 25k. Emelie Forsberg on her way to her second-straight win at The Rut 50k. Photo: iRunFar/Dom Grossman With her second-place performance,Hillary Allen(interview) demonstrated that she is a rising star of American mountain running. In the early, runnable miles, Hillary was tucked in among the lead women. She would say later that she wasn’t feeling good then, or on the big climb to and descent from Headwaters Ridge between miles 11 and 15. During this time, she was running around fourth place. However, around mile 18, she started to feel good, and she was able to put herself solidly in third position on the climb to Lone Peak. And, on the final climb, between miles 25 and 26, she moved into second position. Closing hard and hauling on the final descent, she ate into Emelie’s lead, arriving about 4:30 in arrears. Hillary’s finish represents a 30-minute improvement from her fifth place last year. Hillary Allen with her head down in pursuit of a second-place finish. Photo: iRunFar/Dom Grossman ItalianMartina Valmassoi(interview) is well known as a top female ski mountaineer in Europe, and this summer she has been experimenting with trail racing. The Rut 50k was her debut ultramarathon. In the cold, early morning, Martina hung on the back of the six-girl posse before surging toward the front of the group on Headwaters Ridge. By mile 18, she found herself in second place because several women in front of her had taken a brief wrong turn. From mile 18 to the summit of Lone Peak at mile 20, Martina moved well, putting her ski-mo climbing skills to work. After the race, Martina said she struggled between miles 25 and the finish, however, over the last climb and descent of Andesite Mountain, because she’d not raced that long before. It was here that she gave up second position and moved into third, where she would finish. Martina Valmassoi running her way to third at The Rut 50k. Photo: iRunFar/Dom Grossman Kristina Pattison had a strong run from start to finish, seemingly tucked in just behind the lead women for the entire day. Her fourth place is 20 minutes faster than her sixth place in 2014. Anna Mae Flynn took fifth, andMeaghen Brownsixth. At the finish, Meaghen said it was one of the best races of her life, and that she put it all out there. In doing so, she ran a full 40 minutes faster than last year, the greatest 2014-to-2015 improvement among the men’s and women’s top 10 returners. Laura Tabor,Kaitlin MacDonald,Anya Gue, andKatie Frenchcompleted the women’s top 10. Early leader Ashley Erba dropped a mile 18 with a minor injury. Full results.

2015 Ultra-Trail Du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) Results,"Xavier ThevenardandNathalie Mauclairtook away victories at the 2015Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc. Xavier by working the rest of field to bits until there was no one left at the front but him, and Nathalie by simply being nearly untouchable from the start. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on ourUTMB live-coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to UTMB-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back! Thanks toFlorafor making our UTMB coverage possible. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The 2015 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc start. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein This is the kind of race that makes fans. Entertainment, stout racing, and a changing plot from beginning to end. You can’t not love our sport when a race goes like this one did. First, let’s begin with the guy at the front who ran out of his brains and showed us all the capabilities of the human mind and body. CueXavier Thevenard(post-race interview). He’s the young Frenchman who was at the front or with the front runners for more than half the race, until after the 100k point. He was the same guy who was still there when, runner by runner, the lead pack fell off pace. By the 124k aid station, he was all alone by several minutes. And he was there as the race closed out, setting for himself a different standard, building a big lead over everyone else, and finishing almost 50 minutes ahead of every other man. That is to say that he worked it, but by the time it was said and done, this race had worked him, too. On the final climb and descent, Xavier was quiet and a bit hollow looking, though he never deviated from his steady, forward progress. This effort marks Xavier’s second UTMB win. Xavier Thevenard, 2015 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein I’m guessingLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was bound and determined to finish this year’s race, after dropping from the UTMB last year past the 100k mark. In the race’s first half, Luis looked like typical Luis, there at the front and with the lead pack, totally calm, confident, collected. But the UTMB course blows just about everyone apart in some way, and a runner as talented as Luis is not exempt to this reality. There were times in the second half of the race–starting around the 96k mark–where Luis looked rough around the edges. The thing is, once you could tell he was straining to put out a good effort, it’s not as if his performance declined. In fact, for more than a marathon distance, he fought against the persistent attacks of the runners behind him–first from Seth Swanson and lastly from David Laney–to ultimately finish in second place. He had gas in the tank to rev the gears when challengers approached. Luis Alberto Hernando finishes second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell David Laney(post-race interview). Just, what the heck? And where can we all learn to close out our own races like he does? The guy is like a nice French wine in that he and most of them get better with age (or race experience in this case). Let’s just run his numbers. He was in something like 45th place at the half-marathon mark less than two hours into the race. And he wasn’t inside the top 10 until there was about a marathon to go. And he clawed his way over the race’s final climb and descent into his final podium position. With four kilometers to go, he was running just a hair in front of fourth-place Seth Swanson. In the end, the pair finished just under 30 seconds apart with David the victor. What a race! Wasn’t this chap an ultra upstart just 2.5 years ago? His 2015 has been insane, and he’s proven himself at many distances and terrains. David Laney cruising to third place. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein If I were a betting woman, my money would have been onSeth Swanson(post-race interview) for a top-five finish. Twice second at Western States, the course-record holder for the Cascade Crest 100 Mile, the slayer of mountain trails around his Montana home. Yep. Seth hovered at the back of the top 10 early, then made his way up toward the middle of the race’s top five by about the distance midpoint on the course. He held strong–and may I say both mentally and physically–carrying his body and spirit through the later kilometers of the race with lightness and what appeared to be contentedness, two characteristics that were missing in some of the other top runners whose faces had gone blank some 18 and more hours into the race. It was a true pleasure watching Seth manhandle the UTMB course’s offerings, and it’ll be an even bigger pleasure to see what he does next with his running. EcuadorianGonzalo Calistorounded out the men’s top five,Fabien Antolinoswassixthfifth,Erik Claveryseventhsixth,Francesc Solé Duocastellaeighthseventh,Ryan Smithnintheighth, andAlex Mayer10thninth andPiotr Hercog10th. [Update: July 19, 2016:At the 2015 race, Ecuador’sGonzalo Calistofinished fifth, and was honored in the men’s top 10 at the awards ceremony. On July 8th, 2016, the IAAF announced that EcuadorianGonzalo Calistowas serving a two-year doping suspension, beginning March 18, 2016 and ending March 17, 2018, due to an anti-doping rule violation discovered during an in-competition test at the 2015 UTMB. According to the IAAF, Calisto tested positive for EPO at that in-competition test. Here’sour article, which explains what’s publicly known about Calisto’s doping suspension.] Full results. Wow. This is a race that both met my expectations–I thought the possibility ofNathalie Mauclair(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) winning handily was very real–and turned what I thought also could happen into what definitely didn’t happen. I had also envisioned an intense battle for the win between Nathalie and her French countrymateCaroline Chaverot(pre-race interview) that would be decided in the race’s final kilometers. However, Nathalie set herself apart from the other women from not long after the start, creating a gap that no woman could surmount. By a half marathon into the race at the Saint-Gervais aid station, Nathalie had minutes on everyone else. And Caroline got injured descending a hill in the Vallorcine aid station at 151k, which knocked her out of the race. The duel I thought might happen was not a duel after all. Nathalie Mauclair, 2015 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein While this year’s UTMB was unusual in that there were very few DNS’s among the top athletes–almost everyone started who was planning to–there were loads and loads of DNF’s. Some of the other women’s heavy hitters were just never in the mix, or they sifted out real quick. But then, there were the women who put together bang-out races, such as second place’sUxue Fraile(post-race interview). Her racing attitude is one that many people could or perhaps, should, emulate. Chill, chill, chill, not affected by hype, other women’s pacing, nothing. In fact, her relaxed attitude rubs off on even me as I document her progress during races. Because this was a race with shake-ups all the way to the finish, I’m just not surprised that Uxue rode all the highs and lows and came out in second place. Uxue ran Uxue Fraile runs toward second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Denise Zimmermann(post-race interview), this year’s third place finisher, ran a tempered race start to finish.

2015 Leadville 100 Results," As a result of even-keeled efforts start to finish,Liza Howard(interview) andIan Sharman(interview) each walked away with their second win of the 2015Leadville 100. With Liza’s win, she marked her fourth Leadville finish and she also met her sub-20-hour goal by almost a half hour, and Ian finished in a time remarkably similar to his previous years, further demonstrating his 100-mile racing proficiency.

Though Argentina’sGustavo Reyesshook off pre-race teasing about taking the race out hard as he has in previous competitions, saying he was going to run having fun and by feel, he shot off like a rocket from the start. He arrived at the May Queen aid station at mile 13.5 in 1:36, which is exceedingly fast. There, he held a six-minute lead over the rest of the field. When the rest of the field turned up, it was the usual suspects ofMike Aishand Ian Sharman, as well as a couple other runners. From there, Gustavo extended his lead to 11 minutes at the mile 24.5 before starting to give some of it back. By Twin Lakes at mile 39.5, he remained in the lead but by less than two minutes, and Mike Aish was breathing down his neck. At the Hope Pass aid station, mile 44.5, Mike had passed Gustavo and assumed the lead by a full seven minutes. Meanwhile, at Twin Lakes, Ian Sharman sat 14 minutes behind Gustavo, and at Hope Pass, he was 12 minutes off leader Mike. At Winfield, the midway mark Sharman was 8 minutes out of the lead. The plot set-up for the second half of the men’s race was about as good as it gets in 100-mile racing. Ian didn’t waste any time regaining his lost time and by mile 55 he and Mike were racing together. Then, Ian broke things open, arriving to Twin Lakes inbound, mile 60.5, 6 minutes ahead of Mike. After that, Ian’s lead only grew by leaps and bounds all the way to the finish. Mike, on the other hand, crashed and burned. He said at mile 75.5 that he hadn’t been able to eat anything in hours, and that he had been throwing up. He later dropped. Ian Sharman, 2015 Leadville 100 Mile champion.

At mile 75.5, he was just a couple minutes behind Aish in third, and, at mile 86.5, he had moved up to second. His second-place finish represents one of the race’s best strategy executions.

In the women’s race, Liza Howard andKara Henrycame through the mile 13.5 checkpoint essentially together, with Liza leading in, and Kara leading out of aid. They ticked off 1:46 for first half marathon and change, quick given that the men’s chase pack ran a 1:42 split. By the mile 24.5 aid station at Outward Bound, Kara extended her lead on Liza to 3.5 minutes. Between there and mile 39.5 at Twin Lakes, Kara hammered, getting there a full 9 minutes up on Liza. Kara grew her lead to about 12 minutes by the climb over Hope Pass, but after that Liza began to gain back lost time. Liza Howard, 2015 Leadville 100 Mile champion. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks By the time the pair arrived back to Twin Lakes at mile 60.5, Liza had built a 7-minute lead on Kara. However, Kara wasn’t about to let things go. Kara gobbled back up some of her lost time such that, at mile 75.5, Liza only led by 2 minutes. It was any-woman’s game in the race’s fourth quarter! From there out, however, Liza built a bigger lead such that Kara was exactly 20 minutes behind at the finish line. Kara Henry is focused on second place at mile 75.

2015 UltraVasan Results,"In it’s second year, Sweden’sUltraVasan 90kyielded still faster times under perfect conditions and a slightly speedier course. That doesn’t take away from the course-record performances by localJonas Buud(post-race interview) or Switzerland’sJasmin Nunige(post-race interview), as Jonas had plenty of company early and Jasmin had a late race scare.

In 2014, Sweden’sElov Olssontook UltraVasan out in a blazing pace in search of the first prime. With Elov resting for UTMB there were thoughts the race would go out a bit more relaxed. Not so much. Seven men–Jonas Buud,Max King,Arnaud Perrignon,Helder Ferreira,Emmanuel Gault,Tom Erik Halvorsen, andMatt Flaherty–went through the 13km mark a minute faster than last year’s pace. The pace picked up as Flaherty edged out Hermansen for the first 600€prime at Mångsbordarna (23.5 km). The UltraVasan leaders at 13km. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell After Mångsbordarna, the lead pack shrank to four–Buud, King, Portugal’s Ferreira, and France’s Perrignon–with Norway’sDidrik Hermansen20-30 seconds back. This setup held until King surged in pursuit of the 1200€prime in Evertsberg (46.7 km) with Buud the only one staying close. While the American would nab the cash, his effort would set up Buud taking the lead and dominating the field the rest of the way. He seemed to put 20-30 seconds per kilometer on King (and the rest of the field), while continuing to move ahead of his course record splits from last year, a performance he’d considered one of his very best. Well, Buud has a new standard as he took nearly 17 minutes of his existing course record. King, Ferreira, Buud, and Perrignon just before midrace. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell While King held the sole lead just after mid-race, he never had more than three minutes on various third-place runners. By Hökberg (70.9 km), Hermansen settled into that spot and closed the gap to less than a minute at the final major checkpoint in Eldris (81.1 km). However, King pushed the final 40 minutes to hold off the Norwegian. Buud and King surging for the Evertsberg prime. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell A bit of a surprise from our end, Arnaud Perrignon ran with the lead group until Buud and King surged mid-race. After that, he ran in third or fourth the entire race. Late in the race he was caught by fellow Frenchman and ASICS teammate Emmanuel Gault who ran in as far back as eighth place at Mångsbordarna. The pair crossed the line together. Matt Flaherty taking the first prime. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Helder Ferreira and Tom Erik Holvardsen ran hard early before fading, respectively, to finish ninth and tenth. Matt Flaherty, who’d claimed the first prime, looked quite bad mid-race while holding tenth place at Oxberg and Hökberg. However, a couple on-course pancakes fueled a late-race surge that moved him into seventh. Previously-unknown-to-us runners,Jarle Risaof Norway andRanno Eralaof Estonia impressively took sixth and eighth places in a race where barely seven minutes separated fourth from ninth.

She had a two-minute lead at Smågen (9.2 km), seven at Mångsbordarna (23.5 km), and nine at Risberg (34.3 km). She built her largest lead of the day at 10-11 minute by mid-race.

The Swede continued moving up, but there wasn’t enough real estate before the finish. Nunige would win in a new course-record time of 7:02:35 with Nilsson less than three-and-half minutes back in her ultramarathon debut. Ida Nilsson running in second at Mångsbordarna.

Here was the 10-race La Sportiva Mountain Cup schedule for this year:  Men’s Series and Results With his fifth-place finish at this weekend’s final La Sportiva Mountain Cup race, the Jupiter Peak Steeplechase,Ryan Woodssealed the deal on his third win of the series. He used early-season wins at the first three races of the series, theHillbilly Half Marathon, theHell’s Hills 25k, and theTuck Fest Half Marathon, to put him squarely in the series lead. He next took the win at the sixth series race, theSutallee Trace Challenge. Basically all Ryan needed to do was to finish strongly at Jupiter Peak to retain his series win. Racing with a cold made that difficult, but his fifth place at the Jupiter Peak Steeplechase rounded out his series season and earned him the $5,000 payout. Ryan Woods at the Tuck Fest Half Marathon.

Matt’s third race in the series was a solid win of theDon’t Fence Me In Trail Run, and his fourth was a second place at theVail Hill Climb. Coming into the Jupiter Peak Steeplechase, Matt was in second, but there was a chance for him to upset leader Ryan. He gave it his all and finished second, but not far enough ahead of Ryan to capture the win. His second place in the series nets him $3,500. Bret Ferriertakes $2,000 for finishing the series in third place, which he earned through a third places at Hillybilly and Don’t Fence Me In, a second place at Sutallee, a seventh place at theLa Sportiva Table Rock 27k, and sixth place at Jupiter Peak.

In this interview, Maria tells us about what she thought of the diversity of races in this year’s series, how she stepped up her game from previous years in the LSMC, and how she trains for shorter-distance trail running. iRunFar:To get the LSMC win, you ran theHillybilly Half Marathonin Washington State, theDon’t Fence Me In Trail Runin Montana, theRothrock Challengein Pennsylvania, and theLa Sportiva Table Rock 27kin Cali. Phew! That’s some geography. Can you talk about the diversity of course layout, terrain, geography you experienced? Maria Dalzot:Phew is right! Is has been quite the year of traveling and racing. At the start of the year, my two goals for the spring/summer were to 1. Make the U.S. team and perform well at theWorld Mountain Running Association’s Long Distance Championships, and 2. Win the La Sportiva Mountain Cup. It was a grueling schedule, but to come out the other side having achieved my goals while staying healthy feels very satisfying. One of the biggest challenges with the Mountain Cup is figuring out logistically which races to run since they are spread out over the entire country and over six months. Adding a trip to Europe in the middle of it all was no easy task. Hillbilly Half Marathon is just a 2.5-hour drive down I-5 (to Olympia) for us so that made it very convenient start to the series in March. The course is typical Pacific Northwest, muddy and tree-covered trails. I ran Don’t Fence Me In last year and had a really great experience so we definitely wanted to return now that I had run the course and knew what to expect. I love the Northwest trails, but the trail system in Helena (maintained by the Prickly Pear Land Trust) is awesome; smooth, runnable trails with incredible views for miles. That was May and by this time I knew I was headed to the WMRA’s Long Distance Championships in Zermatt, Switzerland (July 4th) so we decided to fit in a quick trip to see family in West Virginia and jump into Rothrock (about three hours away in Pennsylvania). My main goal here was simply to garner some points with as little effort as possible since my focus was now on worlds. Rothrock is one of those races that you are warned about, but have to run it to see for yourself. They weren’t kidding; Rothrock is the most technical trail race I have ever run. The terrain was just rocks, rocks, and more rocks. I’m happy I made it through that one with just a few falls and scratches. After Rothrock I headed to Europe for the WMRA’s Long Distance Championships. Ten days after returning to the States, I ran the La Sportiva Table Rock 27k. Table Rock always has great competition and Inside Trail Running does a fantastic job hosting. This year did not disappoint! This race was the most fun I had at the Mountain Cup this year. Even though I didn’t win it was a blast trading the lead five times throughout the race withYiOu Wangand running 12 minutes faster than I had two years before. iRunFar:I think this was your third year competing in the the Cup, and your best performance so far, I believe. What has changed? Training? Other races? What has made you so successful this year? Dalzot:I placed fourth in the Cup in 2013 and 2014. I was battling injuries in 2013, and 2014 was a very competitive year. My racing success over the past 10 months is attributed to staying injury-free. I have been able to train consistently for two years now. Another big change this year was thatMegan Kimmeldecided to skip the Mountain Cup this year to focus on races in Europe so that left the door wide open. iRunFar:You seem to specialize in shorter to medium-length trail races. Can you talk about the specific training that goes into that? Speed and hill workouts each week? What’s your long-run distance? Maybe lay out a week of training a couple weeks out from a goal race? Dalzot:Right now I’ve worked my way up to running between 70 and 80 miles a week with much of it on the trails and with two to three mountain-athlete strength sessions. My long run is 18 to 20 miles. I do a workout once a week that can consist of either a tempo, repeats, or some fartlek variation almost always on a crushed-gravel-type of surface. Though sometimes I’ll do the workout on singletrack if the race I’m preparing for is more technical. iRunFar:What’s on deck for you in the future? The rest of this season? Next year? Beyond? Dalzot:I will be running theAngel’s Staircase 35knext weekend just because it is an easy trip and a great race hosted byJames Varnerof Rainshadow Running. It is also part of the US Skyrunner Series. After Angel’s my focus is on training for theUSATF Trail Half Marathon National Championshipsin Bellingham, Washington. That race was a dream come true last year as I won my first national championship in my adopted hometown. After that I’ll close out the year with theUSTAF Trail Marathon National Championshipsin Moab, Utah. To compete at the national-class level at the marathon, I still need to get faster at the shorter distances so I’ll continue training with that as the goal while at the same time gaining some more experience at the marathon and maybe start thinking about a 50k debut. Ryan Woods, 2015 La Sportiva Mountain Cup Champion Ryan Woodswon the La Sportiva Mountain Cup for the third time. In the following interview, Ryan talks about his struggle with the last race in the series, the Jupiter Peak Steeplechase, how he went about winning this year’s competitive LSMC, and whether or not he’ll return next year.

In this interview, Sarah talks about her background in running, what she thought of the series, and how her race went at Jupiter Peak.  [Click hereif you can’t see the video above.Click hereto read a transcript of this interview.] Matt Kempton, 2015 La Sportiva Mountain Cup Second Place Matt Kemptontook second in the Jupiter Peak Steeplechase, the last race in the La Sportiva Mountain Cup, which sealed the deal on his second place in the series. In this interview, Matt talks about the highs and lows of his Jupiter Peak race, his favorite race of the LSMC, and what else in running interests him. iRunFar:You were second overall at Jupiter Peak. But you were first to the top, so you got King of the Mountain. Kempton:Yes. iRunFar:You said before the top rocked you, but you had a couple guys, one a minute behind you and one 45 seconds behind you, and you managed to hold them off to get King of the Mountain? Kempton:I was doing everything I could. I was near puking to get up. I come from a track and road background, so that is not my element. I was at a complete stop for nearly a minute at the top drinking water. I was toast. But part of my goal and my strategy going into the race was I knew it was a long shot to take first in the overall series. If everything worked out perfectly for me, not necessarily for others, if I would have won and conceivably [LSMC leader]Ryan [Woods]finished fifth or worse and we had enough contenders, there was still a chance. Ryan is a great downhill runner as are a lot of guys in the series. Uphills tend to be my strength. My strategy was to get to the top first. iRunFar:And put as much distance between you and Ryan as you could? Kempton:That was exactly my plan. iRunFar:Did you at any point on the descent see him or was he out of view the entire time? Kempton:No. I was trying to keep an honest pace on the downhill. I looked back at one point and saw third place behind me and realized that I was going to have to, not that I wasn’t working, but that I’d have to absolutely push it. iRunFar:You had third place in the Cup knocking down your door, too, right? Kempton:Yeah, andBret [Ferrier]is a great runner. I didn’t want it to come down a kick finish with either of those two. I didn’t know if he was going to be the next one behind me or if Ryan was. Ryan and I have come down to a kick finish before, and he’s got a little bit better mile PR than I do on the track. I don’t want to kick against him again. iRunFar:So it was a matter of crossing the finish and then counting runners. He rolled in fifth, and maintained his series lead. Last question for you: The Cup in general is a pretty cool series of races. Every race is a different style. The geography is different; the climbs and descents are different. What has been your top experiences running around the country this year? Kempton:The most enjoyable race that I went to, albeit a very short trip and I didn’t get to enjoy the area very much, was Helena, Montana. They do a great job. iRunFar:The Don’t Fence Me In Trail Run. Kempton:The race director was very nice. I emailed her several times prior to the race. It’s a beautiful race, and they maximize their trails. That is a hard, hard course in a beautiful area. I would never have any other reason to go up there quite honestly. It was eye opening to the beauty that is in that area. iRunFar:Congrats. Second at Jupiter Peak. Second in the Cup. Going home with a little cash. King of the Hill, too. Kempton:Yeah, thank you.

After topping out maxed out, Matt stayed at the aid station recovering for about a minute, which allowedTayte Pollmann, who was running in second, to pass and take the lead. Tate gunned the downhill hard and arrived the winner, unchallenged by anyone between Jupiter Peak and the finish. Matt recuperated enough atop the peak to maintain second place.

Ryan Woods Interview Transcript iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar here, and I’m at the finish line of the Jupiter Peak Steeplechase. I’m with La Sportiva Mountain Cup winner,Ryan Woods. Hey, dude. Ryan Woods:Hey. iRunFar:How’s it going? Woods:Good. iRunFar:Congratulations! Woods:Thank you. iRunFar:Top-five finish today to seal off your victory in the La Sportiva Mountain Cup. Woods:Yes. iRunFar:You’ve run Jupiter Peak Steeplechase a couple of times. Woods:This is my third time. iRunFar:So you know the pain that’s coming when you’re standing at the starting line of this race. Woods:Yeah, you kind of dread it. I was saying earlier, I’m getting over a cold and my breathing isn’t that good. When you know you’ve got to climb about 3,000 feet in about seven-and-a-half miles, it’s not something that you look forward to. I was just trying to get out there and survive. iRunFar:You toe the line; you’ve got a cold; you’re trying to escape doing something that messes up your point standings in the Cup and staying in the money in the Cup. Woods:Yes, trying to finish. iRunFar:Yeah, what goes through your mind at the starting line when you know you’ve got to climb 3,000 feet before anything else happens? Woods:Well, at the starting line, I’m just super confident. I think,Ah, I’m fine. Cold. Here. You’re going to be alright, but it’s about a mile up when you’re like,Oh, I can’t breathe, and I’m congested, and people are passing me. Maybe I should just turn around and head back down the mountain. No, it was a battle up the mountain. I was saying earlier, at the scramble at the top where you climb basically on all fours in loose rocks, I got to the bottom of that in eighth place, and I think I caught about three people on it which was surprising because I’ve never been in the position in this race where I was around people in the scramble. It just seems so hectic. I didn’t think people really made up ground. It was kind of nice to get some ground. When I got to the top, I could just be in position. I could still run the downhills without really needing my lungs. I really put way the three guys I passed there. I kept the guy in sight for awhile, but I was really more focused on the people behind me than I was the people in front of me. So I just kept moving and just kept a decent pace on the downhills. Last year when I did this race, I was like 5:15 pace on it. This year it was more like 5:45. That was enough. It’s a blazing-fast downhill, but it’s long. After eight miles of it, you do start to feel the toes and quad. Everything hurts at the end. iRunFar:It’s a pretty amazing downhill. Like you said, it’s about eight miles and almost every bit of it is sweetly runnable, but when you put it all together… Woods:Mountain-bike trails—when you get the smooth curves, it’s very runnable. iRunFar:So you worked your way up and you had… Woods:First, I worked my way way back. I think I had the lead in the first mile—Ah yeah, this is good—then everyone just kept going past me and they’re having conversation. I’m blowing snot rockets. It was not… it was getting bad there in those three-to-six mile marks. iRunFar:Then you passed a couple people on the last little steep bit, and you’re a guy who’s known for your downhilling ability. So you must have sort of let confidence take over and just let it roll and do what you needed to do. Woods:That’s exactly what I kept telling myself. I was saying,Just keep them in sight. You’re not feeling good. This isn’t going to be your day. Keep them in sight so you’ve got the opportunity still in the downhill. Everything in my body was just saying,Turn around. Head down the mountain. Call it a day, but the ability to run the downhill gave me confidence. Even though I wasn’t as fast as I had been in the past, I knew I’d be okay if I could just get with those guys or stay in touch with them. iRunFar:The only guy who you needed to fend off in the cup wasMatt [Kemper]in second place. He was in front of you, it must have been from… Woods:He was a dot in the sky. I had a pretty good points lead on him. I’d won my first four races in the series, and I’d beaten him twice in them. In the Mountain Cup series, head-to-heads are very important especially after you’ve gotten some points and you’re in the top-ten. You get five points on top of somebody for beating them. It’s a 10-point swing in the series if they beat you. If they beat you, you’re five points behind. If you beat them, you’re five points ahead. Those two early wins I had against him made it so I could have a “comfortable-ish,” it wasn’t comfortable at all… iRunFar:Survivable? Woods:Survivable day today. If I had to race, it wouldn’t have gone well. It would have gone about like the mountain championships did last weekend. iRunFar:Talk about that for a minute. You’re coming off three mountain races in a row—the North American championships two weeks ago, the mountain-running championships last weekend, and now here. Similar style of races, but every race had its unique characteristics. After three weekends of mountain races, what are your thoughts? Woods:I’m tired. iRunFar:Are you ready for a break? Woods:I do a lot of racing back and forth. I don’t really train for peaks anymore. I’m 36, and I’ve kind of got this baseline that I can keep through the year. A lot of time I like to race my way into shape. The first race in Vancouver, I thought it went pretty good. It was two loops. The first loop was smaller—good climbing, good descent, fast runnable sections. I stuck with the leaders on that. Then you had a mile with 1,000 feet of climbing. I lost the leaders there. Then you had this technical section at the top where one guy caught me. Then you had a screaming downhill at the end. I nearly caught some folks on that, but the technical sections, when it’s new technical trail you’ve never been on, it’s difficult. I feel pretty competent on some of the technical stuff, but then again, sometimes I don’t. If you got some experience, it helps a lot. Again, the downhill was good for me there. Then the mountain championships, I was a little feverish. I was just trying to survive out there. I don’t know why I didn’t drop out of that one either. I held on and finished. You feel good finishing even if it’s not a good performance. That’s something I try and do, but I’ve got a lot of DNFs over the years now… too many. iRunFar:You’re now a three-time winner of the La Sportiva Mountain Cup. What keeps you coming back to this race series? Woods:Great travel. It’s always seemed to work out when there’s been two drives I can do, and then you’ve got three flights. In years past, we’ve made vacations out of those flights. Last year we spent about five days out here in Park City. This year we’re going to leave quickly because we spent vacation last week and then in Vancouver. What was earlier in the year? Didn’t make a trip this year actually on the Mountain Cup, but usually we make a vacation of it. There weren’t a whole lot of new spots on it. Moab has been on the Series before. New Mexico… a lot of really cool areas. Tahoe was on it years ago. A lot of cool areas to visit—that’s kind of what keeps me going and keeps me coming back. iRunFar:Do you think you’ll give it a shot again in the future or try something different? Woods:Yeah, absolutely. iRunFar:You’re kind of a La Sportiva mainstay at this point. Woods:I am. I have been doing different stuff. I’ve gotten into obstacle racing—Spartans and Battle Frogs. I’m trying to work out the upper body more now. It’s cool because as I’m slowing down, I don’t do road 5k’s anymore. I’ve lost a lot of speed, so I don’t have as much fun with it anymore. Trails, I’m slowing down a little bit, but in the obstacle stuff I’m still the fast guy. You’re training new stuff. I like to diversify. iRunFar:You’re keeping your mind fresh, too. Woods:Yes. New stuff that you’ve got a good energy in… I’ll do more of the mountain stuff but the obstacle races, I think, will be in the next couple of years until my body breaks down which might be sooner rather than later. We’ll see. iRunFar:Awesome. Let’s not jinx ourselves, shall we? Woods:No. iRunFar:Congratulations on your win of the 2015 La Sportiva Mountain Cup. Woods:Thank you.Saraj Kjorstad Interview Transcript iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar, and I’m here at the finish line of Utah’s Jupiter Peak Steeplechase. This is race 10 in the La Sportiva Mountain Cup. I’m here withSarah Kjorstadwho just won the race and who finished second in the Cup. Congratulations. Sarah Kjorstad:Thank you. iRunFar:How’s it going? Kjorstad:Good, really good. I’m just happy to be done. iRunFar:This is a tough race. It’s a 15-ish mile race that has 3,300 feet of climb that comes all at once. This is an all uphill and then all downhill race. Talk about how it feels. Talk about how it went out there for you today. Kjorstad:This race actually suits me because I’m not a super-strong climber, but I can muscle my way through it and at least keep the competition in my sights. I just kind of bide my time and get to the top. Then once I’m at the top, then it’s all… that’s when my race starts, when the downhill comes. That, to me, is easy and I take it fast and hard and I can at least catch, gain a lot of ground, and then put a little space or distance between me and the next girl. So that happened out there. iRunFar:I was up on Jupiter Peak and saw you up there. You were in second place with another gal just behind you and you were just chatting away, not even breathing hard. Kjorstad:So maybe I could work a little harder on the uphill. [laughs] iRunFar:Did you feel pretty good coming up that last little scramble there? Kjorstad:Yeah, I like that little scramble there. It’s actually kind of a break. It’s a little bit of a… it’s almost like recover from that solid, non-stop up. It’s something different. That scramble or that hike is nice. It’s just kind of a recovery before the big downhill. So, yeah, it was fun. There was another one of the women, we were talking about how the girl wanted the climb Queen of the Mountain more than we did, so we were just chatting. It was fun. iRunFar:SoMarta Larsenwas about a minute ahead of you topping out. She got Queen of the Hill. She got the Skullcandy prize for that. When did you pass her, and how did that go? Kjorstad:Right after the top. iRunFar:Was it before the next little blip? Kjorstad:Yeah, I just knew… like I said, the downhill is my thing. I knew as soon as… I could have probably caught her, but I just wanted her to get that. I really wanted her to get the prize, so I let her go. When I got to the top, I knew I was going to take her from there. That’s when I started racing, that peak and then it was all hard from there. iRunFar:Let’s talk about the Mountain Cup for a minute. You just came in second. What races did you do this year and how were they… what’s really cool about the Mountain Cup is the geographic and terrain diversity represented by the races. They’re all over the country and they’re all different styles. Kjorstad:The Mountain Cup is great. It works well for me because I’m sort of centrally located in the States. It’s perfect for my location. I was just thinking that my family lives in the West Coast, and there are a couple races out there that I can justify driving over for. This year I did theHillbilly Halfwhich was the first, and my brother lives in Portland (Oregon), so I went and visited him and did that race. That was the first one. The second one I did was the Helena (Montana)Don’t Fence Me In. We actually lived in Helena for a couple of years, so it’s home to me. iRunFar:Feels like home a little bit? Kjorstad:The trail system there is amazing, and the weather is always great, and the support is wonderful. I love that race, and did that one. Then I was thinking about theVail Hill Climb, but this year it looked like there weren’t as many people in the mix as far as the Cup went, so I could maybe not do as many races and just do three and still eke by into the money. So, I risked it and took the gamble and just waited until the last one to come finish it out. iRunFar:You had a great day here. Kjorstad:I did have a great day here. It was fun. I feel like I earned my place into that, into the money. It was good. iRunFar:You ran this race before. Is there… you’re kind of a local. You live in Jackson, Wyoming. Is there something that draws you back to the Jupiter Peak race? Is it that it suits your interest? Is it the terrain here? Kjorstad:Yeah, it is a great time of the year. It’s beautiful. I’m a summer kind of girl, so I love the weather. The course does suit me. I love that solid downhill and the climb is… living in Jackson, I feel I have an advantage with the elevation, too. It’s kind of at similar elevations. I run a lot of similar trails in Jackson, so I have that advantage. iRunFar:Everything is big climbs and big descents? Kjorstad:Big climbs at higher elevations—it just feels like it’s a good race that suits me. Great support. On the trail today, there were mountain bikers and hikers and every single one of them was counting what female runner I was. Even just random hikers with their dogs, “You’re number 33 and first woman!” Every hiker I passed—it’s such a great community and a great support for their local athletes and local sports. iRunFar:Last couple of questions for you. This is our first time interviewing you. I’d love to know a little bit of background on you. You’re a mom. You’re a physical therapist when you’re not being a mom. Kjorstad:I am. Yes, I am. I’m a physical therapist. I stay at home with my son though, full-time now. I have a six-year-old little guy, and he’s super fun. He loves to run, too, so I’m hoping that will… iRunFar:Rub off on him a little bit? Kjorstad:Yeah. He keeps me busy when I’m not training. iRunFar:What kind of racing are you into? The La Sportiva Mountain Cup is just short, grinding, really tough races with a lot of vertical. Are you into that style of racing or do you do other styles of races, too? Kjorstad:Apparently I am. iRunFar:“I didn’t know I was…” Kjorstad:I’m kind of afraid of trying to do… I’m thinking about moving into the 50k longer stuff. I’m just so used to going hard and running hard, hurting suffer fests. I’ve heard… I feel like the longer things would be harder, but I’ve heard they’re nice because they’re not as fast. I’m thinking maybe… I don’t know. That distance doesn’t at all sound appealing to me, but maybe it would be a nice change of pace from these “shorter” 18 miles. It seems… but you still have to run them pretty intensely. Yeah, I might try to move up to the 50k this year or maybe 50 miles. We’ll see. iRunFar:Experiments. Dangerous experiments. Kjorstad:I’m signed up forThe Rut 50k. I’m still a little nervous about it. For my first one it’s like an intense course. iRunFar:It is a “go big”-type course for your first 50k. Kjorstad:Go out with a bang, or go in with a bang. iRunFar:You’re a mountain girl and used to trails in the Rocky Mountain region. Congratulations again. Kjorstad:Thank you. iRunFar:Enjoy your victory lap around Park City. Congrats on your second place in La Sportiva Mountain Cup this year, too. Kjorstad:Thanks a lot. Related articles:"

The women’s race shot off the starting line at the Mount Bachelor Ski Resort base, located at 6,300 feet altitude and about 20 miles west of Bend, Oregon, at 9 a.m. The air was frigid and the wind whipping, but the sun was out and it was, overall, great racing conditions. The women’s race consisted of two laps on a four-kilometer loop, which sharply climbed 850 feet from the ski area’s base, had a quarter-mile-ish-long flat transition area at the top, and a screaming descent back to the start/finish. Since the US Mountain Running Championships is where the U.S. team is selected for the World Mountain Running Championships, the course was built to mimic this fall’s world-champs race. The start of the 2015 US Mountain Running Championships women’s race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Morgan Arritola, an Olympian in Nordic skiing, was the 2013 US Mountain Running Champion and the 2014 runner-up. This year, she took the pace out hard, and led aggressively from line to line. At the top of the first climb, Morgan had already opened a small gap on every other woman. By the top of the second climb, she’d continued to extend her lead. At the race finish, she was more than 80 seconds ahead of the rest of the field. Each time we saw her on the uphill, she was giving it with incredible intensity, breathing heavier and pushing harder than anyone else. And, on the descents, she was flying, but in a fluid and controlled manner. Today was the Morgan show. Morgan Arritola celebrates as the 2015 US Mountain Running Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Kasie Enman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ran the first loop in third place, clocking a 30-second deficit to the lead at the 4k mark. However, she looked cool and ready to go. On the second climb, she powered passed Kimber Mattox who had been running ahead of her in second, hammered the second downhill, and finished solidly in second place. In the previous three US Mountain Running Championships, Kasie’s finished third, 15th, and third, making today a super-strong day on the mountain for her. Kasie Enman would finish second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I can’t exactly callKimber Mattox(post-race interview) a dark horse. After all, she was last year’s XTERRA Trail World Champion, a race run on a short, steep and technical route. I guess a better descriptor is that this DI All American steeplechaser is a relative newbie on the trails, but the one we gave the best chance for success today. Kimber shadowed leader Morgan for the entire first lap, finishing the first 4k only 10 seconds back. She couldn’t hang with Morgan or Kasie’s paces on the second climb, however. However, her third-place finish was approaching a minute faster than fourth, so she held her own just fine against the balance of the women’s field. Kimber has a great future on the trails. Kimber Mattox runs her way into third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The final spot on the women’s four-person US Mountain Running Team went toAllison Morgan.

Full women’s results. At 10 a.m., an hour after the start of the women’s race, the men were cut lose from Mt. Bachelor Ski Area base. They would run the same 4-kilometer loop as the women, but three times instead of two, again, in mimicry of the upcoming World Mountain Running Championships course. In the intervening time since the women’s race, a bit of cloud cover built over Mt. Bachelor and began dropping a tiny amount of precipitation, but not enough to even wet the course. It was still very good conditions for a fast mountain race. The start of the 2015 US Mountain Running Championships men’s race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell It became apparent on the first loop that the race for the win was going to be a three-man show between eventual winnerPatrick Smyth, eventual second placeAndy Wacker(post-race interview) and eventual third placeJoe Gray(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). On the first climb, the trio was tucked in together, with a tiny gap on the rest of the field. At the finish of the first 4k loop, the bottom of the first 850-foot descent, Pat had a five-second lead on Andy and a 30-ish second lead on Joe. On the second climb, the trio regrouped, and this time the pace was set by Pat. At the bottom of the second descent, it was again Pat, Andy, and Joe in that order, with Pat sporting a respective 13-second and 16-second lead. And on the third and final climb, the threesome again packed back up, with Pat setting the pace. Somewhere between our observation point on the climb and the finish line, Pat broke, opened things back up for a third time, and won. Patrick Smyth, 2015 US Mountain Running Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Andy Wacker has been cleaning up in mountain running of late, and today was no different. He finished seventh the US Mountain Running Champs last year, so his second place this year demonstrates a marked improvement. He’ll surely be a force while representing the US at the World Mountain Running Championships this fall. Andy Wacker celebrates finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Joe Gray was the defending US Mountain Running Champion, and though he held his own among a loaded men’s field this year, he looked a little strained when we saw him during the race. His third place and 40 seconds off the lead puts him squarely back on the men’s 2015 US Mountain Running Team. Joe Gray on his way to third place.

2015 Eiger Ultra Trail Results,"The third annualEiger Ultra Trailtook place today in the shadow of Switzerland’s famed Eiger. In its 101-kilometer (63-mile) headline race, which boasts 6,700 meters (almost 22,000 feet) of climb, another stop on the Ultra-Trail World Tour, France’sCaroline Chaverotand Switzerland’sUrs Jenzertook home the wins. Read on for the full story on the women’s and men’s races. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Eiger-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back! Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. If you’re Swiss, you surely know whoUrs Jenzeris. In addition to a plethora of great longer-distance mountain running results in his home country, he’s participated in each of the three editions of the Eiger Ultra Trail. In 2013, he finished second to winner Iker Karrera. In 2014, he won. And now this year he successfully defended last year’s win. Urs ran powerfully and in the lead almost all day, after letting the early movement among men’s runners shake out. By 33 kilometers in, Urs assumed the lead, led the pace of the men’s race and fended off all the men behind him. Urs Jenzer, 2015 Eiger Ultra Trail champion. Photo: Alexis Berg/UTWT AmericanJason Schlarbwas Urs’s all-day lurker. At each checkpoint after the earliest, he was just right there, a couple minutes behind. It seemed that the pair accordion-ed with each other some, with the time separating the two growing and shrinking as they each worked through personal highs and lows and terrain that suited one or the other. However, in the end, Jason came up about 6.5 minutes shy of the win, arrived to the finish line looking like he’d given his all, and had set himself nearly 40 minutes ahead of the rest of the men’s field. Jason Schlarb on his way to second place. Photo: Alexis Berg/UTWT Portugal’sDavid Quelhasran most of the race in his final podium position, though he also spent a bit of time in fourth place. While he was almost 45 minutes back from the win, his strong running kept the rest of the men behind him at bay, and he took home third place. David Quelhas, 2015 Eiger Ultra Trail third place.

France’sCaroline Chaverotis suddenly winning everything, everywhere, and, in doing so, threatening many of the top men, too. Really, there was no other woman who challenged Caroline all day. She started off the front and stayed that way, and she soon worked her way well into the top-10 men as well. Her women’s win was also good for sixth place in the overall race. Talk about a woman who has emerged as world-level dominator in longer-distance mountain ultras. Caroline Chaverot on her way to winning the 2015 Eiger Ultra Trail. Photo: Alexis Berg/UTWT Andrea Huserreally brought it to this course through her home country. Much like the men’s race where Urs and Jason set themselves apart from the rest of the men’s field, there was a big break from Caroline and Andrea to the third-place woman and beyond. After a little early-race shuffling around, Andrea settled into second place and stayed there until the end, finishing seven minutes off the win. Andrea Huser, 2015 Eiger Ultra Trail second place. Photo: Alexis Berg/UTWT Italy’sFrancesca Canepahas raced all three editions of Eiger Ultra Trail, winning the 2013 and 2014 races without challenge from other women. Today she ran her fastest time by about 18 minutes, but the increased level of women’s competition meant she would finish third. Her race was strong and steady, and she held her third position basically all day. Though she was about 28 minutes off the lead, she was also the same amount of time ahead of any other woman.

For the second consecutive year, the men’s race at Hardrock was theKilian Jornet(pre-race,finish-line, andpost-raceinterviews) show. After running withAdam Campbellfor the first 30 miles, Kilian pulled gradually away from Campbell on the climb up to Handies Peak. By the time Jornet reached Ouray he had a 20-minute lead which he extended to just over an hour by Telluride. After a bit of trouble routefinding on the climb over Oscar’s Pass, Kilian maintained his composure and went on to run a counterclockwise course-record time of23:28:10.

Adam Campbell coming into Grouse Gulch. Photo: iRunFar  As expected, this year’s Hardrock was a two-woman race for the win betweenDarcy Piceu(pre-race interview), the three-time defending champ, andAnna Frost(pre-race,finish-line, andpost-raceinterviews), one of the world’s strongest trail runners. Frost started strong and looked determined in the early aid stations. She arrived to Cunningham Gulch (mile 9) in fifth overall, hanging close to the race leaders and built a 20-minute lead on Piceu by Ouray (mile 56). From the outside, Frost looked in control. To this point, Piceu seemed to be running strong and enjoying her day. On the 11-mile climb from Ouray up to Governor’s Basin and, then, Virgnius Pass, Piceu moved faster than Frost, and, by the time the paired arrived in Telluride (mile 72), she’d cut the gap to a mere four minutes. Anna Frost runs through Grouse Gulch on her way to winning the Hardrock 100. Photo: iRunFar Once night hit, Piceu seemed more comfortable. She took the lead from Frost, and opened a gap of up 20 minutes. Frost had a rough patch during the night. Coming into Chapman, she took time to refuel, lay down for a while, and prepare for a final push. Then, she came back from the ashes, charging forward through the night. Around mile 89, Frost regained the lead from Piceu. On the course, Frost shared, “I’ll go for the lead, if I don’t, I’ll bonk and walk for second.” In the end, Frost was the first women to kiss the Hardrock in 28:22:50 in her Hardrock debut with Piceu taking second in 28:57:09. What a great battle between these two amazing trail runners! Darcy Piceu runs into the Pole Creek aid station with a smile.

(For a refresher on the rules, check out thecontest entry page.) Read on to find outwho won the contest, and who did the best atpicking the men’s and women’s fieldsindividually. The WinnersThank you again toCLIF Bar,Inov-8,Flora,Julbo, and artistMaggie Tidesfor providing the great prizes for the contest. Without them, the only thing to come out of the contest would be bragging rights. On to the winners! We had a three-way top-line tie for second place with Clayton DeLosier, Rob Greenhaw, and Tom Welker each scoring 11 points. Incredibly, all three picked Paul Terranova and Nikki Kimball as the master’s winners, so the first tiebreaker is moot. More incredibly, both Clayton and Tom (Sorry, Rob!) nailed the second tiebreaker, the accuracy of overall winners picks. Clayton, you’re our runner-up by virtue of a coin toss.

2015 Mount Marathon Race Results,"Emelie Forsberg(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andKilian Jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) both took home big wins and new course records at the 2015Mount Marathon Racein Seward, Alaska. And, in doing so, they pushed the rest of the women’s and men’s fields into top performances. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Mount Marathon-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Check back! Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. The biggest news from the big (well, 3,022-foot) mountain is thatEmelie Forsberg(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) broke a longstanding women’s course record by running unchallenged to a 47:48 official finish time for the course, which is a little over five kilometers in length and has in excess of 3,000 feet of climb (and descent). The previous record of 50:30 was set in 1990 by AlaskanNancy Pease, who dominated the Alaskan mountain-running scene for years. Out of the gate, Emelie and local mountain, cross-country, and track phenomAllie Ostrander(post-race interview) pushed each other. At halfway up the mountain, they remained together, with Emelie setting the pace and eventually breaking away well before the mountain summit, topping out with an almost 50-second lead. Emelie arrived to the summit at 36:17, a new ascent record for during the race, too. Emelie used her technical-downhilling prowess to seal the deal on the women’s win–and the course record for that matter. She reportedly descended the mountain with a focused half smile, and by the time she entered the last section of technical downhill, there was literally no woman to be seen behind her anymore. Likely knowing the record was a probability, she gassed the final road sprint through town to the finish, her smile growing wider. Emelie Forsberg, 2015 Mount Marathon Race champion. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Allie Ostrander debuted in the women’s race, after winning the Mount Marathon Junior Race six times, including an outright win of the both boys and girls last year. In her maiden racing voyage to the top of Mount Marathon and back (the junior race doesn’t go all the way to the top), Allie raced to the second-fastest time ever, her official time clocking two seconds faster than the previous course record. The future looks bright for this rising star of Alaskan running. Alaskan Allie Ostrander taking second.

Christy Marvin, 2015 Mount Marathon Race third place. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Alaska’sNajeeby Quinntook fourth in 55:34, which was an improvement by about 40 seconds from her debut at the race last year. Alaska’sDenali Foldager-Strabelmade a huge leap up in her performance with a fifth place in 55:34; she’s run the Mount Marathon Race six times and this was a PR by just under three minutes. Aubrey Smith,Rachel Dow,Heidi Doner,Lydia Blanchet, andWendy Sailorsrounded out the women’s top 10. Full results.  Despite Alaska’s best efforts to keep the Mount Marathon Race’s champion an Alaskan, it was SpaniardKilian Jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andRickey Gates(pre-race interview), from the Lower 48, who trotted off with today’s top-two positions. Kilian Jornet, 2015 Mount Marathon Race champion. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci After a mad dash through Seward’s streets and up the lower couple-hundred feet of the mountain, which has multiple routes and typically splits the leaders briefly, Rickey Gates, Kilian Jornet, and AlaskanJim Shineassumed and shared the lead all the way to the top of Mount Marathon. Rickey Gates led for most of the way, though Kilian stepped up front briefly when he picked differing lines. The trio steadily broke away from the rest of the field, and had a full minute’s lead over anyone else when cresting the summit. Their official summit time of 31:29 becomes a new ascent record for the race–by almost a full minute! That’s what happens when you have a couple guys pushing each other hard. Rickey Gates on his way to second place atop Mount Marathon. Photo: iRunFar/Cody Priest Once they sailed over the top and headed back down, the trio stayed close for the scree descent at the top of the mountain. Soon, upon reaching the technical terrain on the mountain’s bottom half, Kilian broke away and put a full minute on everyone else by the finish line. This included taking his time through the streets, waving and high-fiving his way to the finish. He even did a full stop, turn around, and wave to the crowd before crossing the line in a new record of 41:48. The previous record of 42:55 was set in 2013 by Eric Strabel. A minute later and just one second over the previous course record, Rickey Gates came pushing across the line, fully spent, gasping, and wobble-legged. Rickey’s performance today was a PR on the mountain by eight seconds. Jim Shine took third just 15 seconds behind Rickey, and improved his time by a full four minutes over last year. We’d say the future looks pretty strong on Mount Marathon for Jim. Jim Shine takes third. Photo: iRunFar/Mauri Pagliacci Previous champ and course-record holder, AlaskanEric Strabel(pre-race interview), topped out on Mount Marathon a minute behind the lead three, and finished 1 minute, 38 seconds back of the winner at the end. Known for his ability to make up time on the Mount Marathon downhill, he made up lost time on Rickey and Jim, but not enough to surmount that one-minute summit deficit. (And no one could make up time on Kilian’s descent today.) British Columbia’sNick Elsonran a solid ascent and descent, sitting on Eric’s heels for most of the way, even experimenting with running in front of him a little. In the end, Nick crossed the finish in fifth, in his debut at Mount Marathon. Matt Shryock,Adam Jensen,Erik Johnson,Matias Saari(pre-race interview), andWylie Mangelsdorfrounded out the men’s top 10.

2015 The North Face Lavaredo Ultra Trail Results,"The North FaceLavaredo Ultra Trail(74 miles/119 kilometers with 19,200 feet/5,850 meters of climb) took place this weekend at Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Dolomite mountains of northern Italy. France’sCaroline Chaverotreset the women’s course record made by AmericanRory Bosiolast year by an amazing 49 minutes to take the win in 13:40. She had a tussle with her fellow French compatriotNathalie Mauclairwho led from the start but was reeled in by a super-strong Chaverot just after 48k. But Mauclair is made of tough stuff and held on for a superb second place, also beating Bosio’s course record by four minutes to finish in 14:25. Brazil’sFernanda Macielworked hard throughout, holding on to third place from around the 48k mark at Auronzo and finishing in 15:18. Caroline Chaverot, 2015 Lavaredo Ultra Trail champion.

FrenchmanErik Clavery, who had taken the early lead all the way through 33k, slipped back to as low as fifth, and then revived and fought his way back to an incredible second place in 13:01. The third and final place on the podium went to Spain’sYeray Duránwho was truly emotional on the finish line just three minutes behind Clavery in 13:04.

To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. On a mild night in the Italian Dolomites, 1,200 runners amassed in the streets of Cortina for the ninth edition of the Lavaredo Ultra Trail, awaiting the gun at 11 p.m. that signaled the beginning of an adventure amongst these beautiful mountains. In what seems to be standard practice in Europe, the pace off the start was fast. By the first checkpoint at Ospitale (18k),Erik Claveryhad gained himself a one-minute lead. British runnerLee Kemp, who eventually finished sixth, was next followed by a pack of runners around one to two minutes behind, including CanadianDavid Jeker, ItalianFulvio Dapit, FrenchmanFreddy Thevenin, another Brit (living in the U.S.)Nick Clark, and Didrik Hermansen. Mauclair had gone out strong and at this stage had a four minutes lead over Chaverot with Maciel a further five minutes behind. As they proceeded to Federvecchia at 33k, the runners were faced with a steep, 500-meter climb, but this did not seem to deter Clavery who emerged first but now with Spaniard Yeray Durán hot on his heels. Kemp was now four minutes down but looking totally in control. Incredibly, Hermansen had moved up three places to fifth and only six minutes off the lead. New ZealanderScott Hawkerhad taken that first section steady and was now moving up the field, lying in sixth place. Mauclair still led at this 33k mark and had stretched out an additional two minutes on Chaverot. But Maciel had obviously found this section tough and dropped a further eight minutes on second place but was now in fourth with French ladyClaire Nedelecmoving up the into the third spot. Fernanda Maciel would finish in third place. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell A steep climb to Refugio Auronzo was next and as the various crews waited for thier runners, espressos in hand, Durán was the first to stride through. A quick refuel by his efficient crew and he was out in less than 90 seconds just as Dapit came into the checkpoint. Three minutes later and we had a new third place with Hawker and Hermansen literally right behind him. In what was a trademark effort, Hermansen grabbed what he needed from his crew and was cheered out of the refugio within seconds, leaving Hawker refueling. What had happened to Clavery, had he dropped? No, but he had obviously found the climb up to the Refugio tough. He had dropped a total of nine minutes from the leader and there was still 71k to go. Was this the slippery slope for this Frenchmen? 2015 Lavaredo Ultra Trail’s second place Erik Clavery. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell Around 23 minutes off the lead man, Mauclair arrived still in the lead, but only just as Chaverot was now only two minutes behind. What lay next was a 19k, down-and-flat section to Cimabanche at 67k and it was where Chaverot made her decisive move to win the race. By the time she arrived, she had not only passed Mauclair but she now had a three-minute lead and it was a lead she was never going to relinquish despite some bad patches later on. The section down from Refugio Auronzo was also instrumental in the men’s race. Hermansen, who was fourth now, laid down the gauntlet to the rest of the field by charging down the mountain, displaying his superb race speed on the flat section. He took the lead by a clear minute. Similarly to Chaverot, it was a lead he was never to lose. Durán, Dapit, and Hawker remained in the same order although Durán looked particularly fatigued at this halfway point. Another 500-meter climb faced them as they headed toward 75k and the checkpoint at Malga Ra Stua. Hermansen was comfortably in the lead from Dapit but Durán’s fatigue showed and he had dropped to third with Hawker still in fourth with a 15-minute gap separating these top four. The race was on but little did anyone know that Clavery had revived and was about to fight back. Meanwhile, Chaverot had built up a four-minute lead over Mauclair as they came into the lush pastureland of Malga Ra Stua. It was now a question of who had looked after themselves and who would be strong enough to hang onto the finish as there was still a tough, 800-meter climb to get to the 95k point of Col Gallina. Hermansen remained strong and had increased his lead to 10 minutes from a now-fighting Durán in second place. Hermansen’s approach to checkpoints remained the same as his crew ran beside him, swapping over bottles. It was at this point that Dapit threw in the towel with a DNF. Hawker, who knew he was being chased down, took a phone call from his wife in New Zealand and moved out quickly. He didn’t have time to see then but he would see it later: a revived Clavery was on the charge and he was only five minutes behind. At Passo Giau and 102k, it’s a spectacular scene with the mountains behind the runners. Hermansen’s determination had enabled him to stretch out his lead over Durán to 20 minutes. With only 17k to go, victory was his unless something went seriously wrong. But for Durán, second place was not a certainty. Clavery had passed Hawker, who had taken a wrong turn, and was now nine minutes behind Durán. Chaverot was increasing her lead over Mauclair with every kilometer she passed and was well within the course record. The crowds at the Cortina finish became excited. Nathalie Mauclair at an aid station while headed toward second place. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell Didrik Hermansen was expected in Cortina any minute. As he came into view, he moved from side to side to high-five the fans and take in this wonderful moment before crossing the finish line. It had taken him 12:34:29 to traverse the course. He was ecstatic but calm. Erik Clavery had charged out early in the race, dropped back, and then revived when dawn had broken to work his way back up and past the field to take second place in 13:01:07. There were tears in his eyes as he crossed the line. It had been one hell of a journey for him. And as for Yeray Durán, he hung on, fighting to claim the final podium spot in 13:04:16. His celebrations were as if he had won the race, so celebratory was his journey through these mountains. The 2015 Lavaredo Ultra Trail men’s podium, left to right: second place Erik Clavery, winner Didrik Hermansen, and third place Yeray Durán. Photo: iRunFar/Ian Campbell We didn’t wait that long for the first lady to cross the line. Caroline Chaverot crossed the finish line arms raised and crowds applauding her achievement. Not only had she crossed the line in 10th overall, she reset the course record by 49 minutes in 13:40:34. Nathalie Mauclair must have found the final stretch into Cortina hard but second place was hers. She was greeted excitedly by the awaiting fans in Cortina. Mauclair crossed the line in 14:25:02 and four minutes within the old course record. Fernanda Maciel had struggled and then revived her race, picking up places and eventually finishing in a satisfying third place and 15:18:35. Full results. Full results.

It’s quite unusual that a 100-mile ultramarathon could play out almost the same way two years in a row given all the variables of a race of such a distance and composition, but that’s what happened in 2014 and 2015 withRob Krar’s(pre-race,finish-line, andpost-raceinterviews) two wins. Early in the race, both last year and this year, Rob ran chill, amongst the lead group of men. He did this until gradually the pack was whittled away at Michigan Bluff at mile 56. After Michigan Bluff, somewhere in Volcano Canyon, he made a move that would amount to a five-minute lead over everyone else when he emerged from it and into Foresthill at mile 62. From there to the finish, Rob put on a clinic, toying with the course record almost all the way to the finish. Though he ultimately missed the record by a bit over two minutes, he manhandled every part of the race, start to finish. The kind of 100-mile racing Rob does is, indeed, rare. Rob Krar takes his second-straight Western States win. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Seth Swanson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) proved that he wasn’t just a Western States flash in the pan with his second second place in a row, and his finish within minutes of (and faster than) his 2014 time. Start to halfway, Seth ran with or among the leaders, at times taking the pace-setting role. From Foresthill onward, he ran strong in second, fending off the challenges of anyone around him. With his performance, he, too, is proving himself among the upper echelon of 100-mile running. Seth Swanson kept it positive on his way to his second-straight second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At only 20 years old, third placeJared Hazen(post-race interview) was made to work all the way to the finish for his podium spot. After what seemed like a super-chill start, Jared moved into the top-five men for good around the halfway point before using the long descent down Cal Street to surge into third position by the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78. Fourth placeGemininus Griniuschallenged Jared for that third place in the race’s last miles, but Jared fended him off for good on the climb to Robie Point, the very last climb.

Full results. Thomas Lorblanchet , Rob Krar, and François D’haene racing in the lead at Robinson Flat. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Magdalena Boulet(pre-race,finish-line, andpost-raceinterviews) took her time finding her way into the lead, even extra time at that. After watching a few other women lead in the first 30 miles of the race, Magda went off course after Robinson Flat and lost about two miles of time. Once she found her way back to the course and learned she had a significant deficit to the lead, she put her head down until she’d run down anyone in front of her. When she arrived to Foresthill at mile 62, she was starting to build her lead. One-hundred-mile races are never easy, especially your first one. Magda said that the last 20 miles of the race were the most painful that she’s ever run. Her win was an example of perseverance after difficulty and perhaps stubbornness through pain.

PD: Para tener las últimas novedades de iRunFar.com al minuto,subscríbete vía RSSoemail. Es algo inusual que una ultramaratón de 100 millas se pueda dar de la misma manera dos años seguidos, dadas todas las variables que presentan tal distancia y trazado, pero eso fue lo que paso con los dos triunfos en 2014 y 2015 deRob Krar. Al principio de la carrera, tanto el año pasado como este, Rob corrió tranquilo, dentro del grupo de líderes. Hizo esto hasta que el pack gradualmente se fue desintegrando, hasta Michigan Bluff en la milla 56. Luego de Michigan Bluff, en algún lugar del Cañón Volcano, llevo a cabo su jugada que lo llevó a tener un liderato de cinco minutos sobre el resto al llegar a Foresthill en la milla 62. Desde allí hasta la meta, Rob dio una clínica, jugando con el récord del circuito casi hasta el final. A pesar de no haber alcanzado el récord por apenas dos minutos, dominó cada parte de la carrera, desde partida a meta. El estilo de correr 100 millas de Rob es, en realidad, poco común. Rob Krar se lleva su segundo triunfo consecutivo en Western States. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Seth Swansondemostró que no solo fue un flash en la Western States del año pasado, consiguiendo su consecutivo segundo lugar, y un tiempo apenas unos minutos más rápido que el del 2014. Desde el comienzo hasta mitad de carrera, Seth corrió con los líderes o cerca de ellos, en algunas ocasiones incluso llevando el ritmo. Desde Foresthill en adelante, corrió sólidamente en segundo lugar, escapando de los demás. Con esta performance también está probando que se encuentra en el escalón más alto en lo que a carreras de 100 milla respecta. Seth Swanson se mantuvo positivo, camino a su segundo lugar consecutivo. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell El tercer colocado fueJared Hazen, quién trabajo hasta el final por su lugar en el podio. Luego de lo que parecía ser una salida muy tranquila, Jared se colocó entre los cinco primeros alrededor de la mitad de la carrera, justo antes de usar el descenso largo a Cal Street para reaparecer en tercera posición en el cruce de río en Rucky Chucky, en la milla 78. El cuarto colocado,Gediminas Grinius, desafío a Jared por ese tercer lugar en el podio en las ultimas millas, pero Jared se defendió muy bien y lo dejo fuera en la última subida a Robie Point. Agregamos también, que Jared tiene sólo 20 años y un gran talento. Jared Hazen corriendo en Robinson Flat rumbo al tercer puesto.

Resultados Completos Thomas Lorblanchet, Rob Krar y François D’Haene liderando la carrera en Robinson Flat. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Magdalena Bouletse tomó su tiempo para encontrar el liderato, incluso algo de tiempo extra. Luego de ver a otras mujeres liderar en las primeras 30 millas de carrera, Magda perdió el circuito después de Robinson Flat, y corrió alrededor de dos millas de más. Una vez que volvió al trazado correspondiente, y se enteró de la considerable diferencia que tenía respecto a la líder, agachó su cabeza y corrió hasta no tener a nadie delante de ella. Cuando llegó a Foresthill, en la milla 62, comenzó a construir su liderato. Las carreras de cien millas nunca son fáciles, especialmente la primera. Según dijo Magda, las últimas 20 millas fueron las más doloras  de su vida. Su triunfo es un gran ejemplo de perseverancia tras las dificultades que se presentan, y quizás de tenacidad ante el dolor. Magdalena Boulet rumbo al triunfo en su debut en carreras de 100 millas. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Kaci Lickteig, wow, si hubiese sido una carrera de 105 millas, hubiese peleado por el triunfo. Luego de un calmo comienzo y de superar un momento duro a mitad de carrera, Kaci destrozó la segunda mitad del trazado, dando la sensación de tener el total control de su cuerpo y de su resultado final, dos de los desafíos más duros a la hora de hablar de carreras de 100 millas. Mientras afirmaba su segundo lugar, también recortó considerablemente el tiempo de respaldo de Magda, pero demasiado tarde para recortarlo todo. Ya en meta, se la vio totalmente contenta con su performance. Kaci Lickteig (verde, centro) haciéndolo parecer fácil en Robinson Flat. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell El tercer lugar fue paraStephanie Howe, quién parece que tuvo al menos un día parcialmente doloroso. Mirando su día desde afuera, pareció que durante la segunda mitad de la carrera su cuerpo no estaba de acuerdo con lo que ella quería hacer. En la meta, dijo que fue un día duro pero que estaba contenta de haber sido perseverante, y que había “rescatado” su carrera. También dijo que estaba casi más orgullosa de esta carrera que de la del 2014 donde triunfó, al haber sobrepasado un momento difícil. Stephanie Howe no pudo repetir el triunfo, pero si estuvo de vuelta en el podio. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell El cuarto lugar quedo en manos deAliza Lapierre, quien corrió de manera muy simple: se dedicó solamente a correr su carrera, manteniendo la cabeza baja y sin mirar a lo que pasaba a su alrededor.Emma Rocafue quinta, quién corrió bastante fuerte al principio, y se ubicó en quinto lugar en el segundo tercio de carrera, y mantuvo ese lugar hasta el final. En sexto lugar entróNicole Studer, quien corrió muy bien fuera de su estado este fin de semana, una circunstancia algo inusual en ella.Sally McRaefue séptima, y parece que tuvo su revancha con el circuito este año comparándolo con el año anterior.Caroline Bollerse llevó el octavo puesto en su debut en 100 millas,Erika Lindlandparece haber sorprendido a más de uno, incluso a ella misma, con su performance que la llevó al noveno lugar. Y finalmente Nikki Kimball, ¿Qué podemos decir deNikki Kimball? Su 10º lugar también trae consigo su 10º arribo dentro del top 10 femenino de WS100. Agregamos también que por primera vez en la larga historia del evento, una mujer de 70 años de edad ha finalizado la carrera,Gunhild Swanson. Gunhild finalizó apenas unos segundos antes del corte final de 30 horas, y la pista de la Placer High School, donde finaliza la carrera, se vio llena de fans alentándola mientras cruzaba la meta.

2015 IAU Trail World Championships Results,"Among a very strong international field at the 2015IAU Trail World Championships, France’sSylvain Court(post-race interview) andNathalie Mauclair(post-race interview) emerged victorious, and aided their respective men’s and women’sTeam Franceto team gold medals. Read on to hear how the rest of the race played out. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on our IAU Trail World Championshipslive-coverage page.

Photo: Kirsten Kortebein One of the things I love best about the increasing competitiveness of trail and ultrarunning is the dynamicity at the front of races, and today was a shining example of the pointy end of the field changing hands time and again. WinnerSylvain Court(post-race interview), of France, was always there, either in the lead or within spitting distance of whomever was leading for most of the race. Near the top of the first climb, at 16k into the race, he was running right around third position. Over and over when we saw Sylvain, he was hanging out ‘right there’ and occasionally even running in the lead, such as when we saw him at 36k. The final turning point, however, didn’t come until the final climb, after 71k. It was there that he finally put distance between he and the last remaining man. He left the 71k refreshment point basically sharing the lead with Luis Alberto Hernando, but put almost 2.5 minutes on him in 8.5 kilometers of climbing, a gap he would perfectly maintain to the finish line. The men’s lead pack at 27k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Sylvain Court, 2015 IAU Trail World Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell To tell the truth, it’s a little strange to seeLuis Alberto Hernando(post-race interview) do anything but win. However, second place Luis Alberto, of Spain, told us earlier in the week that his legs were still a bit fatigued from his Transvulcania Ultramarathon win three weeks ago. This seemed the case on race day, in that Luis was never super peppy and he lacked that that raw, animalian edge we’ve come to recognize in him. Still, he was a force to be reckoned with all day. Just like Sylvain, Luis Alberto lingered in the early hours, taking turns leading and almost leading with several other runners. At about the marathon mark, he lapsed to sixth position and about 2.5 minutes back. I began to wonder if he was going to fade. The wondering was unnecessary, however, because just 8k later, he’d assumed second position. When we saw him at 65k and 71k, he was leading by a minute margin and few-second margin, respectively. Here it seemed he was trying to make a break, but it didn’t stick. When we next saw Luis Alberto at 79.5k, at the top of the last climb, he’d fallen into second position, where he would stay. Luis Alberto Hernando racing at the marathon mark. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sPatrick Bringer(post-race interview) really brought it with his third-place finish. In the early part of the race, Patrick ran outside of the men’s top 10, lingering between 10th and 13th places. It wasn’t until after halfway that he started plowing his way through the field. At 50k, he’d moved into seventh and it looked like he was toying with the tough climb at Col de la Forclaz, like it was an easy game for him. Then, at the top of the next climb, at 58k, Patrick was in fourth. He assumed third position after 71k whenSebastien Spehler, who had been running in front of him, dropped from the race. Patrick Bringer climbing at 50k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Fourth placeTom Owens, of Great Britain, was the move-up man, much like Patrick Bringer. Tom and Patrick were running a similar pace for the first half of the race, just outside the top 10. In the race’s second half, Tom slowly clawed his way forward in the pack, saying at the finish that this was a result of him not feeling too great early on, and feeling better and better as the race progressed. During the final climb between 71k and 79.5k, Tom found and stuck to fourth place. France’sLudovic Pommeretemployed the same strategy as Patrick and Tom to bring home his fifth place, though he got aggressive about starting to move up positions earlier in the race, maybe just a third of the way in. The United States’sAlex Nichols(pre-race interview) gets my hat tip for the most well-played race. What do you think of this? Forty-first place at 8k, 29th place at 18k, 21st place at 33k, 17th at 44k, 12th at 50k, 10th at 58k, still 10th at 71k, then–wait for it–sixth at 79.5k, before finishing sixth overall. Dude, that’s a heckuva race. France’sNicolas Martinwas seventh, France’sXavier Thévenardeighth, Iceland’sThorbergur Jonssonninth, and Norway’sDidrik Hermansen10th. Full results. As per IAU rules, teams bringing more than six athletes have to choose the six who are eligible to help score team points before the race.Team Francechose to not include Xavier Thévenard,Benoit Cori, and Ludovic Pommeret on their potential scorers’ list. So scoring came from the times of top-three finishers on France’s list of potential scorers, meaning individual winner Sylvain Court (8:15:38), third place Patrick Bringer (8:21:43), and seventh place Nicolas Martin (8:41:01). Despite not being able to count some of their top finishers, the team came out with a large-margin win for the team gold medal. Early in the race, it was looking as ifTeam United Statesmight not be in medal contention at all, because Team France and Team Spain were dominating. However, patience pays off and it certainly did for this group. Alex Nichols’s sixth place (8:38:15) was the top American finish, withDavid Laney’s12th (9:02:44) andAlex Varner’s(pre-race interview) 18th place (9:21:00) being the balance of the Team USA scorers. Early-race leaderTim Tollefsondropped from the race with a foot injury. The team bronze medal goes toTeam Great Britain, which was led by Tom Owens’s fourth place (8:26:23),Kim Collison’s20th place (9:22:02), andLee Kemp’s27th place (9:37:32). Team Spainfell out of medal contention after being in the game earlier, due to drops among their front runners; they finished fourth. Full results. Holy smokes did the French women take the race out hard! From the get go, it wasAnne-Lise Rousset,Caroline Chaverot(post-race interview), andNathalie Mauclair(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) pushing the up-front pace. By just 8k into the race, the trio had set themselves apart by a minute from the field. Another 10k later, they were 5.5 minutes off the rest of the pack. And, at 27k, the threesome was very close together and eight minutes ahead of all the other women. Anne-Lise Rousset and Nathalie Mauclair running together at 27k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Nathalie Mauclair, 2015 IAU Trail World Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell From there, the pack splintered. At 36k, Caroline was in the lead by 3.5 minutes, with Nathalie second and Anne-Lise now six minutes back. At 42.5k, it was the same story: Caroline off the front, Nathalie chasing, and Anne-Lise solidly in third. The race would stay this way until the descent between 65k and 71k, where Nathalie ate into all but about 45 seconds of Caroline’s three-minute lead. It was not long after, at the beginning of the last long climb to Mont Baron at 79.5k, in which Nathalie took over and held onto the women’s lead. What a powerhouse she is, and this win makes two in a row for her at the 2013 and 2015 IAU Trail World Championships. (The event his held every two years.) Early leader Anne-Lise would go on to finish fourth. Caroline Chaverot climbing at 58k. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Spain’sMaite Maiora(post-race interview) ran the first half of the race in fourth place, then wedged her way up into third place when Anne-Lise slowed and she stayed strong. Maite said about 10 days ago that she has a fracture in her tibial plateau from a fall while training, but she started and finished this race. For most of the race, she looked as if she was running normally and without pain, but at the top of the last climb at 79k, she was favoring her injured leg quite heavily. Strong performance aside, I sure hope Maite’s health wasn’t compromised for it. Maite Maiora running into town at 71k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Count Switzerland’sAndrea Huseramong the women who started more slowly and finished strong, running a smart race. Her fifth place was a result of running outside the top 10 until after the marathon mark, running into ninth by 50k, then seventh at 58k, sixth place at 61k, and fifth place at 79.5k. Sixth place, Spain’sUxue Fraile(pre-race interview), also ran a smart race. She, too, was outside the women’s top 10, until she snuck her way in by the 50k point and just kept moving up in places. France’sMaud Gobert, who was the 2011 IAU Trail World Champion, finished seventh, Sweden’sMimmi Kotkaeighth, the Czech Republic’sAnna Strakovaninth, and Spain’sTeresa Nimes10th. AmericansCassie Scallon,Krissy Moehl, andAmy Rusieckifinished respectively in 12th, 20th, and 48th. Full results. As in the men’s race,Team Francewas the runaway victor in the women’s team race. Also like the men’s French team, several top-finishing women were left off the list of potential scorers due to IAU rules which required teams to choose six potentially scoring women ahead of the race. This meant that the scores ofJuliette Benedicto, Anne-Lise Rousset, andSylvaine Cussotwould not count toward the team performance. So the scoring came from Nathalie Mauclair’s win (9:30:59), Caroline Chaverot’s second place (9:33:21), and Maud Gobert’s seventh place (10:33:25). Again like the men’s team, despite not being able to count one of their top finishers, Team France won team gold without challenge. As expected, women’sTeam Spaincompeted well, with Maite Maiora’s third place (9:39:36), Uxue Fraile’s sixth place (10:25:25), and Teresa Nimes’s 10th place (10:55:46) leading them to a team silver medal. WithTeam Italy, it seems that conservative running paid off. They finished with a team bronze medal courtesy ofLisa Borzani’s11th place (10:59:02),Sonia Glarey’s13th place (11:01:38), andVirginia Oliveri’s29th place (11:38:56). Full results.

Let us begin with this fact: There were 10 men within three minutes at the race’s halfway point. Now, we present you with another: At 28k, it was half of that group still within minutes and all of the top 10 within 12. Okay, just one more: With five kilometers to go, three men were running together, still. Tight race, tape to tape. Ionut Zinca, a Romanian who lives in Spain and who finished fourth in a super-fast time last year, played rabbit for the race’s first half. He was leading at 16 kilometers in and also when we saw him at 20k. However, by the 23k Aizkorri high point, Ionut had been engulfed by several men. Tadei Pivk, Kilian Jornet, and Pere Rullán racing third, fourth, and fifth at 20k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell At the 16k Aratz summit, eventual winnerTadei Pivk(post-race interview), of Italy, was sitting in sixth place and a couple minutes back from the lead. Literally right in front of him, however, were two other key players, Spain’sPere RullánandManuel Merillas. This trio, the race’s eventual podium, would hang in close proximity to each other–we’re talking seconds, basically–from this point all the way to the finish. At 20k, after the descent from Aratz and before beginning the climb to Aizkorri, they were third, fifth, and seventh, respectively. Then at the Aizkorri top, at 23k, they were in about the same positions, but Tadei had gapped the other two by about a minute. At 28k, they were basically together again, and at 37k, they definitely were. In that last 5k, Tadei put 30 seconds on second place Manuel and 90 seconds on third-place Pere to become the men’s 2015 champion. What a battle! As this was the Skyrunning Continental Championships, Tadei was crowned the Sky category European champion. Tadei Pivk, 2015 Zegama Marathon champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Aritz Egea(pre-race interview) ran in second place for a good chunk of the race before he was passed and gapped by the lead men. In the end, he finished some eight minutes off the lead in fourth. Still, he met his goal of finishing as the top Basque runner. Manuel Merillas on his way to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Italy’sMarco De Gasperiran the second-fastest time in Zegama history last year, making him a huge threat this time around. Every time we saw him, at 16k, 20k, 23k, and 28k, he was in the thick of things, right around the middle of the top-10 men. He finished fifth. Sixth place was Spain’sJessed Hernandez, seventh was France’sMichel Lanne, eighth wasZaid Ait Malek(a Moroccan living in Spain) (pre-race interview), ninth was Ionut Zinca who flagged some from his early aggression, and 10th was Spain’sHassan Ait Chaou. Pere Rullán celebrates finishing third. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sKilian Jornet, a late entrant into the race, was among the top runners–and even leading at 23k–until after the 28k Andraitz summit. After that, he faced some stomach problems–we understand them to be residual from his time in Nepal–and slowed. He eventually finished in 22nd place, even though he probably arrived to the outskirts of Zegama inside the top 10. He stopped to shake hands with pretty much anyone who wanted to meet him on his way to the finish line. Smiles and an upset stomach… sums up Kilian Jornet’s 2015 Zegama. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. Oh, wow, what a women’s race! Spain’sOihana Kortazarwas definitely the aggressive pace-setter for the race’s first half. We saw her leading a tight group of absolutely charging women at 16 kilometers, 20k, and 23k. The two-time Zegama champion has one of the fastest women’s times on the course, and it’s easy to see why when you see her race, wicked-fierce ascending and pounding out the technical stuff like it’s a Sunday stroll. However, though she was in what looked like attack mode for the race’s first half, she had a whole pile of women in tow. After 23k, at the summit of Aizkorri, what follows is a super-technical ridge traverse and descent, and it was on that descent that championAzara García(post-race interview), a rising star of European mountain running from Spain, took over the lead for good. Each time we saw Azara prior to 23k, she was just on Oihana’s heels. After the race she said she had a hard time in the middle part of the race, but it was on that descent after 23k that she felt better and was able to race her hardest. From that descent to the marathon-distance finish line, she carved a small but meaningful-enough lead over the rest of the women’s field, thereby becoming the women’s champion in her first time at Zegama. For her effort, Azara was also crowned the European champion in the Skyrunning Continental Championships Sky category. Azara García, 2015 Zegama Marathon champion.

At 23k, however, atop the Aizkorri summit, Paula was essentially together with Oihana and Azara, not behind them anymore. At 28k, at the top of the last climb of Andraitz, Paula had placed herself solidly in second, where she would eventually finish. Paula Cabrerizo finishing in second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell. Oihana Kortazar, though she wasn’t able to keep her aggressive leadership position, did not fade away, finishing a very close third place, just a minute off second and three total minutes from the win.

Early in the race, she ran in the back half of the women’s top 10, though she was never more than a couple minutes behind the lead. However, little by little, she moved up positions, into fifth place by 20k and fourth at 23k. From there, she held well onto fourth place, where she finished. Italy’sFederica Boifavawins the award for the most animal-like, crazy approach to the day. Whoa was she pushing herself each time we saw her, leaning hard into the ascents, head almost between her knees! She ran in the middle part of the women’s top 10 all day, eventually finishing in fifth. Federica Boifava would go on to finish fifth.

El italiano Tadei Pivk y la española Azara Garcia fueron las estrellas del día, siendo los más veloces a través del ventoso, lluvioso, montañoso y embarrado circuito de laMaratón Zegama-Aizkorri2015. Como siempre, estaremos actualizando este articulo con resultados adicionales como también enlaces a articulos relacionados, galerías de imágenes y relatos de carrera de Zegama.

Ahora, les presento otro más: A los 28k, la mitad de ese grupo seguía separada por minutos y todo el top 10 por 12 minutos. Okay, sólo uno más: A sólo cinco kilómetros de la meta, los tres líderes aún seguían juntos. Carrera apretada, palmo a palmo. Ionut Zinca, Rumano que vive en España y que termino cuarto con un tiempo super rápido el año pasado, fue la liebre en la primer mitad. Lideraba al paso de los 16k y también cuando lo vimos a los 20k. Sin embargo, en el punto alto del Aizkorri tras 23k, Ionut había sido sobrepasado por varios hombres. Tadei Pivk, Kilian Jornet y Pere Rullan en tercero, cuarto y quinto lugar en el km 20. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell En la cumbre del Aratz tras 16k de carrera, el eventual ganadorTadei Pivk(entrevista post carrera) de Italia se encontraba cómodo en el sexto lugar y a un par de minutos de la punta. Sin embargo, literalmente en frente de él se encontraban dos jugadores clave, los españolesPere RullanyManuel Merillas. Este trío, el eventual podio de la competencia, se movería con proximidad entre sí –hablamos de segundos, basicamente– desde este punto hasta la meta. A los 20k, tras el descenso del Aratz y antes de comenzar la subida al Aizkorri, estaban tercero, quinto y séptimo respectivamente. Luego en la cumbre del Aizkorri, al km 23, se mantenían en las mismas posiciones, pero Tadei había abierto una diferencia de casi un minuto sobre los otros dos. A los 28k, estaban prácticamente juntos nuevamente, y a los 37k, lo estaban definitivamente. En los últimos 5k, Tadei le abrio 30 segundos a Manuel, el segundo colocado, y 90 segundos a Pere, el tercero coloado, para convertirse en el campeón masculino de la edición 2015. ¡Que batalla!

Cada vez que lo vimos, a los 16k, 20k, 23k y 28k, estaba en el centro del baile, alrededor de la mitad del top 10 masculino. Finalizó quinto. Pere Rullan celebrando el tercer puesto. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Jessed Hernándezde España fue sexto,Michel Lannede Francia fue séptimo,Zaid Ait Malek(Marroquí viviendo en España) (entrevista pre carrera) fue octavo, Ionut Zinca fue noveno pagando un poco su ataque del comienzo, y Hassan Ait Chaou de España fue décimo. Kilian Jornetde Catalunya, un inscripto de último momento, se mantuvo en el centro del baile –e incluso liderando a los 23k– hasta pasar la cumbre del Andraitz a los 28k. Luego de eso, enfrentó algunos problemas físicos y bajó el ritmo. Finalizó en 22do puesto, aunque probablemente arribó a Zegama dentro del top 10. Allí se detuvo a estrechar la mano y palmear a cada espectador que se acercó en su camino a meta. Sonrisas y un estómago complicado… el resumen de la Zegama 2015 de Kilian Jornet. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Resultados completos. ¡Wow, que carrera entre las chicas! La españolaOihana Kortazarfue definitivamente la que salio agresivamente a establecer el ritmo en la primer mitad. La vimos liderando un grupo de mujeres que empujaban duro a los 16 kilómetros, 20k y 23k. La doble campeona de Zegama tiene uno de los registros más rápidos en este circuito, y es fácil entender por qué cuando la ves competir, con una fuerza descomunal en ascenso y moviéndose ágilmente por los terrenos técnicos como si fuese un paseo dominical. Sin embargo, a pesar de estar en modo ataque por la primer mitad de competencia, tenía una gran pila de chicas detrás. Luego de 23k, en la cumbre del Aizkorri, lo que sigue es un filo y un descenso super técnico, y allí fue donde la campeonaAzara García(entrevista post carrera), una estrella Española en ascenso de las carreras por montaña Europeas, tomó el liderato. Cada vez que vimos a Azara previo a los 23k, se encontraba en los talones de Oihana. Luego de la carrera dijo que tuvo un momento difícil a mitad de carrera, pero luego del descenso tras 23k se sintió mejor y fue capaz de dar todo. Desde allí hasta la meta, trabajó una diferencia pequeña pero suficiente sobre el resto de las mujeres, convirtiendose así en la campeona femenina en su primera vez en Zegama. Azara García, Campeona del Maratón Zegama-Aizkorri 2015. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Paula Cabrerizode España fue Segunda, y al igual que Azara, se mantuvo a la sombra del resto de las mujeres en la primer mitad. A los 23k, en la cumbre del Aizkorri, Paula se había unido a Oihana y Azara. A los 28k, en la cumbre del Andraitz, Paula se había ubicado solidamente en segundo lugar, puesto en el que eventualmente acabaría. Paula Cabrerizo terminando segunda. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell.

Al principio de la prueba, corrio en el cierre del top 10 femenino, pero a escasos minutos de la líder. Sin embargo, poco a poco, fue escalando posiciones hasta el quinto lugar en el km 20, y el cuarto en el km 23. Desde allí, se mantuvo muy bien en el cuarto lugar, posición en la que termino.

2015 The North Face 100k-Australia Results,"AmericanDylan Bowmanand China’sDong Liprevailed as men’s and women’s champions at the 2015 edition ofThe North Face 100k-Australia. Read on to find out how the race unfolded for Dylan and Dong, as well as the other top runners. In addition to this article, visitour preview pagefor our collection of pre-race interviews, preview, and other race-day information.

The lead 10-ish men–a healthy mix of local and international talent–stayed as a tight pack, rolling through the first two checkpoints all within a minute of each other. Somewhere between Checkpoints 2 and 3, however, international runners France’sFrançois D’Haene(pre-race interview), the U.S.’sDylan Bowman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), China’sYan Long-Fei, and France’sJulien Choriertook a wrong turn and missed 1.5 kilometers of the course. Thus, at Checkpoint 3, 46 kilometers into the race, they were issued a 15-minute ‘stand-out’ penalty, where they were all required to stand and wait 15 minutes before continuing. This meant that the Aussie-New Zealand crowd ofScott Hawker(a Kiwi living in Australia)(post-race interview),Andrew Tuckey(Australia), andJono O’Laughlin(Australia) were the first three out of the 46k aid station. Dylan Bowman, 2015 The North Face 100k-Australia champion. Photo: iRunFar/Paul Charteris The next time our team saw the lead men, a bit after 53k, the penalized group had overtaken everyone but Scott, who was still two minutes out in front and pushing with a big smile on his face. At 66k, our next leaders’ sighting, François, Dylan, and Yan had caught and were running with Scott. But, after 75k, the lead group had fully splintered with Dylan and Yan off the front. The pair continued to lead together for the next almost 20k. At around 93k, on the long, tough climb back to town and the finish line, Dylan made a move and didn’t look back. He later explained that he redlined it to the finish, pushing himself to the point of cramps in the finish chute. At the finish, he called his day his best race ever. This marks Dylan’s second win of an Ultra-Trail World Tour race, after his win of theTarawera Ultramathon(post-race interview) earlier this year. While Dylan forged head, Yan dropped back, from second to fourth position, explaining later at the finish that he didn’t eat enough after 85k and slowed significantly. Scott Hawker happy after finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Paul Charteris Scott, on the other hand, ran in stalking position for the race’s final quarter, lingering a couple minutes behind the leader, and then passing Yan when he faltered. China’sYun Yan-Qiao, who ran around the fifth or sixth position for much of the race, came on strong in the race’s final quarter to capture the final spot on the podium and passing countrymate Yan in the process. A pre-race favorite and one of the guys who shared the lead for much of the race, François D’Haene, finished fifth, saying at the finish that the pace was just too fast for him today. Yun Yan-Qiao running toward third place. Photo: iRunFar/Paul Charteris Vajin Armstrong(New Zealand),Mark Green(a Kiwi living in Australia), Julien Chorier,PauBartoló(Spain), and Jono O’Loughlin finished fifth through 10th, respectively. Andrew Tuckey, an early leader who finished second last year, dropped from the race. Full results. After some very early-position shifting, the U.S.’sCassie Scallonsettled into the women’s lead by the 10-kilometer point. China’sDong Li(post-race interview)ran in a close second, even sharing the lead with Cassie at times, such as when they came into the 46k checkpoint together. However, at 60k, Cassie had built a five-minute lead over Dong again, and we began to think the scales were starting to lean in Cassie’s favor. Except that when we next saw the women at 72k, there was no Cassie to be seen. New women’s leader Dong carried her leadership position to the finish line. Dong is certainly making a strong showing of the 2015 Ultra-Trail World Tour with a second place at the Vibram Hong Kong 100k (post-race interview) and a third place at Transgrancanaria (post-race interview).

2015 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results," If mountain running was a school, thenLuis Alberto HernandoandEmelie Forsbergtaught the men’s and women’s fields some solid lessons today as they won the 2015Transvulcania Ultramarathonwithout challenge. Read on to hear more about how the race unfolded. In addition to this results summary, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and preview on our Transvulcanialive-coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Transvulcania-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Be sure to check back! Thank you toSalomonfor sponsoring our Transvulcania coverage! Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Spain’sLuis Alberto Hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) let others–including Zach Miller, Dimitris Theodorakakos, and Dakota Jones–do the leading, for at least the first 30k of the race, sitting on their heels and matching them step for step. He ran ahead of the lead pack now and again, seemingly testing the crowd to see who would or could chase. Between 30k and 50k, Luis turned on the afterburners and broke from his nearest competition by five minutes and the rest of the field by 20. Over the course of the race’s final 23k, he outpaced everyone else by more than a minute per kilometer, issuing a master class in finishing strong. His 6:52:39 is a new course record over the previous record held by Kilian Jornet by about 90 seconds. Luis Alberto Hernando, 2015 Transvulcania Ultramarathon champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell As evidenced byDani Garcia’s, of Spain, high bib number, 660, I don’t think anyone expected him to finish in second place. Though the race tracker tells us he was hovering just outside the men’s top 10 for the race’s first half, Dani made a huge move between 30k and 50k, from outside the top 10 to sharing third place with Dakota Jones. He then moved into and held that second position from the top of the long descent all the way to the finish. We’d love to know more of Dani’s story! Dani Garcia on his way to finishing second. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Australia’sBlake Hose(post-race interview) has shined at races down under, and perhaps looking at his previous results, he fit into the category of guys who seemed primed to breakout. That said, breakout races are rare and difficult to put together. No matter, this guy nailed it. In the race’s first half, Blake shadowed the guys who were sharing the lead, a couple to several minutes back. As late as 52k, Blake was in sixth place. Then, he executed a super-solid race finish, moving up position by position until he found his way onto the podium by the end of the 8,000-foot descent with only a few kilometers to go. What’s next when you breakout like Blake did today? The sky is the limit now. Blake Hose would go on to finish third. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Dakota Jones(pre-race interview) looked good early, suffered during the big climb after 30k, tolerated the second third of the race, and then got his shit together for a strong finish. The American was among the pace-setting crowd at the front of the race early on, but fell back from the leaders by 20 minutes between 30k and 50k, slowing by a minute per kilometer. During the last 10k of the race, things got real volatile between third and sixth place with positions constantly shifting. Dakota responded to that pressure, moving into fourth position on the final climb to the finish. He fought off a finish-chute sprint by fifth-place Zach Miller, but maintained position. Watching the U.S.’sZach Miller(pre-race interview) race was a little like watching a reality TV show. Intense, the plot continually changing, a guy just putting it out there despite everything else, and an end-of-story cliffhanger. Zach spent a lot of the first 30k of the race setting the pace, running off the front or at the front of the lead men’s group. Then, between 30k and 50k, he lost five minutes on leader Luis Alberto Hernando. After that, on the long descent between 50k and 65k-ish and the climb between 65k-ish and about 71k, he gave up a couple more positions and was as low as sixth place. He fought his way into fifth position, then pressed in the finish chute toward fourth, but Dakota Jones held him off. Greece’sDimitrios Theodorakakos, Spain’sCristofer Clemente, Spain’sPablo Villa, France’sJulien Coudert, and France’sAurélien Donandcompleted the men’s top 10. Men’s Results Full results. The women’s race was theEmelie Forsberg(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) show, start to finish. Even from the first checkpoint at Los Canarios, just six kilometers in, the Swede had set herself apart from the field by minutes. From there until 62k, Emelie grew her lead to 30 minutes. Then, from 62k to the 73k finish, her lead neither expanded nor contracted. Though she seemed to suffer a bit with the afternoon heat at the lower elevations of the last part of the course, she did not give up any of her lead. At the finish, Emelie seemed both relieved to have arrived and proud of polishing off her first ultramarathon of 2015 so strongly. Emelie Forsberg, 2015 Transvulcania Ultramarathon champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Spain’sAnna Comet(post-race interview) appears to be a relatively new arrival on the trail-ultra scene, but her race today seemed calculated all the way through, as if she’s been at this for a long time. Early on, Anna ran in the back half of the women’s top five, slowly creeping up as the race progressed. Her stats went like this: fourth at 22k, fourth at 30k, third at 50k, second at 62k, and second at the finish. And, also like an experienced ultrarunner, she seemed in control all day, no matter the terrain. The smart-racing award of Transvulcania goes to second-place Anna.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks France’sMyriam “Mimi” Guillot(post-race interview) is a crossover adventure racer who has sporadically raced ultra-trails over the last seven or eight years. Her adventure-racing team was world champions as recently as 2013, and her pepperings of ultra-trail finishes have always been podiums. Myriam took things out pretty hard and kept the guns firing all day long. Though she ran in second position for most of the day and gave that up to Anna Comet during the long descent between 50k and 62k, she was definitely pushing start to finish. Myriam Guillot running her way into third place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Alicia Shayspent the early part of the day in third position, and the latter part of the day in fourth. From the outside looking in, the American looked in her element on the climbs. As well as she looked climbing, our one glimpse of her descending at 62k, with some 6,500 feet of descent in just the previous 12k, she looked less strong on the descending. That said, she did not yield position and was fourth at the finish, holding her own all the way. Today’s consistency award goes to Poland’sMagdalena Łączakwho spent the early part of the race in a similar spot as the end of the race, right around the top five.

El EspañolLuis Alberto Hernando(entrevistaspre-carreraypost-carrera) dejo que los demás –Zach Miller, Dimitrios Theodorakakos, y Dakota Jones- lideren la prueba al menos por los primeros 30k de competencia, cómodo detrás de ellos y siguiéndolos paso a paso. Por momentos se adelantaba, quizás testeando al lote para ver quién podría perseguirlo. Entre el kilómetro 30 y 50, Luis encendió las turbinas y se escapó de sus perseguidores abriendo una diferencia de 5 minutos a los más cercanos, y 20 al resto de lote. En los 23 kilómetros finales del circuito, se alejó de los demás con una ventaja de casi un minuto por kilómetro, dando una clase maestra y finalizando muy fuerte. Sus 6:52:39 establecieron un nuevo récord de circuito, anteriormente de Kilian Jornet, superándolo por casi 90 segundos. Luis Alberto Hernando, campeón la Ultramaratón Transvulcania 2015. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Como lo evidencia el dorsal de número alto, 660,Dani Garcíade España no era uno de los candidatos a quedarse con el segundo lugar. ¿Puede alguien contarnos sobre este muchacho? Además de saber que se mantuvo fuera del top 10 por la primer mitad de carrera, Dani hizo su esfuerzo entre el kilómetro 30 y 50, de estar fuera del top 10 a compartir el tercer lugar con Dakota Jones. Luego avanzó y mantuvo esa segunda posición desde el principio del descenso largo hasta la meta. ¡Muero por saber más de Dani! Dani Garcia rumbo a finalizar segundo. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks El AustralianoBlake Hose(entrevista post-carrera) ha brillado en carreras de Oceanía, y quizás mirando a sus resultados previos, encaja en la categoría de chicos que están listos para dar el salto. Dicho eso, las carreras en las que se da el salto no son usuales y son difíciles de conseguir. Sin importar esto, este chico lo hizo. En la primer mitad de competencia, Blake se movió en la sombra de los chicos que compartían el liderato, algunos minutos detrás. Aún en el kilómetro 52, Blake se encontraba en sexta posición. Luego, se lanzó hacia un final de carrera súper sólido, escalando posiciones poco a poco hasta encontrarse dentro del podio tras finalizar el descenso de 2500 metros, con sólo unos kilómetros para la meta. ¿Qué queda por delante cuando logras dar el salto como hizo Blake hoy? Sólo el cielo es el límite ahora. Blake Hose seguiría su camino al tercer lugar. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Dakota Jones(entrevista pre-carrera) se vio bien al principio, sufrió durante el primer gran ascenso luego de 30k, tolero el segundo tercio de la carrera, y luego junto todas sus partes para finalizar de manera fuerte. El norteamericano se mantuvo con el lote de punta al principio de la carrera, pero cayó del mismo por casi 20 minutos entre el kilómetro 30 y el 50, perdiendo casi un minuto por kilómetro. Durante los últimos 10k de carrera, las cosas se tornaron muy volátiles entre el tercer y el sexto lugar, con las posiciones cambiando constantemente. Dakota respondió a esa presión, moviéndose al cuarto lugar en el último ascenso hacia la meta. También batalló un sprint final con quien terminaría quinto, Zach Miller, pero mantuvo su puesto. Ver la Carrera del EstadounidenseZach Miller(entrevista pre-carrera) fue como ver un Reality Show de televisión. Intenso, con la trama cambiando constantemente, con un tipo dejando todo a pesar de todo, y con un melodrama para finalizar la historia. Zach paso la mayoría de los primeros 30k de carrera estableciendo el ritmo, corriendo con el lote de punta. Luego, entre el kilómetro 30 y el 50, perdió cinco minutos con el líder Luis Alberto Hernando. Después de eso, en el descenso largo entre el kilómetro 50 y el 65, y en el ascenso entre el kilómetro 65 y el 71, perdió algunas posiciones y quedó relegado al sexto lugar. Dio batalla hasta llegar a la quinta posición, luego apretó hasta el sprint final por el cuarto lugar, pero Dakota Jones no se lo permitió. Dimitrios Theodorokakosde Grecia,Cristofer Clementede España,Pablo Villade España,Julien Coudertde Francia, yAurélien Donandde Francia completaron el top 10 masculino. Resultados Masculinos Resultados completos. La Carrera de las mujeres fue el show deEmelie Forsberg(entrevistaspre-carreraypost-carrera), de principio a fin. Incluso en el primer avituallamiento en Los Canarios, sólo seis kilómetros dentro de la carrera, la Sueca se había cortado del resto del lote por minutos. Desde allí al kilómetro 62, Emelie aumento su diferencia a 30 minutos. Luego, del kilómetro 62 a la meta en el 73, su liderato ni se aumentó, ni decreció. A pesar de que se la vio sufrir con el calor de la tarde en las partes finales del circuito, no regaló nada de su liderato. Ya en la meta, Emelie parecía estar relajada por haber finalizado y orgullosa de haber pulido de esta forma su primer ultramaratón del 2015 de manera tan sólida. Emelie Forsberg, campeona de la Ultramaratón Transvulcania 2015. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Anna Comet(entrevista post-carrera) de España pareciera ser una protagonista relativamente nueva en la escena de las ultra trail, pero su carrera hoy pareció estar calculada de principio a fin, como si hubiese estado en este asunto por mucho tiempo. Al principio, Anna corrió detrás del top cinco femenino, escalando posiciones lentamente con el progreso de la carrera. Sus estadísticas fueron las siguientes: cuarta a los 22k, cuarta a los 30k, tercera a los 50k, segunda a los 62k y segunda en meta. Y, al igual que una corredora con vasta experiencia en ultramaratones, se la vio controlada todo el día, sin importar el terreno. El premio a la performance más inteligente de Transvulcania va al segundo lugar de Anna. Anna Comet, segundo escalón del podio, en el descenso de 2500 metros.

Su equipo de Carreras de Aventura fue campeón del mundo de la especialidad en el 2013, y sus resultados en ultra-trail siempre fueron arriba del podio. Myriam se tomó las cosas duramente y apretó todo el día. A pesar de haber corrido todo el día en segunda posición, y haber cedido la posición a Anna Comet durante el último descenso entre el kilómetro 50 y el 62, definitivamente apretó desde el principio al final. Myriam Guillot corriendo hacia el tercer puesto. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Alicia Shaypaso la mayor parte del día en tercera posición, y la última parte del día en cuarta. Viéndolo desde afuera, la norteamericana se sintió cómoda en los ascensos. Así como se la vio bien trepando, la única vez que la vimos descender fue en el kilómetro 62, ya con 2000 metros de desnivel negativo en los 12 kilómetros previos, y no la vimos tan fuerte en bajada. Dicho esto, no cedió la posición y fue cuarta en meta, sosteniendo el paso durante todo el camino. El premio a la constancia va para la PolacaMagdalena Łączak, quién desde temprano en la carrera hacia el final, paso los kilómetros en la misma posición en la que terminaría, rondando el top cinco.

2015 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results,"It was a glorious day for racing at the eighth annualLake Sonoma 50 Mile. It was cool all morning with light clouds moderating the sun. At worst, it got warm at midday, but conditions remained fast with dry, but not dusty trails, too. How fast? Well, for the eighth-straight year, but the women and men’s course records went down, this time toStephanie Howe(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andAlex Varner(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Read on to find out how the the men’s and women’s races played out. In addition, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on ourLake Sonoma 50 live coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Lake Sonoma 50-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Thanks again toJulbofor making our coverage of this year’s Lake Sonoma possible. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Jim Walmsleytook the race out with a vengeance, opening up an early lead on the entire field. For the first 20 miles,Alex Varner,Ryan Bak(post-race interview), andMike Aishgrouped up and ran together between 30 and 90 seconds behind Walmsley, gaining on the climbs and falling back on the descents. By halfway, Bak led his crew of three past Walmsley. Alex Varner cruising at mile 30. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Rob Krar(pre-race interview),Jared Hazen(post-race interview), andSeth Swansonhad been rolling together for the first 20+ miles, as well, no more than 90 seconds behind Varner-Bak-Overdrive. Well, Rob saw some fireroads he liked shortly before the turn around and broke apart his little group. Walmsley’d put his parachute out, so Krar shot up in the ranks to fourth at mile 30… but not a comfortable looking fourth. He trailed Varner by nearly 5.5 minutes at that point, while Varner had a minute on Bak and two on Aish. Meanwhile,Jorge Maravillahad moved himself up from ninth at mile 20 to fifth at mile 30 alongside the 19-year-old Hazen. Seth Swanson sat in seventh, about where he’d been all day, except he, too, had passed Walmsley. Jared Hazen finishing. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell As the boys raced back around the lake, Varner continued building a lead with Bak following along in second. At the same time, the wheels fell off for Aish and Krar. Some would pass them as the two walked, while others did after the pair dropped at mile 38. That moved most of the competitive crew up some spaces. Now in third, Hazen kept pushing, as he was on the podium and, more important for him, in a Montrail Ultra Cup golden ticket spot for Western States entry. Varner, Bak, and Hazen would continue on to finish 1-2-3, with Varner breaking Zach Miller’s course record of 6:11:10 set last year. Ryan Bak being congratulated by teammate Alex Varner. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Jorge Maraville couldn’t stick on Hazen’s bumper past mile 33 after the pair spent some time battling, but he finished in fourth in a time time a few minutes faster than last year’s race. Jim Walmsley went big early and it didn’t work out for a podium spot; however, he greatly impressed by regrouping after mile 30 and holding his position. Seth Swanson couldn’t match the speed of the guys up front, but ran a steady race to finish more or less in the place he held all day, minus the two drops in front of him. Jorge Maravilla doing his thing. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Tim Tollefsonbounced around between eighth and tenth through the race and he held on to that position, when accounting for Aish and Krar. On the other hand, Mike Wardian seemed far out of the hunt early and was no better than 15th at mile 20, 17 minutes off the lead. He was, however, basing his race off heart rate and cruised up the field as the race progressed.Max King(pre-race interview)… well,he did say before the racethat he had tired legs from the LA Marathon. It turned into a long training run for him early. He was already lackadaisical in walking across the stream crossing at mile 12. Kudos toGary Gellinfor going out hard and holding on to break seven hours after being just over the mark the past two years. That 6:59-and-change was good enough to give him tenth. Max King calmly crosses a stream at mile 12. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Gary Gellin is one excited guy. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell On the women’s side, it wasStephanie Howe’sday. The previous two years, she’d finished third and second at Lake Sonoma and she was bound and determined to win this year. She was joined early in the race byYiOu WangandKerrie WladwithSarah Bardin hot pursuit. By mile 20, Sarah had fallen nine minutes off the lead into sixth with YiOu and Kerrie 20 and 60 seconds back, respectively. 2013 champCassie Scallon(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)was 90 seconds back at 12 miles and 4 minutes back at mile 20. Behind her, there was a gap back to the rest of the field. At mile 12,Ashley Erba(post-race interview),Keely Henninger,Kaci Lickteig,Lindsay Tollefson, andPam Smithcame through in sixth through tenth, all between six and seven minutes off the lead. The leading ladies at mile 12. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell By the time the ladies were back Liberty Glen–mile 30, Stephanie had built an eight minute lead on Cassie who now ran in second. Kerrie Wlad was just a bit behind Cassie in third. Neither woman looking nearly as comfortable as Steph, who’s smiled and laughed as she ran past on a descent uphill. Ashley was in fourth not far back, with YiOu close behind. There was now an even bigger gap back to Lindsay, Sarah (who’d quickly fallen back to seventh), and another gap back to Kaci,Meghan Arbogast, andDenise Bourassa. Stephanie Howe leading 30 miles into the race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell While Stephanie kept driving home for the course record and Cassie ran strong toward a second-place finish, carnage descended on the women’s race. YiOu badly sprained a previously surgically-repaired ankle and dropped. Sarah Bard tired to the point of wanting a boat ride out of the mile 45 aid station before continuing on to the finish. Keely Henninger fell and dislocated her shoulder. Even three of the top ten women were plenty bloody after the race with another having run head-first into a tree. Cassie Scallon crossing a stream at mile 12. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Ashley survived the mayhem to take third in her first 50-mile race. At 19 years old, she will decline the Western States spot. However, word is that fourth-place woman Kerrie was eager to take that ticket. (Stephanie Howe is already in States.) Kaci Lickteig might never have seemed on today, but she moved up from eighth at mile 30 to fifth at the finish. Lindsay finished sixth in her first 50 miler while Meghan took seventh in what was not her first 50 miler. Both Meghan and eighth-place woman Denise Bourassa ran patient, conservative races that paid off in the end.Alicia HudelsonandLydia Blandydefinitely weren’t in the top ten the first half of the race, but they made ninth and tenth by the finish. Lydia had finished eleventh at Sonoma last year. Kaci Lickteig rolling through mile 30. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Lindsay Tollefsan takes sixth in her first 50 miler.

2015 Marathon des Sables (MdS) Results,"The 30thMarathon des Sables(MdS) began the morning of Sunday, April 5 in the Moroccan Sahara with more than 1,300 participants toeing the line at this special anniversary event. For those unfamiliar, the MdS is a seven-day, six-stage race (only the first five stages count toward the rankings this year) in which competitors carry all their own supplies except for a daily water ration and a shade tent to sleep under… which they share with seven other competitors. As in past years, we will share results and commentary–including updates from the field–after each stage. We’ll often update stage results multiple times per day, as additional information, updates, and resources are available. Click on the links below to jump to our coverage of a particular stage.

That didn’t work as Sedykh eventually fell to five minutes behind Watson at 38km before kicking to finish just seconds behind the Brit. Elisabet Barnes wins all five competitive stages of the 2015 Marathon des Sables. Photo: Cimbaly (c) MDS15 Rebecca Ferry(+26:23) had a seventh- and a tenth-place finish in earlier stages this year, but she trumped that by taking fourth today. She held that position all stage ahead ofLiza Howard(+28:29), who ran in fifth all stage after a rough go at the previous stage. Liza Howard (right) racing Stage 5. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Melissa Venables(+31:40) worked her way up from 11th place early in the stage to place sixth after passingJolanda Linschooten(+35:50), who held six most of the day, late in the stage. Gemma Game(+38:09) ran another steady stage, sitting in eighth all day. The performance was enough to move her up a spot in the cumulative rankings. Switzerland’sClaire McCahill(+45:47) ran her first top-ten performance of the race in taking ninth today. Ireland’sClaire Morrissey(+46:36) has been all over the women’s rankings during this year’s MdS, finishing stages anywhere from fourth to 11th. Today, she finished 10th. Former champsMeghan Hicks(+59:50) andLaurence Klein(+1:49:17) simply finished off their races today. Women’s Stage 5 Results Women’s Overall Results Through Stage 5 With large time gaps through much of the women’s field after Stage 4, there weren’t many changes to the overall ranking at the front of the field after Stage 5.

Akhdar’s seven-plus minute gap on fifth placeSalameh Al Aqra(+9:42) was enough catapult him ahead of Al Aqra into fourth in the overall standings.

Larbi Zeroual(+19:47) of France andTimon Abegglen(+20:06) of Switzerland must have saved something for the final competitive stage, as they both made their first top-ten appearances of this race.

Rachid El Mortabity beats out Abdelkader El Mouaziz to win the 2015 MdS. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Field Report – From Meghan Hicks Stage 5 – My Personal Race I came to the 2015 MdS with between 95 and 97% of the training I had before my win here in 2013. My pack was sorted. I did ample heat training both in a sauna and in Morocco before the race. Unfortunately, something didn’t cure right, and it didn’t all come together. I knew it from kilometer 1 on day 1, that this was going to be challenging year. I fought dueling emotions of the loss of my goal and pure elation at being here and being a part of the journey that is this race until the morning of Stage 3. That morning I woke up with sense of peace: no matter how much you try to control and impact your experience, you can’t keep hold of it all. I still don’t know why my race paces and feelings didn’t match my training, maybe I never will. But I saw a week’s worth of Saharan sunrises and sunsets, saw all seven of my tentmates reach the finish, and I reached my own personal Mds goal: five finishes. And for this moment, this last night in the desert, that is all I need. Field Report – From Kirstern Kortebein Today’s 42.2-kilometer route was a scenic one, including dunes, camel herds, oueds, and plateaus. The temperatures were not as high as they have been for most of the week, but many competitors were struggling with stomach issues starting today’s final stage. The race organization opted once again for a staggered start–first group departing at 7:00 am BMT, second group departing at 8:30 am–and decided to reorganize the finish line setup to avoid the queue chaos of last year’s finish line. Medals were handed out not only by Patrick, but by other MdS personnel as well. This really did help avoid the backup that had happened at the finish line last year, and runners were able to receive their medals and water rations fairly immediately after finishing. Women’s Race SwedeElisabet Barnesfinished first in today’s marathon stage, wrapping up her sweep of first-place finishes in all five stages of this year’s MdS. She says that she didn’t feel well waking up this morning, though; she was struggling with a sore throat and stomach issues before the race start. “I was forced to start out sensibly,” she said. “Natalia [Sedykh]shot off as expected, but I passed her after about 4 kilometers.” Elisabet says that she really enjoyed the course, but that the end–the final hills, and seeing dunes in the distance–was rough for her. Natalia’s initial kick wasn’t enough to bring her into second place overall, though. She ultimately finished today’s stage in third place, and was very emotional as she finished just behind Britain’sAnna-Marie Watson. Natalia and Anna-Marie now sit in second and third places, respectively. USA’sElizabeth Howardwas feeling much better during today’s marathon stage, and set off strong in the early start (7:00 am BMT.) She was the fifth woman to cross the finish line today, coming in two minutes after Britain’sRebecca Ferry. USA’sMeghan Hicksand France’sLaurence Kleinfinished today’s race in 14th and 29th places respectively, and Meghan finished in fifth place overall. Laurence was tired but calm as she crossed the finish line, and seemed content in having accepted the fact that she would not be finishing top five in this year’s MdS. Men’s Race Morocco’sRachid El Morabity,Abdelkader El Mouaziz, andAziz El Akadtook first, second, and third in today’s stage, finishing respectively in said places overall. The front of the pack stuck together for the majority of the race, with Rachid and El Mouaziz running together until the last 200 meters. “We are running for the same team,” said Rachid regarding himself and El Mouaziz. “Since we’re running together, it didn’t matter which one of us won [today’s stage.]” Aziz El Akad is very happy with his success in this year’s Marathon des Sables, and is particularly proud of his performance during the long stage. “[The long stage] was the only solution for me to place on the podium,” he said. Morocco’sSamir Akhdarfinished today’s stage in fourth place, securing an overall ranking of fourth place. Samir credits his success in this year’s MdS to having focused on running his own race and following his own rhythm instead of getting caught up in trying to stick with the front-runners in the way he has in the past. “You are the chief of your own body,” he said with a smile. Jordan’sSalameh El Aqrais still struggling with a torn muscle in his lower left leg, but still managed to finish fifth in today’s marathon stage. This puts him in fifth place overall. “I finished 91 kilometers with this leg injury [during the long stage]” he said. “What’s 42 more?” Additional Information  Stage 4: Jebel Zireg to Jdaid (91.7 km) Men – Stage 4 Defending champRachid El Morabityran up front all from “go.” (Well, up front all except for the 1,200 runners who started three hours before him.)Salameh Al Aqra(+1:02:53) andAbdelkader El Mouaziz(+7:53) went with Rachid through checkpoint 2 (26km)… that’s when the tractor-pull sled started creeping up Al Aqra’s back… dropping him to eighth by the end of the day. On the other hand, El Mouaziz hung with El Morabity past the final checkpoint at 85.7km. Yeah… and then El Morabity put 8 minutes on El Mouaziz in 6 kilometers. Boom! Segment. Stage. Race. El Morabity. Rachid El Morabity wins the long stage. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Aziz El Akaddid prove himself to be the master today. He was in 12th 12km, ninth at 26km, and seventh at 38km… he was in third for good before the final checkpoint at 86km. Chapeau, El Akad. Having metSamir Akhdar(+43:50) as a “kid” back in 2009 and having known his gracious smile since then, personally, it’s great to see Samir take fourth in today’s long stage. In the past, he’s been overshadowed by his Moroccan friends and teammates. Well, the sun rose on Samir Akhdar today!Chema Martínezwas the top European today, only four minutes behind Akhdar. Chema went out in fourth past 26km before dropping all the way back to ninth. He then proceeded to climb all the way back to fifth for the day. Both El Mouaziz and Martínez went into the race with other favorites doubting each’s ability to perform in the long stage… well, both ran strong with El Mouaziz nailing it. (There’s no shame in losing to the defending champ.) Chema Martínez celebrates his fifth-place finish in the long stage. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein In an otherwise typically dynamic stage, it looks like France’sChristophe Le Saux(+51:39) ran in sixth all day. That’s a nice improvement from his already solid eighth-place finish in last year’s long stage. Le Saux’s teammate and countrymanAntoine Guillon(+1:01:12) finished ten minutes further back in seventh. A steady Eddie, he gradually worked himself up from tenth position at 12km. Behind Al Aqra in ninth was the SwissMarco De Martin(+1:11:43), who (figuratively) appears to have been towed by Guillon by a bungee cord. He slowly lost time to the Frenchman through the stage, but that was still a fast enough pace to move from 13th to ninth by stage’s end.Danny Kendall’s(+1:29:17) meticulously moved his way up the MdS overall rankings through the years with great patience and sound strategy. Well, it appears as though he gambled in going for it today… without coming up aces. He was in fifth only 6.5 minutes off the lead at 38km. He finished in 10th, 90 minutes off the lead. Men’s Stage 4 Results … Overall Results through Stage 4 While it’s not over until the Frenchman gives kisses, it looks like we can chalk up the 2015 Marathon des Sables to Morocco’sRachid El Morabity. He’s won his fourth-straight stage and, now, only has to mark countrymanAbdelkader El Mouaziz’smoves to guarantee his overal win. Likewise, El Mouaziz has second-place overall wrapped up with more than half an hour in-hand overAziz El Akad. Abdelkader El Mouaziz at the finish of Stage 4.

Salameh Al Aqra after a painful long stage. Photo: Kirstern Kortebein … Women – Stage 4 Well, what a stage THAT was!Elisabet Barneswon the stage by nearly an hour. She actually ran in third past 26km after which she passedLiza Howardand caughtLaurence Klein, after Liza and Laurence pushed the pace early with Liza holding a solo lead at 12km. Well, by the later portions of the stage, Elisabet powered on with Liza and Laurence deployed parachutes and quickly slowed to a crawl. Laurence finished 22nd in the stage, more than five hours behind Elisabet.GPSsuggests that Liza is still out on the course between checkpoints. Anna-Marie Watson(+49:55) wins a gold star today. She was one of five women to start 3 hours after the main field along with the top 50 men. She was the fourth woman from her group through 26km, already 15 minutes slower than then leader Liza Howard. She appears to have run her own steady race, passing Laurence and Liza when they faulted. She couldn’t have known at the time, but she was trading fourth- and fifth-place splits and later second- and third-place withNatalia Sedykh(+51:25), who started three hours early after a 1-hour penalty the previous day knocked her out of the top five where she previously sat. Anna-Marie Watson after taking second in the long stage. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein [Author’s Note:I’ll take this moment to perhaps suggest that the Marathon des Sables revise its Top 50 men and Top 5 women long-stage start. A podium position or even a top-five spot is a significant honor at the Marathon des Sables and with Stage 4 often being a dramatic shakeup of the race, either the Top-10 overall women or all women within three hours of the lead through Stage 3 start with the later group. As it stands, two women werede factoracing for second in the stage and in the overall rankings, while being separated by three hours. They could not know their relative positions. The Top 5 cutoff may have made since in times when there was not as much depth in the women’s field, but even after two podium position women blew up in today’s stage, 11 women finished within 3 hours of the women’s winner… and, more importantly, within 25 minutes of the final non-blown up woman–Gemma Game–from the late start. All of those women were also within 25 minutes of Gemma at 35km, at which point I’d guess these women would have started catching the back of the pack from the early starters… had they been in the late start. My point with this paragraph is that having five to 10 additional women start in the “late start” would not significantly burden the races infrastructure by forcing checkpoints to be open significantly longer.] Back to today’s stage…Claire Morrissey(+1:31:24),Meghan Hicks(+1:40:24), andJolanda Linschooten(+2:10:42) all bounced around within a few minutes of another through the first 40km or so before they shook out into their finishing order of 4-5-6 on the day. Jolanda faded a good bit more than the other two at the end of the stage. Meghan Hicks smiles her way to a strong Stage 4. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Melissa Venables(+2:12:36) wassuperconservative through the stage. She was nearly seven minutes out of the women’s top ten… at 12km! She moved up all stage, even sneaking past Jolanda briefly to move into sixth, before finishing in seventh. PoorGemma Game(+2:33:46) was in the unenviable position of running as the fifth of five women in the late start. She was 4 minutes behind everyone 12 kilometers into her stage. Still, if you look at her splits versus all the women together, she went out “hard” and faded quiet strongly. I’d imagine she’s have felt some pressure or desire not to be running along off the back and that may have forced her hand. Sussanah Chan(+2:58:31) andEmily Foy(+2:58:31) went out harder than their previous stage finishes would have placed them, whileHolly Symons(+2:58:31) went out conservatively. By 38km, Chan and Foy had paired up and apparently worked together the rest of the stage. Symons caught the pair by 75km and the trio finished together in a tie for ninth on the day. [Initial women’s report] Former Top FiverNatalia Sedykhwas the first woman to cross the line today, but she started in the main field after receiving a one-hour penalty yesterday. The Top Five women and Top 50 men start three hours after the main field at the MdS’s long stage, so it will be a while before we know where Natalia’s 12:20:29 puts her amongst those five later women’s starts today. The most recent reliable update we have on the women’s top five is that overall leaderElisabet Barnesand three-time MdS champLaurence Kleinwere running together at 37.8km. At that point,Liza Howardfor just over 3 minutes back. [Update a few hours later, 4:30 p.m. PST] Elisabet Barnes won the long stage of this year’s Marathon des Sables. Interestingly, there aren’t any updates on either Laurence Klein or Liza Howard after the three checkpoints after 38km that are otherwise reporting online. At the same time, updates from the other two women from the top five who started in the later wave–Anna-Marie Watson and Gemma Game–do have updates from later checkpoints. I don’t want to be alarmist… as I have no hard info AND communication problems are inherent in such remote locations (trust me, I know!), but it’s possible that either of these two women are having issues. Two years ago, Laurence Klein was leading the MdS women’s race when she abandoned Stage 4. [Update a few minutes later] The race is now reporting that Anna-Marie Watson, also from the late (Top Five) start, has finished… with no report on Laurence or Liza. It could be that they’re just missing from the results… or there could be an entirely new race for the women’s podium at this year’s Marathon des Sables. Women’s Stage 4 Results Full Stage 4 results. Women’s Overall Results through Stage 4 Elisabet Barnesis the presumptive women’s champion of this year’s Marathon des Sables. She’s won each of the first four stages and can now slowly jog her way to overall victory. In a topsy-turvy race, big blowups byLaurence KleinandLiza Howardduring the long stage, a 1-hour penalty toNatalia Sedykhprior to Stage 4, AND, most importantly, a strong Stage 4 mean thatAnna-Marie Watsonjumped from sixth to second overall today. Natalia’s third-place finish on the day moved her up into third. (She had been in fourth prior to her penalty.) These two women should battle for second in Friday’s final marathon-length competitive stage. It’s worth noting that Natalia has run nearly hour faster than Anna-Marie has on the course. If both recover well tomorrow, this could be a great battle to the finish. Natalia Sedykh sits as third overall woman after the long stage. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Behind Natalie, there’s an almost (certainly insurmountable) hour toMeghan Hicks, who jumps up into fourth overall with her steady running on the long stage, butGemma Gameis a mere five minutes behind Hicks in fifth. Claire Morriseylook as if she should take sixth overall, whileMelissa VenablesandJolanda Linschootenshould battle one-another for seventh-place overall. Overall rankings through Stage 4.Field Report — From Meghan Hicks Stage 4 – In the Presence of Wind Have you ever run into a headwind for 45 miles? And not just a headwind, but a stiff one, blowing at 30 miles per hour or more. That’s what MdS competitors faced in yesterday and today’s 58-mile long stage. The 2015 MdS will surely go down as the year of the wind. Such a hard wind that competitors worked together, drafting, all day, all night. Such a hard wind that we had to lean into it. Such a hard wind that our entire bodies were coated in a thick layer of dust and sand. An upside to a persistent headwind is its cooling effect. You still need just as much water to counter the Sahara, but you feel less hot as you run. Wind, oh, how you roll. Field Report — From Kirsten Kortebein The long stage of this year’s Marathon des Sables–91.7 km–succeeded in shaking up both the men’s and women’s rankings. Clouds/dust covered the sun for the general classement start at 8:00 am BMT, but by the time the elite runners’ race began at 11:00 am, the heat was back in full force. The weather has been consistently windy throughout this MDS, and sandstorms have been intermittent. There was a strong headwind throughout the majority of yesterday’s race. [SeeKirsten’s Stage 4 photos.] Women’s Race SwedeElisabet Barnestook first place yet again during yesterday’s long stage; she mentioned yesterday that she thinks it takes “a couple times around to figure out this race,” proving once again that she’s got a real handle on the MDS this time around. Her only concern at the moment is that her shoes–she’s running in Hokas, the Clifton model–are collapsing a bit, and hopes they hold up. USA’sLiza Howardhad a tough time yesterday, dropping out of her second-place overall ranking. She started to have stomach issues circa CP5, was running on an empty stomach, and decided to lay down for 3-4 hours. After leaving CP5, she felt well until CP6, where she was unable to even keep down water. She did finish the stage a little after 7:00 am BMT, and will finish tomorrow’s stage, as well. She says that her pack is a likely cause of the vomiting…not necessarily because it was too heavy, but that its size proportional to her own body weight may have exacerbated her stomach issues. Laurence Kleinwould’ve been a likely candidate for third place during yesterday’s long stage, but she, too, fell far behind Elisabet Barnes. The MdS staff have reported that Laurence stopped along the way to help a runner who was having a medical issue, and waited for 45 minutes with him or her for the medical staff to arrive. She will not be receiving a “time credit” for the time spent helping the runners; regardless, this still doesn’t explain why she arrived around 4:00 am. The MDS staff and myself have been unsuccessful thus far in reaching Laurence for any further information. Those whodidcome in second and third places were Britain’sAnna-Marie Watsonand Russia’sNatalia Sedykh. Natalia was looking very well throughout the race, and finished looking equally strong. She started the race under a 1:00 hour penalty, though. This penalty was levied because one of the items required for runners to carry was missing from her pack during a control. USA’sMeghan Hickshas moved into fourth place in the overall ranking after yesterday’s long stage. She reported having felt well until about 9.5 hours in, and then had stomach issues. Men’s Race Rachid El Morabitywas the first of the top men to cross the finish line last night after yesterday’s 91.7-kilometer stage. He came in looking strong, proud, and left us all wondering how far behind he’d left Morocco’sAbdelkader El Mouaziz. As far as anyone at the finish line knew, Rachid and El Mouaziz had been running together all day; the last I’d seen them, they were blazing through CP5 together, barely stopping to get their water ration cards punched. In chatting with Rachid this morning, he reported that they’d run together up until “two kilometers from the finish,” where he then pulled ahead. El Mouaziz stayed focused yesterday, saying that he did feel tired during the long stage, largely due to the terrain (mountains, soft sand.) He credits his success in yesterday’s stage to having trained specifically for this stage, saying that “without strategy, [yesterday’s stage] would not have been possible.” Morocco’sAziz El Akadhad a fantastic day yesterday, coming in third place during the stage. All the Moroccan 4×4 drivers and tent personnel gathered at the finish line went nuts when they realized who was arriving, thrilled that three Moroccans had just swept first, second, and third place. He’s now sitting in third-place overall, and says that he’s only continued to feel stronger throughout each stage of this MdS. He made sure to stay vigilant during yesterday’s stage: not necessarily in terms of watching behind for other runners, but by calculating his food and water intake and listening to his body. This might be a good place to talk about Jordan’sSalameh Al Aqra, who finished yesterday’s stage in eighth place, just over an hour after Rachid. It left everyone at the finish line a bit confused when he didn’t come in within 15 minutes of Rachid, and there was some serious confusion when 9:30 pm (MDS time) rolled around and there was still no sign of him. As it turns out, he tore a muscle in his left leg on the jebel decent directly after CP1. He says he was in pain, but that he “had to finish, I didn’t care,” and continued on for the remainder of the 91.7 kilometers. “I’m used to this…I’m ten years in, you’ll always face something,” he says. He seems to have emotionally accepted the injury; if anything, he says he is disappointed that he pushed himself so hard yesterday, knowing that it was too much. His legacy of success in the MdS long stage still played a big role in yesterday’s race–both Rachid and El Mouaziz said that the most exhausting part of their race yesterday was constantly asking themselves when Salameh would arrive. “Ninety-one kilometers is a long way to always be watching for someone to catch you,” says Rachid, and noted that this constant vigilance was very stressful throughout the race. Samir Akhdar’ssmiling face was a great one to see as he crossed the finish line last night in fourth place. He’s worked so hard in his MdS preparations this year, and has really made an effort to run his own race throughout the stages thus far. “I raced yesterday for me, for myself,” he said. “You get stressed if you don’t race alone in your mind.” A bit further back,Dave Mackeyof the US felt well beginning yesterday’s race, but says that he succumbed to a number of factors during the long stage. Running in the midday heat was difficult for him, as the elite runners are typically finished and in camp by noon or 1:00 pm each day. He also had stomach issues throughout the first 60 kilometers of the race, and mentioned that he thinks he may have consumed too much fiber. Up until the last 25% of the race, he’d run on an empty stomach. He was finally able to rebound with some peanut butter, and finished the last 20 kilometers feeling better and on-pace. Additional Information  Stage 3: Jebel El Otfal to Jebel Zireg (36.7 km) On paper, Stage 3’s 23 miles look fairly benign. However, the terrain or the temps rarely leave an “easy” day as an option during the MdS. At the front of the pack, the speed of today’s stage seems on par with, if a hair faster than the preceding days. We look forward to reports from the field on how the Moroccan Sahara challenged the 1,300 runners today. The start of Stage 3. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Women – Stage 3 At the front of the women’s race, SwedeElisabet Barnescontinued her sweep of stage victories today. For the first time in this year’s race, FrenchwomanLaurence Klein(+7:18) bested the US’sLisa Howard(+13:42) to take second on the day. Elisabet Barnes on her way to winning her third-straight stage. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Natalia Sedykh(+19:33) andGemma Game(+29:50) have quite the set routine at this point. Natalia goes out hard (she was in second, just ahead of Howard at 14km today) and Gemma runs consistently (she’s been fifth woman at every checkpoint in this year’s MdS except for checkpoint 1 in Stage 1… she was sixth). For the third straight day, the Russian and Brit finished fourth and fifth, respectively, for the stage. However, Natalie bested Gemma by 10 minutes today as opposed to a minute or so in the two previous stages. The UK’sAnna-Marie Watson(+36:10) ran sixth woman all day, just as she did yesterday, but remains distinctly behind Natalia and Gemma. [Update April 8, 1 p.m. PDT: It appears that Natalia Sedykh recieved a 1-hour penalty yesterday. I’m awaiting additional details. – Bryon] More steady racing from the UK’s Gemma Game in Stage 3. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Rebecca Ferry(+48:24) of the UK continues to move up the women’s field. She was seventh today after finishing 12th in Stage 1 and eighth in Stage 2.Jolanda Linschooten(+49:24) bounced back from a rough day yesterday to finish eighth woman on the day just a minute behind Ferry. The UK’sMelissa Venables(+50:40) bounced around the women’s field today, as she was 14th at 14km before moving into eighth by 26km. She finished ninth on the day. Not far behind her was AmericanMeghan Hicks, who steadily stayed in tenth all day. Hicks reported before the race that the leg injury that kept her from running MdS last yearmightprevent her from “racing” this year’s event, but not from finishing as she could run pain-free at an easy pace. Her consistent placement within the women’s field during each stage suggests this may, in fact, be the case. Ireland’sClaire Morrissey(+1:09:19) is slowly sagging in the ranks, having gone from ninth to tenth to 11th through each of the first three stages. We’ve not noted her previously, but the UK’sEmily Foy(+1:13:35) finished 11th in the first two stages before taking 13th today, when she was four minutes behind Morrissey. Women’s Stage 3 Results Full Stage 3 results. Women’s Overall Results Through Stage 3 Men – Stage 3 Three stages and three 1-2-3 finishes forRachid El Morabity,Abdelkader El Mouaziz(+2:31), andSalameh Al Aqra(+4:18). However, Rachid’s not pulling away early in the stages. Today, the other two ran with or ahead of Rachid through the first checkpoint (14km), while El Mouaziz and Al Aqra were right with El Morabity at Checkpoint 2 (26km). However, Rachid seems able to pull away at will at the end of each stage. Tomorrow should sort things out amongst the top three… but Rachid seems pretty untouchable at this point. Many of the men’s contenders racing early in Stage 3. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Oh, the ever patientAziz El Akad(+4:57). He seems to be filling in Mohamad Ahansal’s elder statesman roll up front at this year’s MdS. He’s out there running by himself and getting it done that way. At 14km today, he was in fifth already two minutes off the lead. He then passedChema Martínez(+8:53) and made up ground on Al Aqra before Checkpoint 2 before settling in and taking fourth for the second-straight day. Martínez, on the other hand, was once again aggressive, running with the leaders through the first checkpoint before being dropped quite hard. This is not promising for tomorrow’s upcoming long stage. Akad El Aziz giving chase early in Stage 3. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein The UK’sDanny Kendall(+13:20) knows his place. It was seventh the first day and sixth the past two days. He went out in seventh today before passingSamir Akhdar(+14:21) late in today’s stage. Behind Akhdar, there was a small gap to another five guys within eight minutes of one another. It appears thatDave Mackey(+20:03) andChristophe Le Saux(+20:36) were close to one another all day before Mackey put half a minute on Le Saux late in the stage to take eighth. Switzerland’s Marco De Martin (+24:40) ran in tenth all day today after finishing eighth in Stage 1 and 11th in Stage 2.Mohamad Ahansal’s(+26:17) leg has him far outside the top five, but he continues on, taking 11th today ahead ofAntoine Guillon(+27:55). Those two andCarlos Sá(+33:31) all bounced around between 11th and 13th through the course of Stage 3. Sá ended up in 13th. Men’s Stage 3 Results Men’s Overall Results Through Stage 3 iRunFar Field Report – From Kirsten Kortebein Nearly every day in the Sahara is hot, but today, it ishot. Due to the severe flooding in this area of the desert throughout the last couple of months, the ground and the air hold much more moisture this year than they typically do during the MdS. This has been noticeable throughout the race, but the air was especially heavy during today’s Stage Three. It hasn’t been markedly sunny today–in fact, it’s been fairly overcast and hazy–but everyone is feeling the effects of today’s atypical humidity. Men’s Race Morocco’s Rachid El Morabity took first place again during today’s stage, followed once more by Morocco’s Abdelkader El Mouaziz. Rachid says he is feeling very “in form” and is not tired heading into tomorrow’s long stage, but he did mention that today’s heat was severe for him. He is content with his performance thus far, and hopes to continue his current rhythm during Stage Four. It will be interesting to see how tomorrow’s Stage Four shakes out for El Mouaziz; he is aware that he will need to be careful not to overdo it at the beginning of the stage, and plans to find his pace behind–not with–Rachid throughout tomorrow’s 91.7 kilometers. Finishing today’s stage just one minute after El Mouaziz was Jordan’s Salameh Al Aqra, who is in good spirits and is looking forward to tomorrow’s long stage. “[The long stage] is my day,” he says, and notes that he has a chance of moving up in his ranking if he can play it smart tomorrow. Morocco’s Aziz El Akad finished today in fourth place, and is preparing for tomorrow’s long stage. “It will not be easy to run tomorrow,” he says, but plans to eat well tonight in preparation. Chema Martínez looked well coming through kilometer 8 with the front pack, but fell back as the race went on, and finished in fifth place. Danny Kendall and Samir Akhdar came in sixth and seventh today. Samir acknowledges that he should’ve found his own rhythm today instead of trying to stick with the top four men, and plans to run his own race during tomorrow’s long stage, for which he feels very prepared. Women’s Race Sweden’s Elisabet Barnes took first place yet again during Stage Three, followed today by France’s Laurence Klein in second place. Barnes said that today was the toughest stage yet, and that she does feel tired after today. She mentioned that she’d started today’s race feeling almost feverish at the start line, and had been worried about her performance potential; but after a few kilometers, she regrounded and was able to take advantage of today’s flat spaces. Laurence had said that she’d had a more difficult time than normal acclimating to the desert temperatures this year, but each stage seems to be finding her footing more and more. USA’s Liza Howard came in third today, mentioning that today’s headwind and her heavy pack made today a bit more rough. She “plugged along just fine,” though, and is meticulously planning her food timing in preparation for the long stage. Russia’s Natalia Sedykh and Britain’s Gemma Game took fourth and fifth places today, holding the same places respectively overall. USA’s Meghan Hicks finished today in tenth place, which brings her to an overall placing of seventh. Additional Information  Stage 2: Oued Tijekht to Jebel El Otfal (31.1 km) Stage 2 was Jebel Day, with the relatively short course crossing two significant jebels (rough hills) at Joua Baba Ali Jebel and El Otfal Jebel. That means it was a day that favored those the strong and technical runner rather than the merely fast. A day amongst the jebels. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Men — Stage 2 While things are always far from settled until the dust has settled on the long stage, the top three men this year appear to be sorting themselves out at least for these early 20-25 miles stages.Rachid El Morabitywon today’s 31.1km stage in 2:32. Unlike yesterday, he didn’t have anyone on his shoulder as he crossed the line asAbdelkader El Mouaziz(+2:54) finished nearly three minutes back in second.Salamed Al Aqraagain took third, a bit further off El Morabity, but about equidistant from yesterday’s gap back from El Mouaziz. However, today Al Aqra did lead through the first checkpoint at 12km before fading. Rachid El Morabity won Stage 2 of the 2015 MdS. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein In the biggest jump on the day among leaders, Morocco’sAziz El Akad(+5:12) moved from 11th in Stage 1 to fourth in Stage 2. He was also only five minutes off the lead today. It appears he’ll make a play for his sixth top-five MdS finish at this year’s race. Samir Akhdar(+11:48) andDanny Kendall(+13:04) went out harder today, both within two minutes of the lead in fourth and fifth respectively at 12km. Samir, who’s never finished in the top five overall at MdS, ended up fifth on the day and, now, sits in fourth overall, while Kendall finished about a minute behind him. Both gentleman are running a strong race and anything can happen, but both also appear to have a top end a level below today’s top four. Mohamad Ahansal(+18:22) went out quite conservatively today. He was in 11th almost five minutes off the lead at 12km before working his way up to seventh by the finish. Still, being 18 minutes off the lead today seems more indicative off an inability to compete with the top dogs this year rather than sound strategy for this multiple-time champ. The rest of the today’s top ten was rounded out by Americans and Europeans who all finished within a minute of one another.Dave Mackey(+20:32) andChema Martínez(+20:56) both went out relatively hard in seventh and eighth through 12km. Chema then pulled ahead by a few minutes by the 25km checkpoint before Mackey reeled him back in to take eighth.Antoine Guillon(+20:47) also reeled Chema in after being three minutes back at 12km and 3.5 minutes back at 25km. I’d look for Antoine to continue moving up. Abdelkader El Mouaziz, Salameh Al Aqra, Chema Martinez, and another run together early in Stage 2.

Christophe Le Saux dropped from ninth yesterday to 12th today. Men’s Stage 2 Results Full Stage 2 results. Men’s Overall Results Through Stage 2 Full overall results through Stage 2. Women — Stage 2 Well, it appearsElisabet Barnesis more than a one-hit wonder in this year’s MdS. It looks like she led Stage 2 from wire to wire. However, she did give up most of her 90-second lead at 25km to edge outLiza Howardby a mere 16 seconds at the finish. We’re not sure whether that’s due to fatigue or the tough terrain, which included a difficult jebel as well as almost a mile of sand dunes in that final 6.5 kilometers. Elisabet Barnes wins her second-straight MdS stage. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein While there was some yo-yoing time wise among the top women today… each of the top eight women already held her finishing position at both checkpoints at 12 and 25 kilometers. That’s pretty remarkable. The top five women also took the same positions they did in Stage 1. This may seem like a set up for a non-dynamic race… but just you wait until Wednesday’s long stage. France’sLaurence Klein(+15:50) again immediately ceded time to Barnes before finishing nearly 16 minutes off the lead. Either Klein has an entirely different strategy from her aggressive racing in past years or she’s just not in the fitness to win again. We’ll see come the long stage in two days. Natalie Sedykh(+23:40) andGemma Game(+24:15) once again took fourth and fifth on the day, respectively. Heck, they pretty much ran the same exact stages as each did in Stage 1 with the same gaps off the lead, as well. Natalie was the more aggressive of the two. She was just four minutes off the lead and 40 seconds off third-place Laurence at 12km before fading. On the other hand, Gemma was Steady Edwina through the stage, making up much ground on Natalie late. Anna-Marie Watson(+32:45) moved up a spot today to take sixth in an even effort. She swapped yesterday’s positions withMeghan Hicks(+38:01), who slowed some after the first checkpoint. The UK’s Rebecca Ferry (+45:56) jumped into the top ten today after taking 12th yesterday.Melissa Venables(+47:50) andClaire Morrissey(+50:43) swapped positions from yesterday with Melissa taking ninth today as she moved up through the field during the stage. At the moment,Jolanda Linschootenlooks like a non-factor for the top five. After taking eighth yesterday, she was 12th today. She was over an hour off the lead today and is an hour and 45 minutes off the overall lead after two stages. Women’s Stage 2 Results Full Stage 2 results. Women’s Overall Results Through Stage 2 Full overall results through Stage 2. iRunFar Field Report – From Kirsten Kortebein Stage Two of the 2015 Marathon des Sables was–as can be expected–a hot one. Morale in bivouac seems high, but today’s strong sun and technical terrain seem to have tired out even some of the top competitors. Stage Two’s course contained multiple jebel climbs and descents on fairly loose rock, a flat oued, and small dune fields. As I write, a large sandstorm is looming–everyone here is crossing their fingers that it will pass by, but the runners are doing their best to secure their tents in preparation. Women’s Race Elisabet Barnes took first place again today in the women’s race, staying strong throughout the day. Navigating the stage’s jebels seemed to have been a little more of a challenge for her, and she took a bit of a wrong turn while traversing the jebel between CP2 and the finish line. USA’s Elizabeth Howard, who had stuck with Elisabet for the majority of today’s stage, did pull ahead at this point–but once the two had descended and entered into the small dune field before the finish, Elisabet powered past Howard for a strong finish. Howard is cheerful post-race and had “lots of fun” during today’s stage, particularly enjoying running the ridgelines and technical downhills. France’s Laurence Klein came in third today and rests in third place overall. She’s staying very focused before the next stages. Russia’s Natalia Sedykh and Britain’s Gemma Game stuck and finished today’s stage close together–in fourth and fifth places, respectively–and Britain’s Anna-Marie Watson and USA’s Meghan Hicks finished in sixth and seventh. Liza Howard earns second during Stage 2 of the 2015 MdS. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Men’s Race Morocco’s Rachid El Morabity took the win yet again during today’s stage, setting and holding a solid pace throughout the course. He is cheerful in camp but very focused, which is especially evident when he crosses the finish line. Morocco’s Abdelkader El Mouaziz came in second today; he did indeed seem to have a harder time with today’s stage than yesterday’s, seeming tired in comparison to Stage One. The top competitors consider him to be a real force to reckon with, but are predicting that the long stage may be quite difficult for him. On the other hand, Jordan’s Salameh Al Aqra is feeling very well–healthy, rested, and confident–and finished today’s race in third place. Finishing behind Salameh was Morocco’s Aziz El Akad. He put in some serious leg work today; he seems in good spirits, and is now sitting in seventh place overall. Samir Akhdar said that he struggled a bit with today’s heat and technical terrain, but found his rhythm once he stopped trying to keep pace with El Morabity. Finishing behind Samir was Britain’s Danny Kendall, who says he had more energy during today’s race than yesterday’s, during which he had felt sluggish. Mohamad Ahansal’s left knee was bothering him quite a bit during the steep descents in today’s stage… he joked that he’s running this MdS “with one leg.” He is staying relaxed, and will take the rest of the race as it comes. Other Information  Stage 1: Jebel Irhs to Oued Tijekht (36.2 km) Stage 1 looks like a rough way to start off the Marathon des Sables with a few jebel (rough hill) crossings and a few kilometers of sand dunes. No matter the exact terrain, the first stage of the MdS provides runners the added challenge of their packs weighing their maximum. Even when the terrain is tougher later in the race, lighter packs can ease a runner’s physical and mental burden. On the upside, it was a mere 29C/85F with low humidity two hours into the first stage. While that’s hot for many Northern Hemisphere climes this time of year, that’s downright comfortable on the MdS course. Women — Stage 1 Holy Moly! Native Swede and UK-residentElisabet Barnesblazed the women’s field to kick off the 2015 Marathon des Sables. She finished the 36km stage nearly eight minutes ahead the next woman, the US’s Liza Howard. Barnes had a minute lead at the race’s first checkpoint at 13km, built that to four minutes by 25km, before adding another four minutes on the women’s field in the final 11km. Barnes has some strong ultra results in the UK, but from the (very) outside, it looks like this was a very aggressive first-stage performance when you compare Barnes’s marathon times in the 3 hours and teens over the past few years with the with pedigrees the likes of Liza Howard’s and Laurence Klein’s. Elisabet Barnes on her way to winning Stage 1. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Liza Howard(+7:57) did take second on the day, but after running through the first two checkpoints at 13 and 25 kilometers roughly a minute behind multiple-time championLaurence Klein(+10:40) of France. Either Howard kicked hard or Klein faded late, as Howard outran Klein by 4 minutes in the final 11 kilometers today. Two more new names,Natalia Sedykh(+23:16) of Russia andGemma Game(+24:54) of the UK, rounded out the women’s top five in stage one. Natalie hung with then third-place Howard through checkpoint 1 at 13 km and was still within 7 minutes of the women’s lead at 25km. She would finish 23 minutes back. Gemma ranmuchmore evenly that Natalia, as she was 10 minutes off the lead at 13km, 18 minutes off at 25km, and 25 minutes at the finish. That promises to be a much better long term strategy. Meghan Hicks(+36:19), the 2013 MdS champion ran evenly through the day. She finished sixth woman 36 minutes off the lead with the sort of even effort we’d expect out of Meghan. The UK’sAnna-Marie Watson(+44:49) moved up a great deal through the stage, from 14th at 13km to seventh at the finish. Meghan Hicks during Stage 1. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Of otherwomen we previewed before the race,Jolanda Linschooten(+45:43) of the Netherlands was eighth on the day after going out in 5th through 13km, while Ireland’sClaire Morrissey(+46:46′) finished in ninth, the position she held most of the stage. At this point Italy’sLuisa Balsamoand Spain’sEli Sanchez Britolook to be non-competitive in this venture. Full women’s results from Stage 1. Men — Stage 1 Yeah… the Moroccans. They, along with MdS regularSalameh Al Aqraof Jordan, crushed the first stage of the 2015 Marathon des Sables, with four Moroccans and Salameh taking five of the top six positions and leaving a slew of international-caliber ultrarunners from 20 to 35 minutes back… in a 35-kilometer stage. Wow! Last year’s champRachid El Morabityedged out countrymanAbdelkader El Mouazizby 15 seconds after being within seconds of one another throughout the stage. Rachid obviously has the power to continue this effort, while Abdelkader (a former 2:06 marathoner) similarly saw success in the “shorter” MdS stages last year before losing over 2 hours to the leaders on the much longer stage four. Rachid El Morabity edging out countryman Abdelkader El Mouaziz for the Stage 1 win. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein Having finished MdS nine times, won the MdS in 2012, and oft running in similar terrain in his Jordanian homeland, it’s no surprise to have Salameh Al Aqra (+3:08) finish third on the day. A three-minute deficit is an irrelevant rounding error at this point in MdS. Still, it could be telling that he was with the two leaders through at least 25km before falling back late in the stage.Chema Martínez(+5:39) of Spain was the top European on the day. A former track and road running star (2:08 marathon), we’ll have to see if Chema can sustain this sort of performance or if he’ll fall more in line with Adbelkader’s 2014 performance. Moroccan friendsSamir AkhdarandMohamad Ahansal(both +7:30) ran together all day to take fifth and sixth. With five MdS wins, Mohamad knows what he’s doing and Samir is smart to stick with him. Samir Akhdar and Mohamad Ahansal finishing Stage 1 side-by-side. Photo: Kirsten Kortebein And then there was a 10 minute gap. The UK’sDanny Kendall(+17:01) led the mortals with his seventh place finish on the day with an even effort. Switzerland’sMarco De Martin(+20:01) moved up the field through the day to take eighth. De Martin traded places late in the race withChristophe Le Saux(+21:24) of France, who also ran a well-paced stage.Dave Mackey(+22:54) of the US stayed roughly in the same spot all day before finishing in tenth. Stage one left some notable runners outside the top ten.Aziz El Akad(+23:07) of Morocco could only manage 11th, while having finished between second and fifth in all five of his MdS finishes. I was surprised to seeAntoine Guillon(+23:52) of France back in 12th after Day 1, although his talents are much better suited for the long stage on Day 4. Perhaps the biggest surprise on the day is Portugal’sCarlos Sá(+35:18) finishing more than 35 minutes off the lead in 15th. Sá was fourth at last year’s MdS. Full men’s results from Stage 1.

Sampers (c) MDS2015 iRunFar Field Report – From Kirsten Kortebein After a prep day filled with dust and reoccurring sandstorms, the 30th Marathon des Sables is finally underway. The competitors left base camp this morning a little after 9:00 AM BMT (the MdS has, like last year, opted to create an “MdS time zone” instead of staying on local time.) Today’s stage was 36.2 km, and included a solid range of terrain: flat rocky areas, a dried up oued, jebels, and small dune fields. Men’s Race Jordan’s Salameh Al Aqra led the pack through CP1, jostling for position with Morocco’s Abdelkader El Mouaziz and Spain’s José Manuel Martinez. Morocco’s Rachid El Morabity and Mohamad Ahansal followed quickly but calmly behind, with a smiling Samir Akhdar bringing up the rear. The front pack stayed relatively close together throughout the remainder of the stage; Rachid was ultimately the first to cross the finish line, looking calm and calculated despite Morocco’s El Mouaziz finishing just seconds behind him. Salameh came in third today, crossing the finish line with his trademark unfurling of the Jordanian flag. In fourth place, with a strong finish was Spain’s Martinez, who looked confident and happy throughout and at completion of this first stage. Finishing thereafter were Samir Akhdar and Mohamad Ahansal, Britain’s Danny Kendall, Switzerland’s Marco De Martin, France’s Christophe Le Saux, and USA’s Dave Mackey. Women’s Race First across the finish line in the women’s race was Sweden’s Elisabet Barnes, who finished today’s 36.2 km in 3h:45m:17s. Barnes felt strong through CP1 and CP2, but had a harder time from CP2 until the finish, largely due to the heat. Eight minutes behind Elisabet was USA’s Elizabeth Howard, who crossed the finish line looking serious but strong. Coming in third today was France’s Laurence Klein, who finished minutes after Howard. Finishing fourth was Russia’s Natalia Sedykh, and fifth was the UK’s Gemma Game. iRunFar Field Report – From Meghan Hicks[Added April 7, 6 p.m. MDT]There is simply no other place I’d like to be, late afternoon in the middle of the MdS bivouac. The heat of the day has yielded to the long shadows and cooler breeze of evening, runners streaming across the line still, a cornucopia of languages being spoken in every direction. We ran 36 kilometers today and though the heat and sand and sun beset us and though we’re limited to only the food in our packs, we are still fresh and peppy in our meanderings through camp. This morning, we awoke to a near­full moonset, and, tonight, we’ll be treated to a full­moon rise as the sun goes down. The bivouac reaches a half mile or more through the mountain-­filled valley in which we will tonight reside. Life is simple in the MdS, we have little and yet we need even less. It is good, no it is great and noble, the MdS. Tomorrow brings another day and a promise of only more. We will run, we will seek, we will find. Additional Information – Stage 1 Related articles:"

Shifting leaders all night and all day long, lots of interplay between competitors within the top 10, and ultimately, a huge number of drops from the race. It was the event that kept us guessing all the way until the end. For the race’s first 30-ish kilometers, a pack of four worked together as the leaders, composed of France’sAurélien Collet, China’sYan Long-Fei, Spain’sIker Karrera, and Norway’sSondre Amdahl. This group flew, and was immediately well under course-record pace, what would eventually become something like 20 minutes under record pace before halfway. It was an unsustainable pace for sure, as evidenced by the fact that only one of these four men finished, Sondre. In the 33k aid station, Sondre made a move to break from the group and take the lead, a position he would hold for another 30k. Then, Sondre’s pace yielded at the same time that Yan Long-Fei’s pace accelerated, and Yan took over the lead. Now it was Yan’s turn to lead the field, and he did this from around 62k until around 78k. Around the course’s high point, Pico de las Nieves, Yan suddenly pulled from the race, citing a headache. That was when Lithuania’sGediminus Griniusstepped up to the plate and into the lead, a position he would hold all the way until the finish. Gediminus ran what we would call a wise, tempered race. He wasn’t within spitting distance of the men’s top 10 until 30k in, and then he held tight around 10th place and the back half of the top 10 for another 30k. After that, he used about 20k worth of singletrack to make his way into the pole position. Once taking the lead around Pico de las Nieves, just before 80k, he simply stayed enough distance in front of everyone else through the finish. Like clockwork, his win today went.

We’d previously seen him race twice, running in the top 20 in both the 2014 IAU 100k World Championships and Les Templiers in 2014. His performances were solid, but steps below what he did today. Didrik’s race played out a lot like Gediminus’s, where he ran in only the top 20 through about 30k. After that, he, too, slowly worked his way through the men’s field. Didrik used the long descent following the course high point to pass a couple more people, pushing into second place, which he then held through the finish. What a breakout day for Didrik! Didrik Hermansen running his way toward second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell France’sAntoine Guillon(post-race interview) ran a bit more aggressively as compared to the other two men on the podium. By 30k, he was  already into the top 10, where he would stay all day. Like Didrik, Antoine used the long downhill between 85k and 100k to put the hammer down on some other guys who were suffering, making his way into that final podium spot.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Sondre Amdahl, after his hot early pace in the lead group and in the lead, slowed, regrouped, and soldiered on to fourth place. France’sCyril Cointrerounded out the top five. The U.S.’sAnton Krupicka(pre-race interview) was in the hunt for almost the entire race. Though he ran, at times, in the back half of the top 10, he was only minutes off the podium. He climbed as high as fourth place right around the race’s high point at Pico de las Nieves. But the late-race heat sapped his strength, and he slowed significantly in the final marathon, yielding a couple spots to finish sixth.Remi Queral(Spain),Freddy Thevenin(France),Marco Zanchi(Italy), andPiotr Hercog(Poland) rounded out the men’s top 10. Full results (pdf). When Spain’sNúria Picashas a good day, her MO is to start a bit conservative, and let other women do the early leading. Today was no different. Early speedsters and France countrymatesEmilie LecomteandCaroline Chaverotfilled that role. While Emilie would withdraw, perhaps succumbing to that hot pace, Caroline persevered on, slowing but not by too much. By 30k into the race, Núria had taken the lead, a spot she wouldn’t relinquish even though there were some 95k’s of racing still to do. She steadily built an almost-30-minute gap over the ladies field, then lost about 12 or 14 minutes of that buffer, then built part of it back again by the finish. We could see that, at times, her effort was a grinding, uncomfortable one, but her overall strength shone through today. Núria Picas, 2015 Transgrancanaria champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Second place Caroline Chaverot (post-race interview) suffered some mid-race stomach issues, perhaps related to her flying start. But once she got in control of those, she held steady in her podium spot. I’m not sure what was more fascinating to watch in Caroline today: her early confidence or her later regrouping and strength. Caroline Chaverot, who would eventually finish second. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Okay, we admit that, by the way China’sDong Li(post-race interview) was looking with 25k to go, we weren’t sure she would finish. She was hot and exhausted, in fourth position after running most of the race in the back half of the women’s top five. But if there’s anything we know about ultrarunning, it’s that revivals happen all the time, and her late-race performance was certainly one. Not only did she revive enough to finish, but she also climbed onto the podium and finished third. Really impressive, Dong! Dong Li, 2015 Transgrancanaria third place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Switzerland’sAndrea Huserran in third place for most of the race. But in the race’s final 25k, she slowed some, allowing for Dong Li to pass her. Brazil’sManu Vilasecarounded out the women’s top five. Manu’s race was another well-played one. She ran in the back half of the top 10 for more than the majority of the race, and then squeaked into the top five by staying strong late in the race as others slowed. Spain’sEster Alvestook sixth, Portugal’sLucinda Sousawas seventh, the U.S.’sAliza Lapierre(pre-race interview) was eighth, Spain’sRaquel Rivero Delgadowas ninth, and Spain’sSilvia Triguerosruns to 10th.

2015 MSIG Sai Kung 28k And 50k Results,"[Editor’s Note:This article was written by guest contributorKoichi IwasaofDogsorCaravan.com.] TheMSIG Sai Kung 28k and 50ktook place yesterday in Hong Kong, hosting the inaugural Asia Skyrunning Continental Championships. This was also the 2015 Skyrunning season kick off. In the 28k Skyrace, Japan’sDai Matsumotoand Italy’sElisa Descofollowed the course carefully and won the race. In the 50k Ultra SkyMarathon,Samir TamangandMira Rai, both Nepalese, dominated on the demanding, technical trail. Below you’ll find our play-by-play summary as well as race results. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with links to related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. One of the legends in Skyrunning, Italy’sMarco De Gasperi, led for the first part of his first race in Hong Kong.  Unfortunately, he took a wrong turn at a fork about 10 or 11k into the race. He says he maybe missed four minutes, and when he came back to the course, he spotted two Japanese runners ahead of him. Those two runners wereDai MatsumotoandYoshihito Kondo. Kondo says, “I just tried not to miss Matsumoto because he came to Sai Kung for recon last month. But Matsumoto has good skill on technical downhill, and I gave in to his lead.” Getting a lead from a global legend and a local running buddy, Dai Matsumoto won the 28k race in 2:49:23. Yoshihito Kondo finished second, just two minutes back from Matsumoto. Marco De Gasperi took third and says, “I regret my mistake, but really love this tough and challenging race.” Fourth and fifth places were the U.K.’sTom Owensand Australia’sDavid Byrne. Japanese runners took four places in the top-10 men. Japan’s Dai Matsumoto on his way to the MSIG Sai Kung 28k win. All photos: iRunFar/Koichi Iwasa Elisa DescoandStephanie Jimenez, both from Italy, made it quite the race for the 28k win. The pair dueled each other, and Desco’s lead to Jimenez at CP3, 22k into the race, was just 10 seconds. At the finish line, Desco won and Jimenez followed in second only 43 seconds later.Kanako Hasegawaof Japan took third, andChiaki Fjelddahl, from Japan but residing in Hong Kong, was fourth. Again, Japanese female runners showed presence.

As we often see in Hong Kong, Nepalese runners excelled, winning both the 50k Ultra SkyMarathon men’s and women’s races in the Asia Skyrunning Continental Championships.Samir Tamangdominated all through the 50k, and looked relaxed at the finish line. He says, “I was not on [my] expected time today, but happy to start this year with great success.” For China’sYan Long-Fei, it was a rough race. His strategy was to follow the leader until the middle of the course. But he also took a wrong turn to CP2/18k, and when he got back to the course, he was in fifth. He started chasing the leaders, but did not know that Tamang was leading just a bit ahead of him. Long-Fei finished second, three minutes from Tamang. Third place, Spain’sCristofer Clemente, and fourth place, Australia’sBlake Hose, ran steady. BothMiki Ushida, from Japan, and the U.S.A.’sLuke Nelsonran smart races, taking fifth and sixth from around 10th in the early miles. Please allow us to mention that three Japanese got into the top-10 men of the 50k! Nepal’s Samir Tamang, the 2015 MSIG Sai Kung 50k champion. The women’s 50k winner wasMira Raiof Nepal. We should say that she ran the most successful race yesterday. She not only dominated the women’s 50k but she also took sixth overall. Her lead against China’sDong Liexpanded toward the finish. Dong Li andKasie Enman, of the U.S.A., were steady in second and third place. Italy’sAlessandra Carliniran patiently, and moved up to fourth place from farther back in the women’s top 10 early on. I am proud to have Japan’sShiho Iwadatein fifth, one of two Japanese in the women’s top 10.

2015 Tarawera Ultramarathon Results,"The seventh edition of theTarawera Ultramarathon, the second race of the 2015 Ultra-Trail World Tour, took place on the New Zealand’s North Island today.Dylan Bowman(post-race interview), of the United States, and New Zealand’sRuby Muir(post-race interview) out ran the rest of the field to become this year’s champions. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and preview on our Taraweralive-coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to Tarawera-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Thanks to Ultimate Direction for supporting our coverage of the 2015 Tarawera Ultramarathon! Last year’s second-place finisherYun Yan-Qiao, of China, took the pace out hot from the start line, leading with ferocity for almost the race’s first half. It was an effort that he couldn’t sustain, however, as he dropped from the lead by 47k and out of the race after 60k. That was when the U.S.’sDylan Bowman(pre-race interview) stepped into the leadership position, and quite frankly, on the gas. It was less than 10k later that Dylan had distanced himself from the rest of the men’s field by nine minutes. Over the next 20 or so kilometers, he would increase that lead by a minute or two at a time per checkpoint. And, in the final 10-ish kilometers, he put a few more minutes on the rest of the field, finishing with a 16-minute berth. All day, he looked smooth and collected, whether it was on the tech-y terrain of the cool morning early on, or on the runnable, hot fire roads later in the race. His finish re-set the course record by more than 45 minutes. Dylan Bowman on his way to the 2015 Tarawera Ultramarathon win. All photos: iRunFar/Bryon Powell The U.S.’sJorge Maravilla(post-race interview) ran a smart race start to finish. In the early part of the race, he and Dylan hung together and just a bit out of the leadership limelight, leapfrogging and sometimes running with each other. After spending the middle part of the race dancing around a couple positions in the top five, Jorge found his way to second place by 60k. From there, it was steady as he goes where he, like his training partner and friend, Dylan, separated himself from the rest of the men’s field, eventually crossing the line with an 11-minute margin over third place. Marin County, California, the homeland of Dylan and Jorge, was certainly well-represented in New Zealand today! Jorge Maravilla, second place in the 2015 Tarawera Ultramarathon, gives and gets a hand. Japan’sYoshikazu Harastarted the race relatively conservatively early on, somewhere in the back half of the top 10. Each time we saw him, however, he wanted to know what position he was in. Over the course of the day, he moved up into the top five, stayed there for a few checkpoints, and then pushed his way into the third position in the race’s final third. His focus, determination, and positive attitude start to finish were clearly key aspects of his race. Yoshikazu Hara gives it to finish third in the 2015 Tarawera Ultramarathon. New Zealand’sVajin Armstrongalso took things easy early on and then moved up into fourth place in the final kilometers of the race. The U.S.’sMichael Wardianhad a great run, too. In the middle miles, it looked as if he was suffering a bit, working hard to hang onto seventh position. Eventually, however, in the flatter road miles of the final kilometers of the race, he used his leg speed to move into fifth position. Pau Bartoló,Robbie Britton,Chris Truscott,Anthony Hancy, andAndrius Ramonasrounded out the men’s top 10. Full results. Whoa ho ho, what a women’s race! It was exciting all day, thanks to the antics of women’s championRuby Muir(pre-race interview), of New Zealand! In the early miles, Ruby just flew, setting a hot pace and running her way into the overall top 10 by 37k into the race. Even though she clearly covered the terrain with ease and efficiency, she’s been recently injured and we couldn’t help wonder if she could hold that effort. At 37k in, she was seven minutes ahead of the other women. At 60.5k, she was just five minutes ahead. At 70k, her lead was 2.5 minutes. At 78k, it was just under two minutes. At 83k, it was three minutes. And at around 90k, she was tied for the lead of the race. That lit a fire in her belly, however, and she sped off to the finish, putting 12 minutes on her nearest competition in those last 10 kilometers. Hungry for the win, we’d say! Her effort also improved the course record by some 85 minutes. Ruby Muir bounding through the early miles of Tarawera. Ruby’s challenger was a fellow Kiwi (though one living in Taiwan),Ruth Croft(post-race interview). As late in the race as 37k, Ruth was running with and near other women in the top five. However, by 60k into the race, she had built a 10-minute gap over the rest of the women’s field that would only grow larger. From the outside looking in, it seemed that Ruth had waves of running really hard, and then not looking so well for a spell. In the end, Ruth didn’t have enough to challenge Ruby all the way to the finish, but she had plenty to make a dent on the international ultrarunning community with her second-place finish. Ruth Croft, 2015 Tarawera Ultramarathon second place. Spain’sNúria Picas(post-race interview) came into Tarawera with just a couple days of running training, and a couple months of winter cross training under her belt. All day she looked steady, strong, but just not as sharp as the women in front of her. Until after 37k, Núria ran among other women in the top five. By 60k in, however, the top-two women had spread in front of her and the rest of the field spread behind. It would be like this–she running solo–through the finish. At the finish, she humorously joked, “No train, a lot of pain.” Núria Picas in the early-morning light as she runs toward third place at Tarawera.

2015 Vibram Hong Kong 100k Results,"The fifth edition of theVibram Hong Kong 100ktook place today, and China’sYan Long-Fei(post-race interview) and Hong Kong’sWyan Chow(post-race interview) go home with the respective men’s and women’s wins earned through commanding performances. Below you’ll find our play-by-play summary as well as race results. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to HK100k-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. China’sYan Long-Feiseemingly knew what he wanted and went after it from the get go, never running outside of the men’s top five after a short distance into the race. Purportedly a road runner with a 2:15 marathon PR turned trail runner only in the last year, Long-Fei made even, calculated progress to the front of the pack by a third of the way through the race. Up until somewhere before the 90-kilometer mark, he shared that lead with eventual second placeSondre Amdahl, who hails from Norway. At 90k in, however, Long-Fei had broken Sondre, gained a five-minute lead, and went on to shave off a little more than two minutes from the 2012 course record of 9:54:57, set byRyan Sandes. With his bold runs in the last year through Asia and his leg speed, it will be interesting to see where he is able to take his running on the trails. Long-Fei Yan, 2015 Vibram Hong Kong 100k men’s champion. Photo: iRunFar/Koichi Iwasa Like Long-Fei, Sondre Amdahl took it out hard and kept his foot on the gas all the way through the race. Sondre ran no lower than eighth place after the initial out-of-the-gate hustle, and he very quickly made his way into the top position, which he shared with Long-Fei for nearly half the race. Though the pair was clearly running and working together, at times one leading the other before reversing, Sondre eventually lapsed back by about five minutes between the 83k and 90k aid stations. In the last 10k, he gave up another couple minutes, finishing about eight minutes back of Long-Fei, but far set apart from the rest of the field. If this is any indicator of of Sondre’s season, 2015 is going to be a very good running year for him. Sondre Amdahl celebrates second place. Photo: iRunFar/Koichi Iwasa For the first 30k, France’sAntoine Guillonran in a completely opposite style from that which his Euro racing brethren is wont to do. He took off easily, and spent the first third of the race way outside of the top 10, barely in the top 30, even. It wasn’t until 36k into the race that he arrived to a checkpoint inside the top 10. However, by the 52k aid station, Antoine moved into the third position, a spot he would maintain with seeming ease and a quiet smile all the way to the finish. Antoine Guillon, 2015 Vibram Hong Kong 100k third place. Photo: iRunFar/Koichi Iwasa Cyril Cointre, another Frenchman and Antoine’s WAA Ultra Equipment teammate, finished fourth whileJordi Gamito, of Spain, made it inside the top five. Full results. Like her men’s-champion counterpart, Hong Kong’sWyan Chowwent out steady and kept her pace all day. In the first half of the race, she toyed around with positions inside the top five. Like steady clockwork, she moved into second position before 36k and the lead position by 65k. From then on, she maintained a moderate and successful separation from the rest of the women’s field. Her 12:34:56 represents the third-fastest time run on this course. Last fall, Wyan set a local record by being the first woman to run under 13 hours on a mixed team at the Oxfam Trailwalker 100k, a famous and longstanding Hong Kong team ultramarathon. Clearly, her upward trajectory is just getting going. Pui-Yan Wyan Chow, 2015 Vibram Hong Kong 100k women’s champion. Photo: iRunFar/Koichi Iwasa China’sDong Liwas the most aggressive (but in the end still successful) runner of the day. She ran off the front from the get go, setting herself minutes apart from the other women through the 65k point where she was overtaken by eventual winner Pui-Yan. From there, though Dong had lapsed to second, she stayed with it and no other woman could touch her heavy-duty effort. She’s another new trail ultrarunner, but it seems like we’ll be seeing more of her. Dong Li flies to second place. Photo: iRunFar/Koichi Iwasa Lisa Borzani, of Italy, rounded out the women’s podium.

2014 TNF EC 50 Mile Championships Results,"The 2014The North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Mile Championshipstook place today in the California’s Marin Headlands. It wasMagdalena Boulet(post-race interview) andSage Canaday(post-race interview) who took home big victories and, perhaps, even bigger $10,000 paychecks. In addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and preview on our TNF 50live coverage page. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to TNF 50-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. You know,Sage Canaday(pre-race interview)generally makes our sport look easy. He wins or lands on the podium at almost every race he runs and, while he always looks focused and determined, he also seems to always look cool and in control. But today, in the last 10 miles of the race, we saw a different Sage. Face straining, arms and hips driving with ferocity, and an expression so concentrated he couldn’t make eye contact with anything but the ground ahead. I think he was only a couple heartbeats per minute away from foaming at the mouth! An absolutely enormous men’s pack held tight until somewhere around mile 20, something like 30 or 40 guys at mile 11 and 15-ish guys and mile 20 close together, leading out the race. In that pack was Sage, who emerged at its front somewhere before 18 miles. At the next aid station, at around mile 23, Sage had gapped all the men by a minute. From there on out, he was a man ablaze. Little by little his chasers were mostly whittled away, but not by big gaps, just seconds here and there. There was one guy who wasn’t going settle for second without a really good fight, and that wasDakota Jones(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). From mile 23 through mile 45, Dakota hovered within a minute of Sage, and even passing him briefly at mile 38. It seems like Sage went to the well to stay in front of Dakota and the rest of the field, working it for his $10,000 winner’s payout. Sage Canaday smiling about his win at the 2014 TNF EC 50. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Dakota, on the other hand, seemed to be the cool, collected, and smooth one all day. Make no mistake, we’re sure he was putting serious effort into his race, it’s just that he looked a little more calm in doing so. Dakota and his long-lasting relationship with this race, including a previous second place, earned his second second this year. Dakota Jones returning to Cardiac Aid Station, mile 35, in second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell While the local Marin County men brought it with three finishes in the top 10, it wasAlex Varner(post-race interview) who ran the fastest, looking absolutely strong from gun to tape. He was the guy who we pegged would pick someone off if Sage or Dakota blew later in the race. Unfortunately for Alex, neither of them did. But fortunately for Alex, his performance was significantly stronger than any of the dudes behind him. The final podium spot in a race as competitive as the men’s field: a huge, huge day for Alex. Alex Varner and Tim Tollefson celebrate top-10 finishes with Jorge Maravilla and Dylan Bowman in the background. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I’m not going to lie,Tòfol Castanyerdidn’t look so good after the 50k mark. His stride looked solid and efficient, but his breathing was ragged and fast in comparison to the runners around him. Nevertheless, he seemed non-bothered, holding that fourth-place position, which he stepped into at somewhere around the race’s halfway point, through the finish.Dylan Bowman(pre-race interview)said he was going to go to the proverbial pain cave to earn his race, and we heard that, at times, he wasn’t feeling perfect on course. Despite this, he stayed strong all day for his second fifth-place finish.Ricky Lightfootfinished sixth,Jorge Maravillaseventh,Tim Tollefsoneighth,Michael Aishninth, andTimothy Olson10th (pre-race interview). As a demonstration of the men’s field depth for this race, have a look below at places 11 through 20 and the fact that was under an hour’s different between first and 20th place. What a race! Full results. Oh wow!MagdalenaBoulet(pre-race interview)andMegan Kimmel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)put on an amazing show! The pair, who finished first and second respectively, ran within a minute of each other for more than 50k. Seemingly working each other, by mile 14 the pair started to put little dents of time on the rest of the women’s field, separating themselves and engaging in their own duel. In Magda’s debut ultramarathon here last year, where she finished second, she looked, at times, wide-eyed and a little timid about the scene. But today Magda had a different attitude: it was the eye of the tiger, all business in the front AND the back, all grit and speed, from start to finish. By mile 6 and basically from then forward, Magda set the pace and, it seems, called the race shots. Only once did we see a little deviation from Magda’s apparent confidence when she told us around mile 35 that she was worried because Megan was so close behind. But never did she physically falter, and her strength showed even more as she used the last quarter of the race to pull away from even Megan, too. Magda Boulet crosses the finish in first with her son. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Megan, who has been twice foiled by the challenges of this race in a DNF in 2012 and finishing off her potential here last year, really nailed her race this time. The only thing she couldn’t match on the day was Magda’s late-race power, as she, too, stayed separate from the rest of the women’s field. As a shorter-distance trail runner with a mountain focus, I can’t help but wonder what Megan’s going to do with her trail ultrarunning talent, given that she pretty much nailed this race. Meghan Kimmel racing in second at Stinson Beach. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Early on, until after mile 11,Stephanie Howe(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)ran within seconds of both Magda and Megan, but she soon seemed to fall into a proverbial no-woman’s land, a good chunk of time behind the front two and a good chunk of time in front of the rest of the field. Even though she ran with no nearby female company, her performance was solid from start to finish and she earned the final spot on the podium while battling a head cold through the race.

2015 Western States 100 Lottery Results,"The lottery for the 2015Western States 100was held today, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few elites. However, most elites either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. Let’s start with those who already have entry. The WSER website hasa full list of the 2015 Western States 100 entrants. (Initially, this list will contain pre-lottery entrants only, and it will populate with the entire field in the coming days.) The women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2015. Everyone one from last year’s women’s top 10, with the exception of France’s Nathalie Mauclair, who finished third, will return for the race’s 2015 edition. The men’s top 10 from 2014are also invitedto return. Like the women, nine of last year’s top-10 men plan to be back in 2014. The single non-returner is Max King, who finished in fourth place. A few top international runners gained entry via theForeign Resident – Special Considerationroute. Among these are Julien Chorier, of France, who won Hardrock in 2011 and took second this year, and who is a multi-time winner of the Diagonale des Fous. A stellar addition to the field is France’s François D’Haene, who in the last couple of years has moved into world-domination mode at the longer ultramarathon distances. Included in this passel of victories for 2014 are wins at the Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji, Ultra-Trail Mount-Blanc, and Diagonale des Fous. Lithuania’s Gedimimius Grinius has surged onto the global scene this year with a fifth place at UTMB and a fourth at Diagonale des Fous. Several other top-10 contenders gained entry via anotherAutomatic Entryroute: A total of 273 names were drawn during today’s lottery, and among them were a small number of high-level athletes: Top runners still have two routes by which they can gain entry into the 2015 Western States 100: Montrail Ultra Cup Up to 20 runners will be able to run their way in at the following 2015Montrail Ultra Cupraces: At each race, up to two men and two women will be awarded spots. A change was made to the 2015 Montrail Ultra Cup from the previous year; through 2014, 30 spots were awarded to Western States through the MUC, but for this year, only 20 spots will be awarded. After the announcement of the 2015 Montrail Ultra Cup, Western States 100 Race Director Craig Thornley previously explained to iRunFar how the extra 10 spots would be distributed in 2015: “Five of those entries have been reabsorbed into the standard WS100 Lottery process to be applied to all applicants, and five will be allocated to sponsor use to be outlined later. So stay tuned for that announcement later.” Western States President Tim Twietmeyer announced today at the lottery that the five additional spots will be awarded to runners entered in the lottery who run one of the five Montrail Ultra Cup Races.  Each race will conduct a drawing to determine the one runner from their race to be granted an entry. Ultra-Trail World Tour For 2015, six slots will be given to top international contenders via the Western States 100’s participation in theUltra-Trail World Tour. Details on who will be awarded these UTWT slots in 2015is forthcoming. Related articles:"
2015 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,"Congrats to everyone who gained entrance to the elusive 2015Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run. Let’s be clear, Hardrock isn’t a race, per se. It’s a ‘run.’ But it’s one of the hardest and most aesthetic organized 100-mile ‘runs’ on this planet. So attractive is this run that 1,367 people applied for the lottery for the 2015 run, up from 1,279 folks for the 2014 run lottery. Prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants in divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with Hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. The divisions are ‘First-Timers’ from which 47 spots in the run were given, ‘Veterans’ from which 35 spaces were given, and ‘Everyone Else’ from which 70 spaces were given. This totals 152 runners, a 12-runner increase from the 2014 race which originates from 12 more spots being given to ‘First-Timers’ than last year. Even though this event is called a run and not a race, there are some men and women each year who attempt to run the course faster than everyone else in that year’s run and, possibly, faster than the course record. Below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2015 contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in, who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in, and who the unlucky, un-chosen runners were. The excitement on the men’s side certainly comes from returning champion and course record holder,Kilian Jornet, going head-to-head againstIker Karrera,Adam Campbell, andAnton Krupicka. Potential party spoilers includeChris PriceandTroy Howard,both of whom have run well here in recent history. Throw in a fitJason Koop(DNF from hypothermia in ’14, high enough on a waitlist that he’ll probably get in) and seasoned veterans such asScott Jaime,Jared Campbell, andKarl Meltzer(also high enough on a waitlist that he’ll probably get in), and this race will be as fast and competitive as last year. On the women’s side, three-time championDarcy Piceuwill be challenged by Hardrock veteran and last year’s runner-up,Betsy Kalmeyer, as well as a fast and hungryAnna Frost, who blasted through her first 100 miler this fall with a win and course record at the Bear 100. This duo, combined with consistent HR performerDarla Askew, four time winnerDiana Finkel(currently waitlisted but with a good shot of getting in), as well asBethany Lewis(also waitlisted but potentially low enough that she might not get in) who is undefeated at the 100-mile distance, and the women’s race should provide just as much drama as the men’s. Here we go! There’s only one way to bypass the lottery to get into Hardrock: by winning the previous edition! 2014 winnersKilian JornetandDarcy Piceuhave automatic entries into the 2015 run and both of them have chosen to use those entries. Here are the high-level men who have a spot in the 2015 run: Here are the high-level women who have a spot in the 2015 run: Here are the male contenders who were chosen in the top-20 slots of the First-Timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These men have a good shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. Here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-20 slots of the First-Timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the Veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the Everyone Else waitlist. These women have a decent shot of running. Here are some fast men who weren’t chosen in the lottery or are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. There are also a bunch of fast women who entered the lottery, but have little to no chance of running Hardrock in 2015. Related articles:"
2014 IAU 100k World Championships Results,"The 2014IAU 100k World Championshipstook place today in Doha, Qatar. The USA’sMax Kingtook home the men’s win in 6:27:43, a new 100k North American record.Ellie Greenwood(post-race interview), racing for Great Britain, handily took the women’s race in 7:30:48. Team USA took home the men’s team title, while Team Great Britain secured the women’s team victory.

Thanks toHoka One Onefor sponsoring iRunFar’s coverage of the race. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. Both eventual champions, Max King and Ellie Greenwood, spent the first part of their respective races as stalkers of sorts, sitting a little distance behind the early leaders, chilling, watching, biding their time. In Max’s case, the early leaders, eventual seventh placeVasiliy Larkinand fourth placeHideo Nojowere running several minutes below world-record pace. So while Max was lodged firmly in the chase pack, he and others there were still running world-record pace for at least 20 kilometers. Somewhere around 45 kilometers in, Max broke from the chase pack and, then, between 60 and 65 kilometers in, took over the lead. From there, it was the king’s show. While his pace had slowed to over world-record pace, he hovered on pace to finish between two and six minutes below the now former North American 100k record, in the end improving the record of 6:30:11 set byTom Johnsonin 1995 by close to 2.5 minutes. Max King, 2014 IAU 100k World Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Sweden’sJonas Buudsure knows how to finish second in the 100k world championships, as his finish this year represents his fourth. In typical Jonas fashion, he ran the first 10k outside the top 10, and then slipped into the center of the men’s chase pack by about 20k. There he would simply keep running, checking off remarkably unvarying splits while members of the chase pack splintered off and early leaders dropped back. By 80k, Jonas assumed second place, where he would hold steady through the finish. There was one set of splits, between 85 and 90k, where Jonas put close to a minute’s dent into Max’s lead, but he would then lose that gain back in the final 10 kilometers. In the end, consistency paid off for Jonas once again. Jonas Buud earning second at the IAU 100k World Championships for the fourth time. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell What a day for Spain’sJose Antonio Requeijo! It seems that, prior to today, his 100k PR was 6:57, which he set in finishing third at the 2013 IAU 100k European Championships. Now, a 20-minute improvement yields a third place at the 2014 IAU 100k World Championships. Jose ran for something like 70 or 80 kilometers with countrymateAsier Cuevas, who was the last world championship’s fourth-place finisher. When Asier dropped back, Jose held steady and onto the last podium spot. Jose Antonio Requejo, 2014 IAU 100k World Championships third place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Japan’s Hideo Nojo was one of the early leaders, running below world-record pace. This isn’t the first time he’s tried this, as he did the same at the Lake Saroma 100k in Japan earlier this year. In both cases, he fell off record pace by a lot but still finished strong, this time in fourth place in 6:39:21. Imagine what he could do if he tried to run something closer to an even split? Japan’sYoshiki Takadaran outside of the men’s top 10 for a long portion of the day, moving up late along with another late-race pusher, AmericanZach Bitter. The fruits of their labor earned them respective fifth and sixth places. Early leader, Russian Vasiliy Larkin, held onto seventh, Italy’sAlberico Di Ceccotook eighth, AmericanZach Millerninth, and Finland’sFritjof Fagerlundtenth. Full results(alsohere). Out of the gate, America’sAmy Sproston, the defending 100k world champion, seemed hungry. While she didn’t lead straight away, she took over the women’s leadership position not long after 10k and held it until somewhere before the 45k point. Amy would finish the race but well out of contention. While there were several other power plays made by women during this time, the U.K.’s Ellie Greenwood seemed content to sit back and watch them happen. Somewhere right before the halfway point, Ellie ran herself into the leadership position. Ellie told us before the race that the day wasn’t about time, that it was about placing. Once she took the lead, it seems like she kept a conservative approach about it. Her lead slowly and steadily increased, by a matter of just seconds per 5k lap. It wasn’t until the last couple laps that Ellie’s gap over the field grew to the nearly eight-minute lead with which she would finish. With her victory, Ellie secures her second IAU 100k World Championships title. Ellie Greenwood, 2014 IAU 100k World Champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Japan’sChiyuki Mochizukiand the U.K.’sJoZakrzewskiboth ran a textbook races. They, too, sat out the early power plays, moving into the middle of the top-10 women before halfway and then into the second- and third-place positions by the 50k point. From there, like Ellie, they held tight to their places, running almost-even splits all the way through and securing the other two spots on the podium. Chiyuki Mochizuki finishes in second place.

2014 Les Templiers Results,"Though their races played out as almost opposites, France’sBenôit Coriand Spain’sNúria Picas(post-race interview) both emerged as 2014Grand Trail des Templierschampions, Benôit’s first win and Núria’s third straight.

From leaders changing hand over and over, to runners leapfrogging lots of places, this year’s men’s race was entertaining from start to finish. Hot off the start line was, well, pretty much all of the top men. The first time we spotted them about eight kilometers into the race, Poland’sMarcin Świerc, the U.S.’sZach Miller, and the U.K.’sRickyLightfootwere leading a huge men’s pack. At 21k, these three men remained the leaders, though Zach swapped into the point position. When Zach moved into the lead, he stayed there for the next approximately 50 kilometers. Each time we saw him, he was really working it: huge effort, huge output, huge smile. Well, that is until the very end of the race when the smile disappeared and an expression of discomfort took over. About 5k from the finish, Zach ran out of gas. Between there and the finish, he was passed by four men. He eventually stumbled over the line in fifth place and a full 15 minutes off the winner. A quick recovery and his smile was back, however. Benôit Cori moved his way into third place by a marathon’s distance into the race, took over second place by 64k, and assumed the lead from the fading Zach just before 70k. Benôit’s had some strong national-level performances in France the last couple years, and his performance today was a true breakout from that. Benôit Cori, 2014 Grand Trail des Templiers champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Second through fourth placesSylvain Court(France),Alex Nichols(U.S.) (post-race interview), andSage Canaday(U.S.) all also fit into the wise-racing category. Sylvain and Sage spent most of their days in the back half of the men’s top 10, working their way up as the race progressed. And Alex was out of the men’s top 30 at 21k into the race, though he found his way inside the top 10 by the marathon mark. From there, it was only up the rankings for him, as well.

Whereas Beniôt Cori’s win was a last-minute, come-from-behind victory on the men’s side, Núria Picas’s third-straight Grand Trail des Templiers win originated from a place of full-race control, almost from the start to the finish. WhileMaud Gobertheld the early lead, pushing the pace, Núria hung just behind, comfortable. Núria took over the lead somewhere before 31k, a lead she grew as the race went on. By the finish line, she had carved a nine-minute gap from the rest of the field. Núria Picas, 2014 Grand Trail des Templiers champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Juliette Benedicto(France) and andMagdalena Boulet(U.S.) (post-race interview) dueled all day. The pair came into the 21k aid station in second and third within minutes, and they would appear in this order at every aid station after that, sometimes a minute or more apart, sometimes just a couple seconds. As late as the 67k aid station, Juliette retained the narrowest of margins. At the finish, they were about two minutes apart, Juliette besting Magdalena. Juliette Benedicto went on to finish second at Grand Trail des Templiers. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Maud Gobert, of France, ran away with an early lead. Her fast pace eventually slowed and she eased into the fourth-place position. For the race’s entire second half and through the finish, she ran like clockwork, however, steady as she goes.

By the middle of the race, she charged up the top-10 rankings, eventually into fifth place. She passed Maud after the final aid station to move into fourth, before being passed back to finish just 17 seconds behind Maud in the end.

Desde el liderato que no paraba de cambiar, a corredores saltando montones de posiciones, la carrera masculina fue entretenida de principio a fin. La primera vez que vimos a los líderes alrededor el kilómetro 8,Marcin Świercde Polonia,Zach Millerde EEUU, yRicky Lightfootdel Reino Unido lideraban el gran lote de hombres. En la marca de los 21k, estos tres hombres se mantenían al frente, pero con Zach liderando. Benôit Cori. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Cuando Zach se movió a la posición líder, se mantuvo aproximadamente por 50 kilómetros. Cada vez que lo vimos, lo estaba haciendo bien: gran esfuerzo, gran semblante, gran sonrisa. Bueno, eso hasta casi el final de carrera en el que la sonrisa desaparecio y la expresión de disconfort se apoderó de él. A falta de 5k para el final, Zach se quedó sin gasolina. Entre ese punto y la meta, fue sobrepasado por cuatro hombres. Finalmente, atravesó la línea en quinto lugar y a 15 minutos del ganador. Sin embargo, tras una recuperación rápida su sonrisa volvió. Benôit Cori se movió al tercer lugar pasada la distancia del maratón, tomó el segundo lugar a los 64k, y arrebató el liderato del desvanecido Zach justo antes de los 70k. Benôit ha tenido actuaciones sólidas a nivel nacional en Francia en los últimos años, pero su performance del día es sin dudas un verdadero salto. Sylvain Court. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Del segundo al cuarto lugar,Sylvain Court(Francia),Alex Nichols(EEUU), ySage Canaday(EEUU), también encajan en la categoría de carrera prudente. Sylvain y Sage pasaron la mayor parte del día en la segunda mitad del top 10, acercándose a su posición final progresivamente. Y Alex estuvo fuera del top 30 pasados los 21k de carrera, pero se encontró dentro del top 10 al pasar el maratón. Desde allí, sólo fue escalando posiciones hasta el final. Miguel Herasde España, ínscripto de último momento en la competencia, parecía jugar sus cartas con tranquilidad, corriendo y terminando en mitad del top 10.Emmanuel Gault(Francia),Clement Petitjean(Francia),Marcin Świerc(Polonia), yJonas Buud(Suecia) cerraron el top 10.

Les Templiers 2014 – Carrera Femenina Mientras que el triunfo de Beniôt Cori fue progresivo y ganado casi a último minuto entre los hombres, el tercer triunfo consecutivo de Núria Picas en el Grand Trail des Templiers llego desde un lugar de control absoluto, casi de principio a fin. Si bienMaud Gobertlideró los primeros kilómetros de carrera, empujando el paso, Núria se mantuvo detrás, confortable. Núria tomó el liderato antes del kilómetro 31, y aumento su diferencia con el transcurso de la carrera. Ya en la meta, tuvo una trabajada diferencia de nueve minutos sobre el resto de las competidoras. Núria Picas. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Juliette Benedicto(Francia) yMagdalena Boulet(EEUU) batallaron todo el día. Ambas llegaron al avituallamiento de los 21k en segundo y tercer lugar separadas por minutos, y arribarían de esta manera en todos los avituallamientos restantes, a veces con algún minuto más de diferencia, a veces separadas por sólo segundos. En el avituallamiento del km 67, Juliette retenía un pequeño margen. En meta, arribaron con dos minutos de diferencia, siendo Juliette quién supero a Magdalena. Maud Gobert de Francia, partió con el liderato. Su paso rápido eventualmente ralentizó y la retrasó al cuarto lugar. En la segunda mitad de la carrera y hasta el final, corrió de manera prolija y constante. Juliette Benedicto.

Superó a Maud luego del último avituallamiento para colocarse cuarta, pero al final volvió a ser superada para terminar en quinto lugar a sólo 17 segundos de Maud.

2014 Diagonale Des Fous Results,"For the second year in a row, France’sFrançois D’HaeneandNathalie Mauclairdominated the men’s and women’s races, emerging as champions of the 2014Diagonale des Fouson Réunion Island. Ps. To get all the latest ultra news from iRunFar.com,subscribe via RSSoremail. From pretty much the start to the finish–and just like his other 2014 performances at the Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji and Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc–François D’Haene led with an unmistakable, unbeatable quiet confidence. For the race’s first 40 kilometers, however, François had lots of company, early pace pushers with whom François seemed content to let run the early show. At each aid station, however, François was there, either right with whomever was leading or on their shoulders. After 40 kilometers, however, those earliest leaders began to lapse back and François emerged as the singular leader. At first his lead was small, but it grew minute by minute at each aid station until there was no one–just he and this crazy race’s course. With arms upstretched and some 24 hours after starting, François crossed the line as the Diagonale des Fous winner for the second year in a row. Francois D’Haene, 2014 Diagonale des Fous champion. Photo: Salomon Running This year’s second-place finisher, FrenchmanLudovic Pommeret, surprised us with a standout performance. At just 90 minutes back of one of our sport’s best 100-mile runners in a race as long as this one, Ludovic proved himself as competitive among the world’s best. A conservative start had Ludovic out of the top 25 for the first kilometers and not into the men’s top 10 until around 30 kilometers into the race. From there, it was hold steady, full steam ahead for Ludovic. Kilometer by kilometer, Ludovic moved up through the field until 133 kilometers in where he assumed his second place. Ludovic has been a strong mountain runner in Europe for quite some time, but this result was far and away his best performance. Another standout run on the day was from France’sAurelien Colletin his third-place finish. Aggressive is the best descriptor for his run. It was as if he knew exactly what he wanted from the get go–a podium spot–and he fought for it from start to finish. His statistics from the race read like a course in consistency. He basically ran in second, third, or fourth place from just a couple kilometers in through the finish. Arelien’s finish was not without drama, however, because fourth place’sGediminus Grinius, of Lithuania, was hot on his heels in the final seven or so kilometers. This year will finish as a huge one for Gediminus, as it includes a fifth place at UTMB and a fourth place here. What will 2015 bring for him. Javi Dominguez,Patrick Bohard,Stefano Ruzza,Kenichi Yamamoto,Guy Noel Lebon, andJason Schlarbfinished fifth through 10th places. Full results. What can we really say about Nathalie Mauclair’s race? She full on schooled the women’s competition, the course, and all but 17 of the men’s competitors, too. Just like François but with nary a challenge from the women’s field at any point in the race, Nathalie led from start to finish. She has fully skyrocketed onto the world ultrarunning scene in the last 18 months, and her second Diagonale des Fous victory in a row adds fuel to her rocket’s fire.

Though there were other women in the mix for the balance of the podium in the race’s first two thirds, it wasJuliette BlanchetandUxue Frailewho stayed strong as others dropped back. The pair played leapfrog in the race’s final third: Juliette overtook Uxue with about 40 kilometers to go; Juliette put some minutes on Uxue in the next 20 kilometers; Uxue made a late run to gain back those lost minutes in the final 20k; and the pair sprinted to the finish. In the end, it was Juliette who held off a fighting Uxue in that final sprint, crossing the finish eight seconds ahead. Christine BenardandMélanie Roussetfinished fourth and fifth, whileAlexandra Clain,Denise Zimmerman,Helene Haegel,Sophie Blard, andBertille Faurefinished out the second half of the women’s top 10.

2014 Limone Extreme Skyrace Results,"EritreanPetro Mamuhit the front at a super-fast pace and never relinquished first place to win the final edition of the 2014 Skyrunner World Series Skyrace Series at theLimone Extreme Skyracein 02:14:25. Second place wasKilian Jornet, having done the VK the evening before his legs weren’t as fresh, but he closed in fast on Mamu in the final 10 kilometers and reduced his two-minute lead to 30 seconds by the finish. In third place five minutes behind Jornet wasDavid Schneider. But in some ways it was Jornet’s day, as this sealed the Skyrace Series and his third Skyrunner World Series title for 2014, having already won the VK and Ultra Series. Maite Maioraworked her way steadily from an early fourth place to win in 2:47:05 two-minutes ahead of second-placeStevie Kremer. Third place wasElisa Desco, who fought hard and, literally, hit the deck at the finish. Kremer wraps up the season as the Skyrace Series champion.

Set amidst beautiful Italian lakes, the final edition of the 2014 Skyrace Series started and finished on the shores of Lake Garda in Limone. Limone is relatively short in distance at 23.5k, but tough on elevation with 2,000 meters of vertical gain, traversing three mountains, Bocca dei Fortini (1,200 meters), Monte Traversole (1,441 meters), and Coma Vecchia (1,415 meters) before descending back to Limone. With a downpour the night before, humidity was high leaving it warm and sticky for race day with the race starting at 1:30 p.m. outside the line of restaurants, pizzerias, and pleasure-boat docks in Limone Centro. Petro Mamu is not a well-known name, but he came into this race as the 2014 Mountain Running World Cup winner having also placed seventh at the 2014 World Mountain Running Championships last month. Also, he has a marathon PR of 2:25:37 set in his home country in May. So, take heed, this guy has mountain credentials as well as speed. His game plan was to lead from the gun and that is exactly what he did. The first two kilometers suited him as it undulates, but, boy, was he flying when he hit the first climb! By the time 10k had past, he had a two minutes lead on Jornet, Schneider, andMarco De Gasperi. Petro Mamu wins the 2014 Limone Extreme Skyrace.

Desco and Limone VK winnerChristel Dewallewere lying in fourth and fifth places, respectively. Maite Maiora, 2014 Limone Extreme Skyrace Champion. Photo: Ian Campbell At Monte Traversole (1,441 meters), there is a long and technical descent back to Limone, and it was here that Jornet made up 90 seconds to Mamu who was racing hard to maintain his well-fought lead. Mamu hung on and arrived at the beach to stride his way along amid applause from the crowds and then sprinted along the finishing funnel to hit the winner’s tape. Not once did he look back, but only 30 seconds later Jornet came to join him high-fiving the crowds, enjoying the moment that he had won the Skyrace Series and his third Skyrunner World Series title in one year. This has never been done before and, perhaps, it’s never to be done again. Kilian Jornet on his way to second place and a win of the 2014 Skyrace Series.

Orgué had dropped down the field and Maiora had worked her way up past Kremer and stretched out her lead to two minutes by the finish. Kremer was not going to give in and toughed it out to take second place ahead of Desco by three minutes. Desco had worked hard all day and by the time she arrived at the finish line, she had nothing left, collapsing to the ground. Elisa Desco after putting it all out there to finish third.

2014 The Rut 50k Results,"The second running ofThe Rut 50kwent down this weekend with some of the world’s best trail runners facing off on the slopes of Lone Peak in Big Sky, Montana under awesome autumnal skies. By the time the scree had settled,Emelie Forsberg(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andKilian Jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) were the winners, both becoming the Ultra Skymarathon Series champions in the process. As usual, we’ll be updating this article with links to The Rut 50k-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. Thanks toSalomonfor sponsoring iRunFar’s coverage of the race. Ps.

In the early going, Sage went out hard, putting a few minutes on the field over the relatively fast first third of the course. However, when he hit the first technical climb on talus, Kilian quickly closed the gap, passed Sage, and never looked back. While there were easier miles to be had late in the course, Sage’s hard early effort left him unable to make up any ground on victor Kilian. Sage Canaday and Kilian Jornet after The Rut. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Many went out hard, including a bunch of fast local runners.Manuel Merillas(post-race interview) ran to his own strengths, which had him in the top 10 in the race’s first third, but toward the back of that group. At mile 12, he was in seventh, but then the real climbing started and he was in fourth by mile 18. After the long climb to the Lone Peak summit, he remained in fourth behind Kilian, Sage, andTom Owens. By the marathon mark, Merillas had made his decisive move past Owens into third place, which is where he’d finish. Manuel Merillas in fourth while ascending Lone Peak.

The women of Salomon went out in front and never let up en route to filling the podium. Somewhat surprisingly,Emelie Forsbergstarted building a convincing lead almost from the gun, doing so on flatter, less-technical terrain than she prefers. Once she hit the technical terrain mid-race, Emelie got excited and kept on rolling to the win. Emelie Forsberg leading on the climb up Lone Peak.

While Kasie would never reel Emelie back in, she did run her way to a strong, consistent second-place finish. Frost said she didn’t have “much race in [her]” on Saturday, but she had plenty enough to round out the podium. Anna Frost and Kasie Enman running together in second 7.5 miles into the race.

Rolling into mile 7 in fourth place and already significantly off the lead, it would have seemed that the yet-to-come technical terrain might sink Ellie’s ship. Indeed, in the later milesHillary Allenwould challenge her, but Ellie used her speed and determination to rocket down the final mountain to take fourth ahead of Hillary.

2014 TNF Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) Results,"With their respective wins at the 2014The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc,Rory Bosio(post-race interview) repeated as women’s champion andFrançois D’Haene(post-race interview) added yet another notch to his growing list of major international ultramarathon wins.

Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Front start to finish, the men’s race seemed to run like a master class put on by winner François D’Haene. At every glimpse we had of him between the start and La Fouly at 108k, François led or shared the lead with other men, with what seemed like almost no effort, physical or emotional. Then, between La Fouly and Champex-Lac and 122k, he acted quickly and decisively, putting a more-than-10-minute gap on the rest of the men’s field in only 14 kilometers. In doing so, François literally and figuratively slammed the textbook shut and schooled every other dude in the race. In the race’s final 40-odd kilometers, François built an additional lead on the field and a buffer on the previous course record held by last year’s champXavier Thevenard. In the end, his 20:11:44 was a new record by 22-ish minutes and a gap of almost 45 minutes to any other runner. If there was any doubt as to François’s ability with longer, mountainous ultras, there should be no more. He is among the world’s best in this realm. Francois D’Haene, 2014 The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc champion. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Tòfol Castanyer(post-race interview) ran the race with what looked like a plan: go out aggressively and stay aggressive all race long. He was among the leaders as early as Les Houches at 8k and as late as La Fouly at 122k. In fact, it was he, François, eventual third placeIker Karrera(post-race interview), and eventual DNFLuis Alberto Hernandowho ran together as a group for the race’s first two thirds. All four men took turns leading and following within the group, and it seemed like all the men had highs and lows through which they worked together. Eventually Luis fell from the back of the group and François went off the front and it was Tòfol and Iker left together. Tòfol and Iker sharing the race. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks In an awesome example of teammate-ship and friendship, the pair ran pretty much together all the way to the finish. At times, one would pull ahead or the other would drop behind, but always they met up again. They crossed the line together as well in 20:55:42, declaring for themselves a tie for second place. Tòfol Castanyer and Iker Karrera tying for second place. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Fourth-place finisherJason Schlarb(post-race interview) had one hell of a race, totally textbook for how an American runner could do this race right. He started easy, seemingly unconcerned about the wild, fast, early-race antics, running close to 20th place. Slowly , surely he moved up until he was 12th place at Lac Combal at 64k and fourth place when he arrived to Champex-Lac at 122k. Jason finished with some challenge, namely pressure from behind from fifth-place finisher and strong closerGediminas Griniusand his own body wearing out. Sixth place as well as eighth through 10th places are occupied by individuals who started the race way outside the top 10 and who finished within it. This includes sixth placeAndrew Tuckey,Carlos Sáin eighth,Bertrand Collomb-Pattonin ninth, andStéphane Brogniartin 10th. On the other end of the racing-style spectrum wasSondre Amdahl’srace story. He didn’t start near the front but it was only a few kilometers into the race that he made it there, and stayed there. Full results. Rory Bosio, oh Rory, what can we say about you except thank you for kicking the pants off a European race for the rest of us who haven’t figured out how to do these kinds of things just right. Rory didn’t lead from the get go; she instead let the early pushers of eventual second placeNúria Picas(post-race interview) and third placeNathalie Mauclair(post-race interview)do the heavy lifting. At every point in which we saw Rory in the race’s beginning third, she seemed content to hang on the proverbial shoulders of someone in front of her. Then, it seemed that her party line switched, and she put herself in the leadership position such that she was in it by several minutes already at Arnuva at 95k. Never did she relinquish her lead either, though she did have at least a couple rough patches along the way that slowed her from the record pace she was pushing for a while. Rory already won the hearts of the Euro endurance world with her first UTMB win last year, and this time she has sealed the deal on their love with her second UTMB win in a row. Rory Bosio, 2014 The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell I can’t help but think that Núria Picas really wanted the UTMB win after playing bridesmaid last year. Though Nathalie Mauclair did much of the actual early leading, it wasn’t long before Núria found her way into the lead, which she would hold onto for the race’s second third. When we saw her in early aid stations, such as Lac Combal at 64k, she was real, real serious, instead of the calm casual she usually runs with. It seemed she was in a serious-work mindset even early on. After the race’s first third, Rory took her lead back and kept it. It should be noted that, while Núria couldn’t compete with Rory’s talent and drive on the day, she did set herself apart from the rest of the field, finishing close to an hour in front of all the other women. She is an UTMB bridesmaid once more, still an awesome position to be in. Núria at La Floria just before finishing the 2014 TNF UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Nathalie Mauclair is always a pleasure to watch race. She usually starts aggressively and stays there as long as she can. Today was no different. Though Nathalie ran in the lead or in second place for a portion of the race, she eventually slid into third place where she would stay until the race’s end.

Con sus respectivos triunfos en la The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc 2014,Rory Bosiohace su doblete, yFrançois D’Haeneañade un triunfo más a su creciente lista de grandes carrera internacionales.Estaremos actualizando este artículo con resultados completos, como también con artículos relacionados a la competencia, galerías de fotos y reportes de carrera. Desde el comienzo hasta el final, la carrera entre los hombres se dio como una obra maestra dibujada por el ganador François D’Haene. Cada vez que pudimos observarlo entre la salida y La Fouly (108k), François lideraba o compartía dicho liderato con otro hombre, y parecía no estarse esforzando ni física ni emocionalmente. Luego, entre La Fouly y Champex-Lac y 122k transcurridos, actuó rápida y decisivamente, estableciendo una diferencia de más de 10 minutos del resto del lote en sólo 14 kilómetros. Habiendo hecho esto, François prácticamente selló la historia y se lo dejó en claro a los demás hombres. En los últimos 40 kilómetros de competencia, François amplió su ventaja sobre el resto del lote y también sobre el récord de circuito establecido por el campeón del año pasado,Xavier Thevenard. Al final, su tiempo de 20:11:44 es el nuevo récord de circuito por casi 22 minutos respecto al anterior, y le dio una diferencia de 45 minutos sobre los demás corredores. Si quedaba alguna duda de la habilidad de François en las ultras largas y montañeras, ya no debería existir. Está junto a los mejores del mundo en esta especialidad.

Foto: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Tófol Castanyercorrió en base a un plan: salir agresivamente, y mantenerse agresivo toda la carrera. Se conectó con los líderes temprano en Les Houches (8k) y se mantuvo hasta tarde en La Fouly (122k). De hecho, fueron él, François,Iker Karreray quién luego abandonaría,Luis Alberto Hernando, los que corrieron en grupo en los primeros dos tercios de carrera. Los cuatro hombres se turnaron el liderato del grupo, y parecía que todos iban teniendo altibajos mientras trabajaban en conjunto. Eventualmente, Luis quedó retrasado del grupo y François partió en solitario, dejando a Tófol e Iker juntos. Iker y Tòfol compartiendo la carrera. Foto: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks En un espectacular ejemplo de compañerismo y amistad, los dos corrieron juntos todo el camino hasta la meta. Por momentos, uno se apartaría delante y el otro caería detrás, pero siempre se volvían a encontrar. Cruzaron la meta juntos en 20:55:42, declarando ellos mismos el empate por el segundo lugar. Tòfol Castanyer e Iker Karrera empatando el segundo lugar. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell El corredor que ocupó el cuarto escalón en la general,Jason Schlarb, tuvo una excelente carrera, dejando escrito como debe hacer esta carrera correctamente un corredor Estadounidense. Comenzó tranquilo, despreocupado de los corredores que se apresuraron en los primeros kilómetros, alrededor del 20º lugar. Con calma, fue escalando puestos hasta ubicarse 12º en Lac Combal (64k) y luego 4º en Champex-Lac (122k). Jason finalizó desafiado, o si quieren decirle presionado, por la fortaleza de quién arribaría quinto y cerca de él,Gediminas Grinius, como también por su cansado cuerpo. El sexto lugar, como también del octavo al décimo, lo ocuparon individuos que comenzaron la carrera muy lejos del top 10 y finalizaron dentro de él. Esto incluye aAndrew Tuckeyen sexto lugar, aCarlos Sáen octavo,Bertrand Collomb-Pattonen noveno, yStéphane Brogniarten 10º. La carrera deSondre Amdahlentra en el polo opuesto de la historia. No comenzó cerca de los puestos de vanguardia, pero apenas unos kilómetros después logró colocarse delante, y así se mantuvo todo el tiempo. Rory Bosio, oh Rory, que podemos decir de ti además de agradecerte por haber logrado destrozar una carrera Europea para nosotros que nunca supimos cómo hacer bien este tipo de cuestiones.  Rory no lideró desde el principio, ella dejó que las que empujen desde el principio y hagan el trabajo duro sean las que luego ocuparían el segundo lugar,Núria Picas, y el tercer lugar,Nathalie Mauclair. En cada punto del primer tercio de carrera donde pudimos ver a Rory, se la vio contenta de moverse en las sombras de alguien frente a ella. Luego, parecía que su fiesta había comenzado y se colocó en el liderato a tal punto que en Arnuva (95k), tenía varios minutos de ventaja sobre las demás. Nunca renunció a su liderato aunque tuvo unos momentos duros en el camino, que la ralentizaron del ritmo de récord que llevó por unos minutos. Rory ya se había ganado los corazones del mundo Europeo de las Ultras con su primer triunfo el año pasado en UTMB, y este año selló ese amor con su segundo triunfo consecutivo en la UTMB. Rory Bosio, campeona de The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc 2014. Foto: iRunFar/Bryon Powell No puedo evitar pensar que Núria Picas realmente quería su triunfo en UTMB tras jugar el papel de dama de honor el año pasado. Pese a que Nathalie Mauclair fue la que tomó las riendas de la carrera temprano, no paso mucho tiempo hasta que Núria se encontró con el liderato, que sostuvo hasta el segundo tercio de carrera. Cuando la vimos en los primeros avituallamientos, tales como Lac Combal a los 64k, estaba muy, muy seria, a diferencia de la calma que lleva siempre cuando compite. Parecía estar en un serio trabajo mental desde el principio. Luego del primer tercio de carrera, Rory recuperó su liderato y lo mantuvo.  Cabe destacar que, si bien Núria no pudo competir con el talento y la conducción de Rory de la jornada, si se apartó del resto del lote, finalizando casi una hora delante del resto de las mujeres. Ella es la dama de honor de la UTMB una vez más, que igualmente es una posición fantástica. Núria en La Floria, justo antes de finalizar TNF UTMB 2014. Foto: iRunFar/Kirsten Kortebein Siempre es un placer ver competir a Nathalie Mauclair. Usualmente comienza de forma agresiva y se mantiene así lo mucho que pueda. Hoy no fue diferente. A pesar de haber corrido en liderato o en segundo lugar en una parte de la carrera, cayó al tercer lugar, que ocuparía hasta el final de la competencia.

2014 Matterhorn Ultraks 46k Results,"At the 2014Matterhorn Ultraks46k,Stevie Kremer,of the U.S., andZaïd Ait Malek, a Moroccan living in Spain, ran to respective wins against fast fields on a burly course but under the sunniest of skies and the watchful eye of the race’s namesake mountain.

From the gun, men’s champ Zaïd Ait Malek put himself in the running, arriving to the first two checkpoints, Sunnegga at 6k and Gornergrat at 14k, in second place. At the first checkpoint, he was breathing down the neck of early leaderAritz Egea, and then just 45 seconds back at Gornergrat. About half of the race’s climbing happens between the start and Gornergrat, some 1,770 meters/5,800 feet of climb. Whew! From Gornergrat’s lofty perch, Zaïd let it rip on the super-runnable downhill to Riffealp at 19k, passing and putting two minutes on Aritz during that 5k. After Riffelalp, the downhill continues to before another moderate-sized climb (for Europe) to Schwarzsee at 28k. We were stationed at 30k after Schwarzsee and saw Zaïd roll by four minutes ahead of any other runners. Then, again, with 5k to go, atop the last climb at about 2,700 meters altitude and between the Trift refuge and the town of Zermatt, he was six minutes ahead of any competition. At the finish, he had built a seven-minute buffer over the rest of the field, asserting his dominance over the runners here as well as this course.

Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Unlike Zaïd and Aritz’s more aggressive race tactics, Gion Bundi took the start much more conservatively, running in 9th through Sunnegga at 6k. On the long climb from there to Gornergrat, he moved up to fourth place before taking over third on the descent before 19k at Riffelalp. Somewhere between 30k and 41k, he was able to move even further up, into second position, which he would strongly hold through the finish. Third-place finisher Artiz Egea.

Women’s champ Stevie Kremer wasn’t afraid to let other women lead early on, sitting on their heels until the time was right for her to open things up. At Sunnegga at 6k, Gornergrat at 14k, and Riffelalp at 19k, Stevie ran just off the lead, in second and behind eventual second-place finisherElisa Descoat Sunnegga, in third place behindKasie Enmanand Elisa at Gornergrat, and still in third place behind Elisa and Kasie at Riffelalp. But then, but then! Somewhere in the long descent off Riffelalp and the climb to Schwarzsee at 28k, Stevie took over the lead. When we saw her at 30k just after Schwarzsee, she was more than a minute ahead of everyone else, and again at 41k, she was a full four minutes up on any other ladies. Her win was about four minutes faster than any other woman this year, and 23 minutes faster thanEmelie Forsberg’swin in the inaugural race last year, a new course record. 2014 Matterhorn Ultraks champ Stevie Kremer commanding the race with 5k to go.

After that she was passed by eventual winner Stevie, but it doesn’t seem like she ever gave up on gassing it. She was running hard and fast both times we saw her in the second half of the race, holding her own against every other woman but the winner.

Pacific Northwest ski-mountaineering expert Nick Elson has been applying his enthusiasm and skill in the last year to trail ultrarunning. After a DNF and a trio of podium finishes at other local ultras, Nick really put things together with his strong showing from start to finish in the Squamish 50 Mile. After running in the lead pack early and then staying among the top-three men after some men dropped back, Nick ran in second or first position for the race’s second half. After passing the 53k aid station tied with eventual second placeMike Murphy, Nick began to put time on Mike and the rest of the field, breaking away to a 10-minute victory.

Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Mike Murphy, last month’s champion of Vancouver’s famousKnee Knackering 30 Mile, ran–from the outside looking in–a similar race to Nick: out with the lead pack early, staying in the thick of things when the pack thinned, and then packing a punch at the critical moment in the race’s last third to rise to his second-place position. Like Nick, a strong showing from line to line. In the second half of the Squamish 50 Mile, Mike Murphy runs toward second place. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks Ed McCarthyalso ran aggressively from the gun, leading the men’s pack for most of the race’s first half. He began to drop from the leadership position to his eventual third place somewhere on the approach to the 53k aid station. There he’d fallen back from the co-leaders Nick and Mike, but began to fend off the balance of the men’s field. With two previous third places at the Squamish 50 Mile, he finished third for the third year in a row. Ed McCarthy in the forest before halfway in the 2014 Squamish 50 Mile. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Full results. Women’s champ Kim Magnus was last month’s winner of Vancouver’sKnee Knackering 30 Mile, and she went out among the women’s leaders in this race as well. Until just under halfway through the race, she ran in or very close to second place. At the 48k aid station, however, after making it up and over the race’s most extended climb, Kim emerged as the women’s leader, a position she would hold from there to the finish. Her first 50 miler was an outstanding performance! Kim Magnus, 2014 Squamish 50 Mile women’s champion. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell Kim faced pressure from the rest of the women’s field for virtually the entire race, especially from eventual second placeSamantha Drove. Until the final kilometers, Kim and Sam were not more than a couple minutes apart, with Kim generally running ahead of Sam. I’ll admit, to me Sam looked like she was working harder than the other women early in the race, and I doubted whether she would be there in the later kilometers. However, when I saw her at the 38k aid station, it seemed like her posture and approach had changed, and that she had become comfortable with her effort. What fun it was to watch her run in third place early, and second place late. Samantha Drove running for second place in the 2014 Squamish 50 Mile.

Cassie went off the line in typical Cassie style, at her own seemingly aggressive pace. This pace, she would say at the finish line, wasn’t one she could ultimately sustain due to her lack of fitness. Cassie pretty much led the race from the start through somewhere before 48k.

Today was the Sage Canaday show, start to finish, with him leading commandingly and the only exception to that being early in the first climb where he shared the lead for a little while. By the top of the first climb at Hidden Peak, mile 8.3, Sage held a three-minute lead over second place and a six-minute lead over third place. At each subsequent checkpoint, Sage extended his lead by a couple more minutes. When our team saw him during the race, he seemed quiet, calm, collected, but putting in a big effort. Longtime Speedgoat volunteers and afficionados said Sage was running sections of climbs they’d never seen people running before, like the digger climb up Mount Baldy which comes after the mile 19.4 aid station. Sage finished with a 19-plus-minute lead on the rest of the field, taking home a $5,000 check for his first-climb prime, his winner’s prize money, and his course-record prime. (The course was changed a bit from last year to this year–made a little harder–so Race Director Karl Meltzer set the course-record prime at 5:15, some six-plus minutes faster than Sage’s 5:08 and change course record from last year. Sage got under that magic 5:15 number.) Sage Canaday, 2014 Speedgoat 50k Champion.

By mile 14.8 at the Pacific Mine Aid Station, Alex and Paul showed up second and third, with a small gap behind them to the rest of the field. The pair quickly separated themselves from the rest of the field and begin a duel that would continue to the finish. Alex led Paul by a couple minutes through the mile 22.3 aid station, but then Paul ate away at that such that he was only 15 seconds behind atop the final climb of the day, at the Hidden Peak 2 Aid Station, mile 26. On the final, five-mile downhill, Paul made the pass and finished second by just over two minutes over Alex. What a race within a race! Paul Hamilton finishing second.

He then was 10th at mile 8.3 and just out of the top 10 at mile 14.8. And then the magic happened: sixth place at mile 19.4, fifth place at mile 26, and fourth place at the finish. I don’t know if it’s what he intended, but from the outside looking in, Rickey’s race seemed like a perfectly calculated, planned one. Mike Wolfe’s fifth place was another smartly run outing. On the first climb to mile 8.3 at Hidden Peak, Mike was nowhere to be seen inside the top 10, letting all the eager bucks go ahead. But by the almost-halfway aid station at Pacific Mine, he’d crept inside the top 10 where he would only move up, looking stronger and more confident than the other guys around him. LocalLars Kjerengtroenhad a heckuva day, finishing sixth and improving massively upon his 11th place here last year. Like Rickey Gates and Mike Wolfe, he, too, lingered outside of the top 10 until the long climb out of the Pacific Mine Aid Station, the rough halfway point. We’re not sure what happened back there, but Lars catapulted himself from about 15th place to seventh place within miles. Once he found his way to that spot, he would stay and finish that way, representing the Wasatch Front running community well. The Arizona racing contingent told us to watch out forCatlow Shipek, and they were right. Again, in what seemed like a calculated race, Catlow started things off easy, found his way into the top 10 in the middle of the race, and ran strong to stay there. What a solid showing on the national stage for Catlow today in his seventh-place finish! Eighth, ninth, and 10th places belong toJustin Yates,Galen Burrell, andTom Goth. Full results. Anna Frost ran away with the win today, but she clearly had to work for it. She took the first-climb $1,000 prime, arriving to Hidden Peak at mile 8.3 with a more-than-2.5-minute lead. She said that all the women were running easy on the climb, and so she decided to go for the cash. Anna Frost, 2014 Speedgoat 50k Champion.

On the next climb back up to Mineral Basin 2 Aid Station at mile 19.4 and onto the Tunnel Aid Station at mile 22.3, Kasie extended her lead to five and six minutes. For a little while there, it seemed like game over. Kasie Enman tops out on the first climb, on her way to second place.

Anna passed Kasie on that climb and put two minutes on her by the top. The two of them looked like night and day at the summit, Anna strong and Kasie gassed. But it turns out Kasie was only gassed on the uphills. She didn’t lose any time to Anna in the final descent, with Anna finishing just shy of two minutes in the lead and Kasie completing her first ultramarathon. Third placeEllie Greenwoodhad a rough start to her race. She arrived to the top of Hidden Peak, mile 8.3, having a hard time climbing at altitude. It wasn’t long into the descent that followed where she started to move up in the rankings. By the midway point, Ellie arrived in fifth place. And then, on the long climb back to the mile 19.4 aid station, she moved up into third position where she would stay for the rest of the race. She had to work for her position, however, given that there were a passel of women breathing down her neck the second half of the race, especially the eventual fourth-place woman.

Early on, Hillary ran in the back half of the top 10, but by the mile 22.3 aid station, she had climbed up into fourth spot and just a couple minutes behind Ellie Greenwood. That’s how it would go for the balance of the race save for the last descent. There, Hillary got off course and lost about eight more minutes to Ellie, finishing some 10 minutes back. Fifth placeKerrie Bruxvoortwins my award for the most calm woman all day long. It was hot, the altitude was high, there were lots of rocks and dust, and the climbing was brutal, but Kerrie just never looked fazed. She must really like the fifth position, because she spent much of her day there or in fourth place. Start to finish, a smart, chill race on Kerrie’s part. First local ladyBethany Lewisfinished sixth, a position a couple spots back from where she ran early in the race. After occupying third position for much of the race’s first half, she dropped into the back half of the top 10. Her crew said she was suffering a couple different ailments, but, despite this, she held onto sixth place and first local woman. Way to represent the Wasatch Mountains, Bethany!
