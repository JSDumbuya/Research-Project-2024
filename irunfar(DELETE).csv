The Saturday, October 12 vertical kilometer (VK) race and the Sunday, October 13 trail race marked the end of this yearâ€™s 12-race series that spanned seven countries.																					
It was a fitting end. Kenyaâ€™sPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andJoyce Muthoni Njeruwon the race, while Kipngeno and the U.K.â€™sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won the series. Kipngeno and Adkin earned â‚¬5,000 for their world cup wins, part of a â‚¬30,000 prize purse that paid money 10 deep.																					
TheWorld Mountain Running Championshipshappen every other year. The event was contested last year in Austria and will happen again in 2025 in Spain. Absent a world championships event in 2024, the Mountain Running World Cup Finals take on greater importance this year. The World Mountain Running Association administers both.																					
The Sunday, October 13 trail race was contested as part of theVal Bregaglia Trailrace. The course stretched 23 kilometers long and with 850 meters of climbing and 900 meters of drop on a point-to-point course from Switzerland to Italy.

Kenyaâ€™sJosphat Kiprotich(Kenya), this yearâ€™s Sierre-Zinal fourth-placer, pushed to an early lead, but with five kilometers to go, Franceâ€™sThÃ©odore Kleinwas an even bigger surprise leader. The 29-year-old Klein ran Sierre-Zinal this year too, finishing 205th.																					
Call that a bad day, though	 his better results include a third at this yearâ€™s European Off-Road Championships and a sub-30 minute 10,000-meter run as recently as 2021. Klein greatly outperformed that Sierre-Zinal result here.

Series leaderPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was right with Klein though, and Kipngeno was able to pull away over the raceâ€™s closing stages. Kipngeno won the race in 1:34:03, and won the series too. He was third in yesterdayâ€™s VK race as part of the weekend double.

Kipngeno raced seven times in the world cup this year. He won both Broken Arrow races at the start of the season, and won the Vertical Nasego and Trofeo Nasego races in Italy too as part of the world cup. Heâ€™s currently ranked second in the Golden Trail World Series ahead of that seriesâ€™s final next weekend in Switzerland.

The womenâ€™s race looked a lot like so many other shorter trail races this year. Kenyaâ€™sJoyce Muthoni Njeruwent to the front early and led for a lot of it. She finished in 1:47:45, just over a minute better than everyone else. It wasnâ€™t enough to seal the series win though, as she narrowly lost out to the previous dayâ€™s winner,Scout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)Â of the U.K.

2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals VK Results: Adkin and Elia Fastest to Top,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-mountain-running-world-cup-finals-vk-results,"After 10 races across seven countries, the 2024Mountain Running World Cupwraps up with a pair of finals on back-to-back days in Italy. Up first, theKilometro Verticale LagÃ¹ncran on Saturday, October 12, where the U.K.â€™sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Italyâ€™sAndrea Eliaemerged as uphill champions.																					
TheWorld Mountain Running Championshipshappen every other year. The event was contested last year in Austria and will happen again in 2025 in Spain. Absent a world championships event in 2024, the Mountain Running World Cup Finals take on greater importance this year. The World Mountain Running Association administers both.																					
A true vertical kilometer (VK), the uphill race gained 1,000 meters over 3.3 kilometers in distance. With a history dating back to 1986, it is the oldest VK race in the world. The course took runners from Chiavenna to LagÃ¹nc, Italy, and was run in a time-trial format with runners sprinting from the start every 15 seconds. It was a cool morning with some rain and mist, making for fine conditions, if a little bit slippery on some sections of the course.																					
Finally, this VK served as the 2024 Italian VK National Championships, which brought some additional competition.																					
Many of the runners doubled back on Sunday, October 13, to run theVal Bregaglia Trailrace to conclude the series. Read ourresults articlefor that full race story.

In all, the womenâ€™s fieldâ€™s start was spread over 46 minutes, and the top women started at the back of the field. World cup series leaderJoyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya) went third to last, and was followed from the start line by the U.K.â€™sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)Â and Kenyaâ€™sPhilaries Kisang Jeruto(pre-race interview). Adkin and Kisang, Muthoni Njeruâ€™s chief rivals in the series, were ranked second and third in the world cup before the race.

Further up in the start order, nearly 30 minutes before Muthoni Njeru started,Paola Stampanoni(Switzerland) was greatly outrunning her start position and passed more women than anyone else on her race to the top. In September, Stampanoni was second at the Skyrunning World Championships Vertical race.

The time-trial format makes finish ranks uncertain to spectators at the top, but both Adkin and Jeruto Kisang ran down favorite Muthoni Njeru and hit the high-point finish comfortably ahead of the series leader.																					
Adkin won the race in 37:57, ahead of Jeruto Kisangâ€™s 38:35. Adkin had a commanding 38-second lead when the finish times flashed. It was Adkinâ€™s third world cup win of the year, on top of a strong second-place finish at Sierre-Zinal this year.

Always on the podium, Jeruto Kisang had to settle for just that, another podium finish. Her runner-up spot matched last yearâ€™s silver medal at the 2023 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race.																					
Stampaniniâ€™s surprise early-in-the-race 39:13 split held up as third best.																					
Series leader and 2024 star across both the Mountain Running World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series, Muthoni Njeru was just fifth on the day in 39:55. That was, however, enough for her to hold onto her world cup series lead heading into the next day final race.

The men were second to challenge the mountain. The first man left the start line at 10:01 a.m. and another followed every 15 seconds clear up through 11:43 a.m. As with the women, the top men went last. The world cup series leader, Kenyaâ€™sPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), started fourth to last.																					
The U.S.â€™sJoseph Gray(pre-race interview), as with Kipngeno, a former uphill world champion, was seventh to last, and second in the world cup rankings. Kenyaâ€™sPhilemon Kiriago(pre-race interview), was ninth to last at the start line. As with the womenâ€™s race, there was rain and mist alternately throughout, making for wet terrain on the climb.

The world cup has been dominated by Kenyan runners this year, and the country had six runners in the field. At the finish, though, it was the host country that starred. Italy placed four runners inside the top seven.																					
When the race organizers laid out this start order, somehow they absolutely nailed it.																					
Just fifth at last weekâ€™sÂ 2024 Å marna Gora race in Slovenia,Andrea Elia(Italy) started the race second to last.Henri Aymonod(Italy), an uphill powerhouse who won last yearâ€™s race here, went last from the starting line.

Those two ran down Kipngeno, all the other Kenyan runners, Gray, and everyone else in front of them. Elia hit the top after 31:08 and Aymonod was only seven seconds behind in 31:15. Italy thus stood atop both the gold- and silver-medal podium positions.																					
Kipngeno, last yearâ€™s World Mountain Running Uphill Champion, was third in 31:50. As with Muthoni Njeru in the womenâ€™s race, that did score enough points to still lead the overall series heading into the next dayâ€™s final race on October 13.

Mammoth Trail Fest 26k Results: Joyce Muthoni Njeru and Elhousine Elazzaoui Dominate,https://www.irunfar.com/mammoth-trail-fest-26k-results-joyce-muthoni-njeru-and-elhousine-elazzaoui-dominate,"The eighth race of the 2024 Golden Trail World Series, and the last before the final, theMammoth Trail Fest 26kkicked off in Mammoth Lakes, California, at 10 a.m. on Sunday, August 22. The 16.1-mile course, starting and ending in Mammoth Village, has more than 3,900 feet of climbing and tops out at 11,053 feet, making it a proper high-altitude race.																					
Racers were greeted with cool, clear, and sunny conditions on race morning. The women started 20 minutes ahead of the men, providing them with their own race. Golden Trail World Series leaderJoyce Muthoni Njeruof Kenya took the early lead and never gave it up, finishing nearly three minutes ahead of Romaniaâ€™sMÄƒdÄƒlina Florea. In the menâ€™s race, the top four in the series standings ran together earlier on beforeElhousine Elazzaouiof Morocco andPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya pulled away over the summit of Mammoth Mountain and ran together for the rest of the race to a sprint finish, where Elazzaoui came away with the win.																					
The event is the queen event of the three-day Mammoth Trail Fest event. With a $21,000 prize purse up for grabs and prize money going 10 deep â€” as well as points leading into the Golden Trail World Series final up for grabs â€” the field was filled with some of the best shorter-distance trail racers vying for the top spot on the podium.																					
After leaving the village, the single-loop course climbs steeply to the top of Mammoth Mountain in the first 7.5 miles, gaining nearly all of its elevation in the span of three miles along the Dragonâ€™s Back. From the summit, it drops steeply to the McCoy aid station, tackling the new Bullet downhill, before starting a more gradual descent on mountain bike trails back into the village for a final romp through the streets to the finish line.																					
Joyce Muthoni Njeruof Kenya, the current leader of the Golden Trail World Series, didnâ€™t waste any time, taking off from the start to establish an early lead in the womenâ€™s race. By the first aid station at Twin Lakes, 3.6 miles and 25:21 in, but before any of the steep climbing, sheâ€™d already opened up an 18-second gap on second-placeMÄƒdÄƒlina Floreaof Romania and a 39-second gap on third-placeLauren Gregory.

Muthoni Njeru reached the summit of Mammoth Mountain, 7.5 miles into the race, at 1:14:29, leading Florea by more than two minutes. But coming over the top, Florea opened up her stride, not ready to surrender the race.																					
Behind them, on the steep, rocky, and switchbacking climb up to the summit of Mammoth Mountain,Rachel Drakeput in a huge effort to move into third over the summit, two and a half minutes behind Florea and with a 17-second lead onAnna Gibsonin fourth place. Gregory was just another 30 seconds back in fifth, the spots for the podium still up for grabs on the long downhill.																					
Florea held a fast pace on the initial miles of the downhill, looking to be running much more aggressively than Muthoni Njeru on the wider open sections on the ski resort, but was unable to close the gap. Coming into the McCoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles in 1:37:24, Muthoni Njeru held a 2:09 lead on Florea, while Drake and Gibson ran together another 4:38 back. Gregory was only a minute back from the duo, still within reach of third.																					
After McCoy, racers faced the Bullet downhill, a newly added section of steep and technical downhill on the course. The steeper sections didnâ€™t slow anyone down, and as the race reached the flatter mountain bike trails, Muthoni Njeru continued to hold a strong pace in the lead, reaching the Garage checkpoint at mile 14.8 in 1:56:45. Florea was 1:56 behind with a significant six-minute gap over third-place Drake and fourth-place Gibson, who continued to run together.																					
Joyce Muthoni Njeru cruised into the finish without any pressure with a time of 2:11:56, taking her third win in the series and further padding her overall series lead, and MÄƒdÄƒlina Florea finished second in 2:14:51, after taking a fall and cutting her knee. Anna Gibson used her background in the track to pull away from Drake on the gradual downhill to take third.																					
(In 2023, Ostrander was suspended for four months after testing positive for canrenone, a metabolite of spironolactone, after it was determined that she mistakenly took the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.)																					
Full results.																					
It didnâ€™t take long for the top four men in the Golden Trail World Series standings to separate themselves from the rest of the field.Philemon Ombogo Kiriagoof Kenya andRÃ©mi Bonnetof Switzerland pushed the pace on the relatively flat early miles, withElhousine Elazzaouiof Morocco andPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya chasing. The group came through the first aid station at Twin Lakes around 22 minutes into the race within 10 seconds of each other, and 15 seconds clear of the rest of the field.																					
Last yearâ€™s winner and course-record holder, Bonnet, was just 48 hours clear of winning the vertical kilometer (VK) race and had stated in a pre-race interview that he planned to stay with the leaders early on before launching an attack on the climb, hoping to create a gap big enough to hold off the rest of the field before the downhill. But when the climbing started, Elazzaoui, Kipngeno, and Ombogo Kiriago pushed the pace and opened up a gap on the defending champion.																					
Kipngeno was the first to the summit in 1:01:50, just three seconds up on Elazzaoui, who is known for his descending prowess. The duo had opened up a significant 1:40 gap over Bonnet, who looked to be struggling, potentially dealing with fatigue from his VK effort two days prior, and Ombogo Kiriago, who also dropped off the pace, another 40 seconds back.																					
In the early miles of the downhill, Elazzaoui let Kipngeno set the pace on the twisting singletrack, and the two came into the McCoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles together in 1:21:38. Elazzaoui continued to stay behind Kipngeno, letting small gaps open before cutting the apex of the corners, taking slightly shorter routes to repeatedly close the gap. When the two came to the new, and steep, Bullet Downhill section, Elazzaoui, who had been clearly biding his time, made his move and quickly opened a significant gap with only a few miles to go.																					
At the Garage checkpoint, Elazzaoui, who is not known for liking to lead alone, was back with Kipngeno with 2.3 miles to go, setting the pair up for a sprint finish. Behind them, Bonnet was three minutes back.																					
In the final streets, Elazzaoui opened up the sprint first, and when Kipngeno tried to get by on the inside of a corner, he found himself blocked by the Moroccan and had to hit the brakes. Elazzaoui took the win in 1:49:35 and also took the overall lead for the Golden Trail World Series going into the final. Ombogo Kiriago came in third ahead of last yearâ€™s winner Bonnet.

2024 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile Results: Mann Sets Course Record and Lockwood Secures Second Victory,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-run-rabbit-run-100-mile-results,"TheRun Rabbit Run 100 Milehas been a quintessential American fall 100 miler for years, both for its mountain fall scenery and competitive dynamics, and the 2024 edition was no different. In the menâ€™s race,Richard Lockwoodran away with his second win, backing up his 2022 victory with an even faster and more dominant performance. In the womenâ€™s race, CanadianEmilie Mannset a new course record by running 19:48:05, in doing so bestingMichele Yatesâ€™smark of 20:16:54, which had stood since 2013, by more than 27 minutes.																					
For 2024, the event experienced good weather, with warm daytime conditions leading to a cool to cold night, all normal for a mid-September weekend in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.																					
The Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile course is about 101.5 miles long, with 20,300 feet of climbing, and takes place at altitudes ranging from about 6,600 to 10,600 feet.																					
Uniquely, this event hosts two starts, one for the speedier â€œharesâ€ and another for the steady â€œtortoises.â€ The haresâ€™ race began on Friday, September 13, at 1 p.m. local time and had a 30-hour cutoff.																					
Also uniquely, this event hosts a huge prize purse â€” over $100,000 in total â€” with $15,000 going to the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s winners, prize money seven deep in both races, and a host of other dollars doled out for preems, a team event, masters and senior runners, and more.

In the early race miles, eventual menâ€™s champ and 2022 victorRichard Lockwoodseemed content to run as either the leader or a close chaser. To those of us watching from the outside, he seemed to be patiently passing the miles until the other men around him dropped back one by one. The last man fell behind somewhere before mile 71, and from there, Lockwood exerted utter dominance over the menâ€™s field. His lead grew slowly at first, and rapidly in the raceâ€™s final miles, until he crossed the line in 17:24:41. This was about 47 minutes clear of the second man and 35 minutes faster thanhis 2022 victory.

Menâ€™s second-place finisherAdam Loomisavenged a drop at this event last year with a solid start-to-finish performance that saw him pushing the menâ€™s leaders in the raceâ€™s first half before clearly demarcating the second-place position in the raceâ€™s final third. His 18:12:17 was well clear of third place.																					
With three prior finishes at this event, including fifth and sixth places,Christopher Hammesknows how to run this race. Letting some of the racing games happen around him while running in the middle of the menâ€™s top 10 for most of the race, he moved into his ultimate third-place position after mile 82 to finish in 18:56:34, close to an hour faster than his best prior finish. This follows a win at the 2024 High Lonesome 100 Mile less than two months ago.																					
Tyler GreenandNicholas Lightbodyrounded out the menâ€™s top five. With this finish, Green caps off a summer 100-mile double that saw him take seventh at the 2024 Western States 100 before finishing fourth at this race, and Lightbody continuing to develop his trail-ultra career, following up on sixth at the Black Canyon 60k and second at the Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile in 2024.																					
Full results.																					
In winning the womenâ€™s race,Emilie Mannof Canada made event history, setting a new course record and besting a record time that had stood for 11 years. Her approach was to chill among the lead women early, run a steady middle race, and totally slay the final miles. At the top of the first climb, Mann arrived among a passel of fast women, running a minute and change behind earliest leader and course record holderMichele Yates. As late as mile 89, Mann was still running in second place behind then-leaderLeah Yinglingbefore assuming the lead, running away with things, and finishing in 19:48:05, a win of over 30 minutes.																					
Second-place Yingling put up a heckuva fight, running among the top women early, assuming the womenâ€™s lead for some of the raceâ€™s middle to late miles, and ultimately taking second in 20:19:24, just 2.5 minutes shy of the prior course record. This possibly closes a big year of racing for Yingling, which has included participating in the lululemon FURTHER six-day event in the spring and taking 10th at the 2024 Western States 100 in the summer.																					
Shea Aquilanocrossed the line to finish in third place in the womenâ€™s race, but was marked later as a DNF. Her social media explains that she went off course for about two miles, but didnâ€™t know until after the finish.																					
Barrett Graywas, thus, retroactively moved up into third position, in what looks to be her 100-mile debut.																					
Nicole Laughtontook fourth, whileStacey Marionwas the fifth woman. For Laughton, this performance follows up on past wins at events like the Rocky Raccoon 100 Mile and Arkansas Traveler 100 Mile in recent years. And Marion caps off a big summer here following a finish at the Broken Arrow Skyrace 46k and a win at the Tushars Mountain Runs 100k.

2024 UTMB Results: A Course Record for Schide and a Surprise Win for Bouillard,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-utmb-results,"For the front of the field, the 2024UTMBis already history. The iconic UTMB course, with its 176 kilometers (109.3 miles) and almost 10,000 meters (32,500 feet) of elevation gain, has crowned new champions, as more than 2,500 runners try to encircle the Mont Blanc massif from Chamonix, France, through Italy and Switzerland, before finishing back in Chamonix.																					
In the womenâ€™s race, AmericanKatie Schidemade sure there were no similar surprises at the top of the podium. In a commanding, nearly wire-to-wire victory, Schide crossed the finish line in 22:09:31 to breakCourtney Dauwalterâ€™scourse record by 21 minutes, secure her second win at UTMB, and complete the Western States 100-UTMB double in the span of just over two months.																					
â€œWhen I went out fast this year, I wasnâ€™t afraid like I was in 2022,â€ Schide said after the race, referring to the first year she won UTMB. â€œFrom two more years of training, I had the confidence to run my splits.â€

KiwiRuth Croftand CanadianMarianne Hoganfinished in second and third, respectively, for a strong podium.																					
At the finish line in Chamonix,Vincent Bouillardput his hands on his head in disbelief and smiled toward the crowd: He had done it.																					
In one of the biggest â€” and most unexpected â€” breakthroughs in the history of the storied race, Bouillard, an unsponsored Frenchman who works in research and development for Hoka, won the 2024 UTMB in 19:54:23, to become the fifth runner to break the mythical 20-hour mark and cement his name in race lore.																					
â€œWinning UTMB was never expected,â€ said Bouillard, a former track and field athlete turned trail runner. â€œIâ€™ve been coming to this race since almost the beginning for my work, but only in my wildest dreams would I win it.â€

Those wildest dreams became reality on a hot day in France, which saw several of the pre-race favorites, including AmericanJim Walmsley, the U.K.â€™sTom Evans, and FrenchmanGermain Grangier, drop out. Bouillard, along with second- and third-place finishersBaptiste Chassagneof France andJoaquÃ­n LÃ³pezof Ecuador but living in Spain, took advantage of the opportunity to complete a podium that perhaps not many people predicted. But that, of course, is the beauty of ultrarunning, especially at a race as competitive and deep as UTMB.

After finally breaking through to become the first American man to win UTMB last year â€” with a course record, no less â€”Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) entered this yearâ€™s race as one of the clear favorites. He had also won, for the fourth time, the Western States 100 in late June to set up an attempt to become the first man sinceKilian Jornetin 2011 to win the Western States 100-UTMB double.																					
In his pre-race interview, Walmsley projected calmness and perspective. â€œThe cards that I have in my hand this year are different,â€ he said, â€œbut also, I wouldnâ€™t be lining up if I didnâ€™t think I had a chance to compete up front.â€																					
And for nearly nine hours, thatâ€™s exactly what he did. Walmsley, wearing bib No. 2, started with the pack but took the lead by 35k as the climbing â€” and night â€” set in. He ran at the front for the next several hours, stopping for two minutes at the Les Chapieux aid station (51k), and came into Lac Combal (70k) looking strong and still in the lead, leaving in less than 90 seconds.

But between there and Courmayeur at 83k, he began to struggle, dropping nine places to 10th and 13 minutes off the lead. As he entered the large aid station that serves as the near halfway point of the race, he looked rough. While the race leaders were efficient with their stops, Walmsley sat to eat for a relatively long time and did not look like he wanted to get up. He would later officially drop, a tough conclusion to a promising race for the champion. Winning the Western States 100-UTMB double still seems to be one of the most challenging feats in menâ€™s ultrarunning.																					
â€œJim has been struggling to shake a knee injury since Western States,â€ reada post on his Instagram story, â€œbut wanted to give himself the chance to see what the day would give him.â€																					
Walmsley was not the only of the pre-race favorites to drop out. The U.K.â€™sTom Evans(pre-race interview) â€” who followed up a third-place finish at the 2022 UTMB by winning the Western States 100 last year â€” had a very similar race to Walmsley, running near the front for the first half of the race and entering Courmayeur in second. He was part of a large chase pack that had passed Walmsley by 83k and spent less than three minutes at the large aid station, leaving in third behind FrenchmanGermain Grangier(pre-race interview) and eventual championVincent Bouillard(post-race interview), another Frenchman.

By Refuge Bertone at 88k, though, he began to look fatigued and though he remained in the top five until 101k, by Grand Col Ferret at 106k he had dropped 23 places to 28th. He would also later drop â€” another top contender out of the race.																					
â€œTom has sadly had to withdraw. He is okay and with family and friends,â€ read apost on his Instagram story. â€œFueling became an issue through the night and you canâ€™t run this race on empty.â€																					
The carnage, unfortunately, did not stop there, either. Grangier looked strong for more than 115k, running in second and charging up the hill at Grand Col Ferret at 106k and looking calm at La Fouly 10 kilometers later, only six minutes behind Bouillard. He stayed in second as the morning came, but looked fatigued by Trient at 146k, where he would also drop.																					
FrenchmenMathieu Blanchard, who famously battled Jornet at the2022 UTMB for a second-place finish, andAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-race interview), whowon both the Hardrock 100and Diagonal des Fous in 2023, both dropped at 69k, while Spainâ€™sPau Capell, the2019 UTMB winner, dropped at Courmayeur like Walmsley.

None of this is to take away from the brilliance of Bouillard or the other top finishers, who survived the historic carnage and heat to come away with some performances of a lifetime.																					
It starts and ends, of course, with Bouillard, who was on few peopleâ€™s radar when the race began. Last year, Bouillard, who does not even have a photo on hisofficial UTMB page, won the Kodiak 100 mile and Gorge Waterfall 100k, but few expected him to compete at the worldâ€™s most competitive trail race.																					
He did exactly that. Wearing bib No. 139, Bouillard ran in the lead pack at the start of the race, coming through Refuge de la Croix du Bonhomme at 46k in ninth, and methodically working his way up to the front, entering Lac Combal at 70k in second. By Courmayeur, he had taken the lead and spent less than three minutes refueling before heading back into the early morning darkness.																					
From there, he would not relinquish the lead, running the rest of the race relatively unchallenged as he continued to look strong and smooth as the sun rose. Later in the morning, he would cross the finish line to seal a strong and surprising win.

While Bouillard won by nearly 30 minutes, there was a true race behind him. Franceâ€™sBaptiste Chassagne(post-race interview) ran in the top 20 for most of the first 60k and entered Courmayeur in 11th. By 129k, he and fellow FrenchmanArthur Joyeux-Bouillon, who had taken the opposite approach by running at or near the front from the start, were within seconds of each other in fourth and fifth place, respectively, and 34 minutes behind Bouillard. Chassagne continued to look and run strong, entering Trient at 146k in second just ahead of the Ecuadorian living in Spain,JoaquÃ­n LÃ³pez(post-race interview), where he would remain until he crossed the finish line in 20:22:45 for his most impressive finish of his six-year streak of a top 10 at a UTMB Mont Blanc festival race.

LÃ³pez, meanwhile, had a very similar race to Chassagne, running in the top 30 at the start of the race before moving into 10th position by the time he left Courmayeur. Over the final half of the race, he moved up even further, and was just four minutes behind Chassagne at 161k. He could not ultimately catch him, but he did hold off Germanyâ€™sHannes Namberger(pre-race interview) to finish third in 20:26:22.

Namberger, a two-time top-10 finisher at UTMB, had another strong race to finish fourth in 20:31:54, looking like he might nab a spot in the top three with a fast finish.																					
The agelessLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) of France, who just over a month agoset the course record at the Hardrock 100, had another stellar performance, moving up from 47th at 40k, all the way to 10th by 100k, before picking off several runners in front of him to finish fifth in 20:57:48. It was his second straight fifth-place finish.																					
Joyeux-Bouillon held on for sixth, while AmericanCody Lindran into seventh position. Spots eight through 10 â€” Spainâ€™sManuel Anguita Bayoalong with FrenchmenGautier BonnecarrÃ¨reandYannick NoÃ«lâ€” were separated by only four minutes, with BonnecarrÃ¨re and NoÃ«l appearing to tie for ninth in 21:45:16.

Just two months ago,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), an American living in France,led the Western States 100 from wire to wire and nearly broke the course record en route to a commanding win. On Saturday in France, Schide somehow improved on that performance: She again won in dominating fashion, but this time also nabbed the course record to cap one of the most impressive doubles in ultrarunning history. (Of course, last year,Courtney Dauwalter, who did not race UTMB this year, won each race in the Western States 100-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple.)																					
In her pre-race interview, Schide, who lives and trains in France, admitted that her primary focus this season was on the Western States 100 and that she took the runnerâ€™s insurance for UTMB when she signed up in January in case she canceled.																					
After she dominated an impressively deep and competitive field on Saturday, though, it was hard to believe UTMB was not the top race on her calendar this year.

Schide went out fast and kept that assertive pace for nearly an entire day of running. She was 21st overall at the first aid station at 13k	 New Zealandâ€™sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Canadian living in FranceMarianne Hogan(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the eventual second- and third-place finishers were, respectively, 118th and 72nd overall there.																				
Schide did not take her foot off the gas and continued to run with her characteristic calm, strength, and smile, entering the Lac Combal aid station at 70k in 7:34, looking focused. By Courmayeur at 83k, she was 50 minutes under course-record pace and nearly 40 minutes ahead of Hogan, and by La Fouly at 116k, she was nearly an hour under record pace.																					
The only question from there was if she would set the record. With Hogan losing 10 minutes in 12 kilometers by 141k to fall to 40 minutes back, Schideâ€™s win seemed close to inevitable, especially with the way she was running. Just before Vallorcine at 158k, Schideâ€™s lead on the course record had lessened to 32 minutes and a few kilometers later she was working hard and taking encouragement from fans. With four kilometers to go, she smiled as the crowds cheered her on, knowing that history was just minutes away.																					
She reached Chamonix and the celebration began. Schide smiled to the crowd and gave several high fives before crossing the finish line more than 20 minutes faster than any woman had done before, and the double was complete.

If Schide was chasing history, Croft was chasing dozens of runners in front of her. Croft, who was forced to withdraw before the start of last yearâ€™s race due to illness, came into UTMB as one of the favorites, having won the Tarawera Ultramarathon and Transvulcania earlier this year. She ran conservatively at the start, coming through 31k in sixth place next to AmericanAmanda Basham, 22 minutes off the lead, and later falling to ninth place almost 38 minutes back just over 10 kilometers later.																					
But by 88k, with about half of the race in front of her, Croft had moved up to fifth, next toEmily Hawgoodof Zimbabwe, who lives in the U.S, and from there she kept moving up. At the Grand Col Ferret at 106k, she was in fourth behind Schide, Hogan, and2023 third-place finisherBlandine Lâ€™Hirondelof France, but Croft did not hang around: She broke into a run as soon as she started the descent.

By 129k, she had passed Lâ€™Hirondel and was in third place, looking fast and determined. At Trient, 17 kilometers later and about a half-hour behind Hogan, Croft was the only woman to run through the entire section and looked to be on the hunt.																					
By 158k, she had cut Hoganâ€™s lead to 14 minutes and looked the stronger of the two, flying downhill and making up time. Between there and the climb up to La FlÃ©gÃ¨re, Croft finally passed Hogan and left six minutes ahead. With four kilometers to go, she was in second and flying to the finish. Sheâ€™d reach it in 22:48:37, just over 22 minutes ahead of Hogan, in her debut at the race.																					
Hogan,who finished second in her 2022 UTMB debut, had another strong race, running in second for most of the day with a smile on her face, before fading late. She didnâ€™t let falling to third dampen her spirits, high-fiving fans and enjoying their cheers at La Floria four kilometers from the finish after being passed by Croft. After crossing the line in 23:11:15, she was greeted by a large team at the finish to celebrate her second podium finish in three years.

Behind the top three, there were more strong performances. Chinaâ€™sLin Chenfinished fourth in 24:16:33, while Lâ€™Hirondel put it all on the line for a fifth-place finish. The ever-smiling Hawgood, a paragon of consistency who seemingly always finishes in the top 10 of major trail races, was about 22 minutes behind her in sixth with a time of 24:58:19, her third top-10 finish at UTMB and fastest by more than an hour-and-a-half.

That theme of speed was exemplified by the quartet ofSabrina Stanleyof the U.S.,Claudia Trempsof Spain,Martina Valmassoiof Italy, andLucy Bartholomewof Australia, who finished in seventh through 10th, respectively, with a spread of only 23 minutes. And perhaps there are no better illustrations of the depth of the womenâ€™s field than Stanley, who passed Tremps late to improve her time from last yearâ€™s ninth-place finish by roughly 90 minutes, and Bartholomew, who finished in 10th for the second year in a row â€” but with a time 1 hour and 45 minutes faster than last yearâ€™s.

2024 CCC Results: Hawks Wins Again, McCann Victorious in Step Up in Distance,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-ccc-results-hawks-wins-again-mccann-victorious-in-step-up-in-distance,"The 100-kilometerCCCrace left Courmayeur, Italy at 9:00 a.m. local time on Friday, August 30. Official stats put the race at 62.7 miles and with 19,888 feet (over 6,000 meters) of elevation gain. The race goes the opposite direction from the earlier-in-the-weekTDS, connecting the race start in Courmayeur to Champex-Lac, Switzerland and then the finish line hub in Chamonix, France.																					
As withOCCandUTMB Mont Blancfor the 50k and 100-mile distances, CCC too was the UTMB World Series final for the 100k distance, and that meant â‚¬13,000 to each of the winners and prize money going 10 deep. The total CCC prize purse was â‚¬76,000.

Pre-race favoriteToni McCann(South Africa, living in France) led early with onlyMartyna MÅ‚ynarczyk(Poland) in reach. The two were less than a minute apart 16 miles into the race. McCann, the 2023 OCC winner, was expected to be here, but MÅ‚ynarczyk was a surprise this high up. She was sixth at the Tenerife Bluetrail by UTMB 73k earlier this year, but also a standout Ironman triathlete. A chase group led by 2023 fourth-placerHau Ha Thi(Vietnam),Jazmine Lowther(Canada), andHeather Jackson(U.S.) was over seven minutes back.																					
McCannâ€™s lead swelled as she climbed through Italy up to the Grand Col Ferret. She was now nearly four minutes up on MÅ‚ynarczyk and over 10 minutes on everyone else. Lowther fell back to seventh on the climb and would later drop from the race, and Jackson moved up to third.Holly Page(U.K.) entered the top five, 17 minutes behind the race leader.																					
Roughly halfway into the race at mile 34 in Champex-Lac, Switzerland, it was still McCann and, boldly, MÅ‚ynarczyk at the front with a big gap on everyone else. McCann led MÅ‚ynarczyk by almost three minutes, and everyone else was at least 14 minutes behind MÅ‚ynarczyk. Ha Thi was again third, Jackson fourth, andRosanna Buchauer(Germany) had moved into fifth 13 minutes in front of a now sixth-place Page.																					
Ten miles later at mile 44 Trient, Switzerland, McCann and MÅ‚ynarczyk were still out front, but Buchauer had fallen 22 minutes off the lead, while still third alongside Ha Thi.																					
Finally, by mile 51 in Vallorcine, France, McCann fully broke free of MÅ‚ynarczyk. The gap between the first and second runners was now eight minutes, and Buchauer had regained some separation from Ha Thi. Buchauer was six minutes ahead of fourth-place Ha Thi.																					
At the top of the last climb, La FlÃ©gÃ¨re, the positions were set. It was just a four-mile downhill run to Chamonix to go, and McCann, MÅ‚ynarczyk, and Buchauer kept their podium spots in order.																					
McCann won in 11:57 in her debut at the 100k distance. MÅ‚ynarczyk finished a breakout run in second at 12:11. Buchauer was third in 12:16.

Sixteen miles into the race the first 20 men were barely two minutes apart. The group included pre-race favorites likeAdam Peterman(U.S.),Hayden Hawks(U.S.),Manuel Merillas(Spain), andPetter Engdahl(Sweden, living in Norway), among others.																					
A nearly three-mile climb up to the Grand Col Ferret at mile 19 thinned the pack. Hawks gained a 30-second lead over Peterman and Engdahl, and everyone else fell off the lead group by at least two minutes.																					
Seth Ruhling(U.S.), the raceâ€™s 2023 sixth-place finisher, bridged up and ran into the lead alongside Peterman on the next downhill to La Fouly, Switzerland at mile 25. Hawks was just 22 seconds behind at the checkpoint.																					
Ruhling dropped from the race shortly later with an ankle injury, Engdahl too, and Hawks passed Peterman five hours into the race when climbing to Champex-Lac. Behind Hawks and Peterman,Huo-Hua Zhang(China) charged in third two minutes behind, andAndreu Simon(Spain) andDan Jones(New Zealand) were over three minutes back in fourth and fifth.																					
Hawks continued to lead through Trient, Switzerland, seven hours into the day. His training mate Jones briefly moved into second, over three minutes back. Hawks and Jones were third and fourth in June at the Western States 100. Peterman was now third, 50 seconds behind Jones andPeter FraÅˆo(Slovakia), third at the 2023 Trail World Championships Long Trail, was in fourth now less than two minutes behind Peterman.																					
Zhang started to fall back climbing to mile 46. He moved to fifth, while Hawks grew his lead. Hawks led Peterman, Jones, and FraÅˆo by seven, eight, and 10 minutes respectively at that mile 46 timing point.																					
No one could catch Hawks the rest of the way. He won in 10:20. Hawks won CCC back in 2017 too, then in 10:24.																					
FraÅˆo escaped the chase group over the final climb for a second place 10:27, and Peterman was third in 10:28. It was certainly Petermanâ€™s finest result of the year following an injury-filled 2023.

2024 OCC Results: Hemming and Yao Win UTMB 50k World Series Final,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-occ-results-hemming-and-yao-win-utmb-50k-world-series-final,"The 2024OCCrace started at 8:15 a.m. local time on Thursday, August 29. The race links up the towns of OrsiÃ¨res, Switzerland	 Champex-Lac, Switzerland	 and Chamonix, France â€” giving it the abbreviated OCC name. It is often referred to as the Little Swiss Sister ofUTMB. This yearâ€™s course matched the 2022 track and was longer than last year, when a rockslide closed a section of the traditional course.																			
The official stats put the course at 57 kilometers (35 miles) with 3,500 meters (11,500 feet) of elevation gain across three big climbs. The race was the UTMB World Series Final for the 50k distance, and that meant â‚¬13,000 to each of the winners and prize money going 10 deep. The total OCC prize purse was â‚¬76,000.																					
There were some 1,800 runners from 90 different countries in the race. The hot-weather kit requirements were activated for this yearâ€™s race, with temperatures climbing to 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit) range. Runners were required to add sunglasses, a Saharan cap, sunscreen, and extra water capacity to their normally required gear.

Christian Allen(U.S.) opened a near-immediate gap on the field at the start and ran alone for nearly all of the raceâ€™s first half.																					
Eli Hemming(U.S.),Benjamin Roubiol(France),Francesco Puppi(Italy), andRÃ©mi Bonnet(Switzerland) formed a strong initial chase pack that thinned to just Hemming and Bonnet 90 minutes into the race. At Trient, Switzerland, 15 miles and nearly two hours into the race, Allen led Hemming and Bonnet by two minutes.																					
The raceâ€™s second of three big climbs went up Col de Balme, a mountain pass near the Swiss-French border, and here, Hemming dumped Bonnet and ran down Allen. Three hours into the race, Hemming was clear of the rest.																					
Behind Hemming, Bonnet dropped after taking a fall, Allen hit a wall, andAntonio MartÃ­nez(Spain) made a huge move to leap into second on the Col de Balme climb, though still over six minutes behind the leader, however. He also ran a stirring second half at last yearâ€™s race when finishing third.

Puppi found the acceleration up the raceâ€™s third and final climb, returning to the lead group for the first time since early in the race. Puppi overtook MartÃ­nez to move into second and cut into Hemmingâ€™s lead. Hemming ran into trouble on that final climb, briefly stopping near mile 31, but recovered on the downhill finish to maintain his pole position to win in 5:11:48. Puppi was second in 5:14:46, and MartÃ­nez was third in 5:17:56.																					
Hemming became the first American to win OCC, and Puppi and MartÃ­nez were both second and third for the second straight year.

Yaoâ€™s time alone at the front was short-lived though, and Hemming regained the lead on the climb to La GiÃ¨te, Switzerland, two hours into the race.Judith Wyder(Switzerland) also overtook Yao on the climb to move into second. When the course again turned downhill into Trient, Switzerland, Yao again charged. Yao, Wyder, and Hemming exited the Trient aid station, 24.3 kilometers into the race, together with two big climbs to go.																					
Yao broke the group up on the Col de Balme climb, heading up to the course high point at 34 kilometers, and again blasted the downhill right after. She was three two minutes ahead of Wyder at the top, and Hemming would drop from the race further on. Yao led the rest of the race from there, and Wyder stayed in second, too.

The race started at 11 a.m. local time on Saturday, August 10, in the village of Sierre, Switzerland, in the heart of the Valais Alps, and featured around 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) of elevation gain over 31 kilometers (19 miles). The event finishes in the village of Zinal.																					
Sierre-Zinal is an iconic European mountain race and is also known as the â€˜race of five 4,000s,â€™ as the course sits in view of five main Swiss peaks: Weisshorn (4,404 meters), Zinalrothorn (4,221 meters), Obergabelhorn (4,063 meters), Matterhorn (4,478 meters), and Dent Blanche (4,357 meters).																					
Recently, we used data inthis articleto dive deep into the history and competition of Sierre-Zinal.																					
The race was simultaneously part of the World Mountain Running Association (WMRA) World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series.																					
It was a hot start to the day, with temperatures reaching 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) at the start line. There were clear blue skies throughout and dry conditions, with temperatures only getting warmer throughout the race.																					
There was a shock win for Kenyan athlete Joyline Chepngeno, who had a huge lead throughout, despite it being her first ever trail race. Whilst Kilian Jornet won the race for the 10th time, he was pushed to his limits byPhilemon Ombogo Kiriago(Kenya), last yearâ€™s champion who attacked near the close of the race. Read on for the full race story.																					
This yearâ€™s Sierre-Zinalâ€™s biggest story surrounded the womenâ€™s winnerJoyline Chepngenoof Kenya, a true underdog in the race. This was Chepngenoâ€™s first ever trail race. After the birth of her two children, Chepngeno lost 30 kilograms and decided to run again, and this was her spectacular debut to the world of trail running.																					
Not only did Chepngeno win one of the most competitive trail races in the world, but she won by a huge margin. Right from the beginning, she took pole position in the womenâ€™s race, and extended her lead throughout.

There was some speculation as to whether Chepngeno was going to be able to maintain the lead, potentially going too hard at the start and unable to fend off more experienced athletes. However, she buried any of the doubts and dominated the womenâ€™s race to the end, finishing more than eight minutes clear of her closest competitor.																					
Whilst Chepngeno took the lead, another ascendant athlete took second place.Scout Adkin(U.K.) was taking part in her longest trail race to date, however sheâ€™s been quickly rising through the WMRA World Cup ranks this summer, with prior top performances. She passed through the checkpoint at Ponchette (7.5 kilometers) in 59:29, one minute ahead of one of the race favorites,Joyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya).

Running with Muthoni Njeru wasMonica MÄƒdÄƒlina Florea(Romania), who recently took second at the 2024 Marathon du Mont Blanc.																					
As the runners entered the next checkpoint at Chandolin, Muthoni Njeru overtook Adkin for second place, but this lead was seemingly short lived. On the descent to Tignousa at 16k, it looked as though Muthoni Njeru had overcooked it, and Adkin made a strong attack, retaining her second-place position.																					
Adkin passed the checkpoint 29 seconds ahead of Muthoni Njeru. Florea continued to maintain her position in fourth a minute back, whilstPhilaries Jeruto Kisang(Kenya) came through in fifth a couple of minutes later.																					
Unfortunately for Muthoni Njeru, she continued to fade, and this worked to Floreaâ€™s advantage. She overtook to take over third place around the 20k mark, now less than two minutes behind Adkin in second. As a powerful downhill runner, this was a chance for Florea to make up ground, but Adkin maintained her position all the way to the finish line.																					
Joyline Chepngeno crossed the finish line in 2:54:06, taking a huge win. She was followed by Scout Adkin, who finished in 3:02:21, and Monica MÄƒdÄƒlina Florea in third in 3:04:29. Philaries Jeruto Kisang moved up to fourth and finished in 3:05:52, andCristina Simion(Romania) finished fifth in 3:07:51.																					
Joyce Muthoni Njeru dropped out of the top 10 and finished in 12th in 3:13:30.

It was a bold but expected start to the race from favoriteKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway), who already had nine wins to his name on the revered route. He started at the front of the race and looked to have a significant gap on the rest of the field.

However, at the Ponchette checkpoint, 7.5k in,Josphat Kiprotich(Kenya) had closed the gap and came through hot on Jornetâ€™s heels. Switzerlandâ€™sRÃ©mi Bonnet, the 2022 and 2023 Golden Trail World Series overall winner, came through next, followed byPatrick KipngenoandPaul Machokaof Kenya.																					
The first twist of the menâ€™s race came shortly thereafter, when Kiprotich overtook Jornet. This is where the first battle at the front of the menâ€™s race commenced and it was a cat-and-mouse chase between the two athletes, with Kiprotich running within 15 seconds of course record pace at the 12k mark.																					
By halfway, Kiprotich still had a modest lead, coming through the checkpoint in 1:23:15, followed by Jornet in 1:24:01.																					
Whilst the battle ensued for first, Kipngeno and Bonnet worked together to hold onto third and fourth positions, as they passed through the 16k mark together in 1:25:26.Philemon Ombogo Kiriago(Kenya), the 2023 Sierre-Zinal champion, had by now managed to overtake Machoka to move into fifth place.

After the 20k mark, where most of the climbing had been completed, the race really became unpredictable. Jornet caught up with Kiprotich and they passed the 20k checkpoint in 1:43:17, but this is where Jornet made his attack. He created a 30-second lead on second place, and rolled along the trails whilst others battled it out behind.																					
Although Kipngeno and Bonnet hit Hotel Weisshorn at the same time (1:45:03), it was Kipngeno who went for the attack and overtook Kiprotich for second place. But that wasnâ€™t the end. Kipngenoâ€™s training partner Ombogo Kiriago steamed ahead, and with a polite tap on the back, powered past Kipngeno and had his sights set on Jornet.																					
On the technical descent toward the finish line, it looked like Jornet had a comfortable lead when Ombogo Kiriago came out of nowhere to overtake the nine-time winner and even gained on him.																					
This was by far the biggest shock of the race, and it wasnâ€™t long before Jornet drove down the descent hard to reclaim first position, but he had to work for it all the way to the finish line. Ombogo Kiriago was chasing hard, and the sprint finish through the streets of Zinal led Kilian Jornet to win and also take a new course record, finishing in 2:25:34, beating his previous 2019 course record by a single second.																					
Philemon Ombogo Kiriago finished just behind in 2:25:36 and the two athletes collapsed as they crossed the line. Patrick Kipngeno held third position and crossed the line in 2:26:59, followed by Josphat Kiprotich in 2:31:35 in fourth, andRoberto Delorenzi(Switzerland) in 2:32:26 for fifth place.																					
Paul Mochoka ultimately took sixth in 2:32:35, and RÃ©mi Bonnet faded during the latter end of the race and dropped back to ninth position, crossing in 2:33:57.

2024 Speedgoat by UTMB 50k Results: Sinclair Sets Record, Lowther Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-speedgoat-by-utmb-50k-results,"The 2024Speedgoat by UTMB 50kkicked off at 6:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, July 20, high in Utahâ€™s Wasatch Mountains at the famous Snowbird ski resort. Once all 32 miles (52 kilometers) and 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) of climbing were complete,David Sinclairhad a new course record, while Canadaâ€™sJazmine Lowtherled the womenâ€™s race from wire to wire.																					
The weather was truly typical for a high-altitude summer day: fresh crispness in the morning, eventually yielding to a full sun whose heat always feels stronger at altitude.																					
Sinclairâ€™s no-contest treatment of both the course and the menâ€™s field showed that he was far-and-away the best menâ€™s runner of the day.Samuel Hendryâ€™s(Canada) performance for second place, while holding that position for basically the whole race, was also dominant.																					
And for Lowther, though the womenâ€™s race ran more closely, she, too, showed strength to stay ahead of a big chasing field, including significant pressure from second place byMali Noyes, who made her presence known in the second half of the race.																					
Read on for more of this yearâ€™s Speedgoat 50k story.

It was a tight start to the menâ€™s race, but that didnâ€™t last long. Through the first checkpoint at mile four, a group of eight men rolled through within a minute of each other. Then, at about mile nine and the top of the first major climb, the summit of 11,000-plus-foot Hidden Peak, two men,David SinclairandSamuel Hendry(Canada), who would ultimately go one-two at the finish, passed through together, with more than two minutes on the rest of the field.																					
Sinclair is familiar with this race, having finished it three times and won it twice before, as recently as 2022. Hendry, an elite cross-country skier and skilled shorter-distance trail runner, looked to be moving up in distance with this race.																					
Behind them at mile nine, the top-10 men had strung out to within seven minutes of the lead. Among that group and pushing the pace wasAdam Peterman, a prior Speedgoat 50k champion and the then course record holder, andScott Patterson, a two-time Olympian in cross-country skiing and a mountain runner.																					
From here on, though, it was the Sinclair show, as at each checkpoint, his gap on Hendry â€” as well as the rest of the field â€” increased. By mile 20 at the Mineral Basin checkpoint, on the backside of Snowbird ski resort, Sinclairâ€™s lead was just shy of nine minutes, and it only extended from there.																					
For the raceâ€™s final third, it was only the clock that Sinclair raced. When he crossed the line, after summiting Hidden Peak a second time, racking up a boatload of vertical, and taking the fast-and-furious descent back to the base of the ski resort, David Sinclair won in 4:57:35. This broke the previous course record of 5:04:31 set by Peterman in 2021. Sinclair also shaved over 11 minutes off his previous time when he won the race in 2022.

Onto the rest of the menâ€™s race. For as dominant as Sinclair was in first place, so was Hendry in second. By mile 20, Hendry had built a four-minute lead over the rest of the field, which he would hold at each aid station until the finish. Samuel Hendry ultimately crossed the finish line comfortably in second place in 5:24:57, with more than seven minutes on the next chasing man.																					
At every single aid station, it was Patterson holding a strong third place. So when the Olympian Scott Patterson crossed the line in third with a time of 5:32:26, it should not have come as surprise ending.																					
David Hedgestook fourth in 5:38:35 andGrant Barnettefifth in 5:45:56.

Full results.																					
While the womenâ€™s race for the win ran much more closely than in the menâ€™s, Canadaâ€™sJazmine Lowthertook the lead from the get-go, never gave in as women ran closely behind her, and put the hammer down to crush the final descent â€” and the rest of the womenâ€™s field. Lowther was coming to this race after recovering from a longer-term injury that followed a pretty incredible couple years of ultrarunning, which saw her win the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k and take second at the 2023 Transgrancanaria.																					
To look at Lowtherâ€™s lead over her closest chaser, as the race progressed, it bounced from about a minute at the first checkpoint at mile four and over Hidden Peak for the first time at mile nine, before growing to more than 3.5 minutes by mile 20. She gave back some of that time in the next five rough and verty miles, holding just an 80-second lead when she summited Hidden Peak for the second time at mile 25 and began the big descent to the finish.																					
Over those final seven-ish miles, Lowther put six minutes on second place. That cracking descent from Jazmine Lowther ensured her victory and she crossed the finish line in 6:15:05.

The race for the rest of the womenâ€™s top five was highly dynamic, with women moving around for much of the race. The closest chasers at the first checkpoint at mile four wereEmkay SullivanandMartina Valmassoi(Italy), the former of whom would remain dominant all race and the latter of whom would need to drop due to physical issues.																					
After over 6,000 feet of climb since the start of the race, over the first summit of Hidden Peak at mile nine,Emily Caldwellalso made her presence known, passing over Hidden Peak in second place, with Sullivan right there in third.																					
Over the next 11 miles, another runner presented herself a challenger,Mali Noyes, a prior two-time finisher who took second last year. The cross-country and downhill skier at least partially converted to trail running a few years ago, and has been racking up experience in American trail races. Noyes moved into second place for the women before mile 18 and then held it to the finish. Mali Noyesâ€™s impressive climb up the leaderboard in the first half, before holding steady in the raceâ€™s second half, led her to finish in second place in 6:22:31.																					
Much like Noyes in second place moved into that position before mile 18, so did ultimate womenâ€™s third-place finisherKodi Kleven. Kleven is a local runner, coach, and former collegiate runner who finished seventh at the 2022 Speedgoat 50k, so she was looking to move up this year.																					
And also like Noyes, Klevenâ€™s gap on the rest of the field stayed fairly close and fluctuated. For Kleven, her breakaway from the rest of the field took place on the beefy climb back up to Hidden Peak for a second time at mile 25. There, Kleven had carved out a fairly comfortable seven-minute lead, which she extended to 11 minutes by the finish line. Kodi Kleven crossed the finish line in 6:24:12 for third place.																					
Emkay Sullivan ultimately finished fourth in 6:35:09.Lindsay Allisonalso moved up during the latter half of the race, finishing in fifth in 6:41:39.

2024 Hardrock 100 Results: Pommeret and Dauwalter Break Course Records and Claim Commanding Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-hardrock-100-results,"																					
It was,Ludovic Pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said, a dream when he kissed the rock at the end of the 2024Hardrock 100. He finished his lap around the San Juan Mountains of Colorado with a new overall course record of 21:33:06, breakingKilian Jornetâ€™sprevious record, set in 2022, by just over three minutes. Pommeret, a 48-year-old Frenchman, led almost wire-to-wire in a commanding fashion.																					
â€œI dream all the day,â€ Pommeret said at the iconic rock-kissing finish just past 3:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, July 13, 2024. â€œThe nightmare never came.â€																					
Neither did it come for the womenâ€™s winnerCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who seems to redefine what is possible in ultrarunning every time she toes the line. Dauwalter won the womenâ€™s race in 26:11:49, setting a new overall womenâ€™s course record, breaking her own mark of 26:14:12set last yearas the second race ofher historic Western States 100-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple. That means Dauwalter, who also led essentially wire-to-wire, has set a course record the past three times sheâ€™s run and owns the fastest three womenâ€™s times.

But before the two champions got back to the rock, there was a lot of running to do. At 6 a.m. local time on Friday, July 12, 146 runners set off in the predawn darkness under the watchful gaze of the San Juan Mountains in Silverton, Colorado, to begin one of the most famous, arduous, andscenically stunning100-mile races in the world.																					
The Hardrock 100, famous for itsdifficultyandselectiveness, is a 102.5-mile trek featuring more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain and an average elevation of 11,000 feet through the rugged San Juans. It alternates directions every year, and this yearâ€™s race went clockwise. Starting in the smallminingtown of Silverton, runners made their way to Telluride before continuing on to Ouray and near Lake City and then returned to Silverton to kiss the iconic rock. The course, often impacted by snow, was mostly snow-free this year, and temperatures vacillated between sub-40 degrees and 80 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day and night.																					
â€œItâ€™s 100 miles. Itâ€™s huge mountains. Itâ€™s altitude,â€ Dauwalter said in her pre-race interview with iRunFar. â€œSo, adventure is guaranteed for sure.â€																					
Read on for more details about that adventure.																					
Thank you so much toTailwindfor sponsoring iRunFarâ€™s coverage of the 2024 Hardrock 100!																					
Thanks also toFractelfor sponsoring our race coverage.																					
Entering the race, it was fair to wonder what droveCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)Â to return to the event again. Over the past two years, sheâ€™d won twice and set course records in both directions. But she was back, she said during her pre-race interview with iRunFar, because she still felt that she had left something on the course.																					
â€œI am back because all of my runs here have had just really significant chunks of time that were spent in very low places,â€ she said. â€œI would love to try to smooth out those lows just a little bit, and see if I can get around that course without having so many huge hours.â€ And while she struggled with stomach issues for some of the second half of the run, she still reset the overall course record, breaking her previous clockwise record by more than 30 minutes.																					
Dauwalter, whowon the Transgrancanaria 126kand the Mt. Fuji 100 Mile already this year, is so consistently dominant that her wins in major ultras can seem like a foregone conclusion. But Hardrock is never easy, and she still had to cover the 100-plus miles and 33,000-plus feet of elevation gain. Once again, she did it faster than any woman ever had before her, including herself.

Franceâ€™sCamille Bruyas(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Germanyâ€™sKatharina Hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) posed the biggest challenges to Dauwalter. Both had finished second by Dauwalter at UTMB in 2021 and 2023, respectively, and both had spent the last few weeks in the U.S. acclimating to the high elevations and learning the terrain. While Dauwalter had opened a small gap on Bruyas at the Kamm Traverse aid station (mile 11) and maintained it through Chapman at mile 18, by Telluride at mile 28, Bruyas had closed the gap and came through in the co-lead with Dauwalter, two minutes under course record pace.																					
Dauwalter slowly began to pull away â€” five minutes up at Krogerâ€™s Canteen at mile 33 and six minutes by Ouray at mile 44 â€” before making a strong move to increase her lead over Bruyas to 31 minutes by mile 52. At that point, just over halfway, it was Dauwalter, followed by Bruyas, Hartmuth,Tara Dower(pre-race interview), and Franceâ€™sClaire Bannwarthrounding out the top five.

From there, Dauwalter continued to run alone. Smiling and moving swiftly in a bright yellow shirt, she was 18 minutes under course-record pace by Animas Forks aid station at mile 58, making quick work of the aid station and picking up her pacer.																					
One of the few signs of fatigue she showed all race was at the Sherman aid station at mile 73, after climbing and descending from Handies Peak, the courseâ€™s high point at 14,058 feet. She stayed for five minutes to rest and refuel before running on into the dark. By Maggie Gulch at mile 87, she was nearly an hour under course-record pace and looked strong. Six miles later, at Cunningham Gulch, she picked up her husband as her pacer as they made their way up and over the final climb.																					
Less than three hours later and now in the early-morning sun, Dauwalter returned to the rock, and kissed it once more.																					
Behind her, Hartmuth, who was nursing a bruised sacrum from a fall three weeks prior, had closed the gap on Bruyas during the mid-race miles to as little as 13 minutes by Sherman at mile 73. Eye issues slowed Hartmuth later in the race, causing blurry vision and slow movement, and Bruyas doubled her lead by Pole Creek at mile 81. Bruyas took an 18-minute stop at the Maggie Gulch aid station at mile 87 to refuel and get warm, while Hartmuth, who was also feeling the miles, also took an extended break.

Camille Bruyas battled through the rest of the race to finish second in 29:28:11, and Hartmuth, after a long stop at Cunningham Gulch (mile 93) to get warm under a blanket and deal with her deteriorating vision, finished third in 30:29:12.																					
The race for the top five behind them was perhaps the closest of the day. After saying she had thrown up eight times, Dower, just three years into her ultrarunning career, battled to catch up to Bannwarth by Maggie Gulch at mile 87. Bannwarth, who was visibly struggling, fell off the pace, while Dower flew along in pursuit of a spot in the top five.

By Cunningham Gulch at mile 93, the three women in contention for positions three through five â€”Yitka Winn,Emily Halnon, and Dower â€” were separated by only 16 minutes. All three made short stops at the aid station before continuing.																					
Between Cunningham Gulch and the final descent at mile 97, Halnon made a move. She passed Winn to move into fourth place, making up more than 20 minutes in less than six miles. Dower, meanwhile, put in a huge move of her own on the rocky final descent and also passed Winn, with the gap growing visibly in a very short distance.																					
Therein, perhaps, lies the beauty of Hardrock and ultras in general: After almost 100 miles of racing, the battle for the top five came down to two moves made on the final descent and the final rolling miles into the streets of Silverton. In the end, Tara Dower held onto fourth in 33:10:55, Yitka Winn finished fifth in 33:17:00, and Emily Halnon came in looking absolutely ecstatic in sixth with a time of 33:24:22.

The first significant news in the menâ€™s field came a week before the race began. AmericanZach Miller, who wassecond in last yearâ€™s UTMBand had put ina monster training blockin preparation for Hardrock, was among the favorites, but did not race following an emergency appendectomy on July 5. Ever the optimist and making the most of a disappointing situation, Miller spent part of Saturday morningmaking his patented donuts for fans.																					
Along with Miller, Franceâ€™sFranÃ§ois Dâ€™Haene(pre-race interview) was expected to contend for the win, even if he had been coming back from injury and not feeling 100% leading up to race day due to an illness a few weeks ahead of time. Dâ€™Haene, one of the best runners in the world at long mountainous ultras, set the counter-clockwise course record for the win in 2021 before placing second behindKilian Jornetin 2022 in the clockwise direction. Entering the race, Dâ€™Haene had two of the fastest three times in race history.

And whileLudovic Pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was certainly expected to be among the top contenders this year, itâ€™s probably fair to say he was not the favorite. But once the race began, the Frenchman made his intentions clear.																					
Pommeret, who was running his first full Hardrock after pacing for last yearâ€™s winnerAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallaz, arrived in Silverton on June 14 and completed two laps of the course as multi-day trips, otherwise known as Softrocks, as part of a month-long training block to acclimatize to the altitude and mountains. That fitness and preparation were clear from the moment the race began when Pommeret led a pack of runners, including Dâ€™Haene,Jason Schlarb(post-race interview), and Switzerlandâ€™sDiego Pazos(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) through the Rainbow Trail at mile 1.5.

At Kamm Traverse (mile 11), Pommeret, Dâ€™Haene, and Pazos all came through in the lead together. By mile 28, when Pommeret entered Telluride in 5:34 elapsed, he was two minutes below course-record pace, with Dâ€™Haene 2.5 minutes behind him.																					
Then began the famous 4,300-foot ascent to Krogerâ€™s Canteen aid station, which sits at 13,100 feet above sea level at mile 33. Pommeret came through in the lead again, smiling and drinking Coke before leaving after only a minute. Dâ€™Haene was still close behind, and Schlarb â€” whotied Jornet for the win at Hardrockin 2016 and has been recovering from a torn ACL from a skiing accident two years ago â€” came through in third, 32 minutes off the lead. â€œItâ€™s hard to feel good up here,â€ Schlarb said, drinking only water and leaving quickly. Pazos, who has several strong finishes at UTMB, came across the iconic pass four minutes behind Schlarb.

It was on the descent to Ouray that Pommeret began to open up a gap. By Ouray (mile 44), the gap to Dâ€™Haene, who began to show signs of fatigue on a hot, humid section of the course, was 23 minutes. It was a stark contrast to Pommeret, who looked as smooth as ever. At just over the halfway mark (mile 52), the top four men were Pommeret, Dâ€™Haene at 62 minutes off the lead, Schlarb just two minutes behind him, and Pazos a further 11 minutes back.																					
By Animas Forks at mile 58, Pommeret had increased his lead to 1 hour and 24 minutes, and Schlarb, despite puking, and Pazos had passed Dâ€™Haene, who was sadly in tears at the aid station. Dâ€™Haene dropped from the race soon after, saying, â€œYou donâ€™t know if you donâ€™t play.â€ He was clearly still feeling the after-effects of an illness just 10 days prior.																					
Pommeret continued cruising. He looked smooth and efficient at the next several aid stations, refueling quickly before continuing his record day. At the Sherman aid station at mile 73, now 22 minutes ahead of course-record pace, Pommeret was animated and sprinted away after a three-minute stop, less than 20 miles from history.																					
Almost exactly seven hours later â€” after three more characteristically short stops at the remaining aid stations â€” Pommeret made history, running the final few steps in the cold dark before hugging the rock that had awaited him for the past 21-plus hours. He was officially a Hardrock champion and course-record holder.																					
Pommeretâ€™s win is a testament to his longevity: He ran his first UTMB 20 years ago,won it in 2016, and now, eight years later, has won Hardrock. Both Dâ€™Haene and Miller were at the finish line to congratulate the new champion.																					
After Dâ€™Haene dropped, the battle for second was between Schlarb and Pazos. Schlarb was in front by 13 minutes at mile 62.5, but Pazos looked determined to reel him in. By Sherman at mile 73, Schlarb reported that he had been cramping for most of the race, while Pazos, who quietly devoured a cup of noodles, had cut into his lead.

Fourteen miles later at Maggie Gulch (mile 87), Pazos still looked strong and had passed Schlarb, who said he was battling nausea and getting in his nutrition. Pazos had turned a nine-minute deficit into a six-minute lead. That order would remain until the finish, with Diego Pazos taking second in 24:39:33 and Jason Schlarb coming in third in 24:48:13.																					
Jeff Rome, thesecond-place finisher in 2018who lives just blocks away from the start of the race and was quoting J.R.R. Tolkien at aid stations, ran an extremely consistent second half of the race to claim fourth, whileBrian Petersontook fifth after emerging from a crowded back half of the menâ€™s top 10 over the last 25 miles. His time was 29:36:04.

2024 Western States 100 Results: Walmsley Wins a Fourth Time While Schide Rocks the Womenâ€™s Field,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-western-states-100-results,"For hours,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) chased ghosts. For hours,Jim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andRodFarvard(post-race interview) chased each other. And in the end, after 100 courageous, gutsy miles at one of the worldâ€™s most iconic ultramarathons, it was Schide and Walmsley who won a fast, dramatic 2024Western States 100.																					
Schide, an American who lives in France, was on pace to break the course record until late in the race, while Americans Walmsley and Farvard battled throughout most of the second half of the race, alternating the lead as late as mile 85.																					
Schideâ€™s winning time was 15:46:57, just over 17 minutes behindCourtney Dauwalterâ€™s2023 course record, almost an hour faster than her own time last year, and the second fastest womenâ€™s time ever. Walmsley, meanwhile, won his fourth Western States in 14:13:45, the second fastest time ever â€” only behind his own record of 14:09:28 that heset in 2019.																					
Second and third in the menâ€™s race came down to an epic sprint finish on the track between Farvard andHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who finished in 14:24:15 and 14:24:31, respectively.																					
In the womenâ€™s race for the podium,Fu-Zhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished second in 16:20:03, andEszter Csillag(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took third for the second time in a row, in 16:42:17.																					
Both races featured one of the deepest and most competitive fields in race history, with the menâ€™s top five all coming in faster than last yearâ€™s winning time, and the womenâ€™s top 10 finishing just under 40 minutes faster than last yearâ€™s incredibly competitive top 10.																					
At 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 29, they were all among the 375 runners who began the historic route from Olympic Valley to Auburn, California, traversing 100.2 miles of trail with 18,000 feet of elevation gain and 22,000 feet of loss. After last yearâ€™s cool temperatures, the weather at this yearâ€™s race was a bit warmer, albeit with a notable lack of snow in the high country. The high temperature in Auburn was in the low 90s Fahrenheit.

In his return to the race that propelled him to the heights of global trail running and his first ultra on American soil in three years,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) demonstrated why he is, once again, the king of Western States. Before the race, Walmsley exuded a calmness that perhaps eluded him during his first attempts, when he attacked it with an obsessive intensity that led him to famously take a wrong turn and then dropping out in back-to-back years.																					
â€œWeâ€™ll just roll with what plays out and just kind of see what happens in the race,â€ he said in hispre-race interview. Thereâ€™s a marked difference when compared to his remarks from hisinterviewbefore the 2016 race.																					
What happened in the race was this: In his fourth Western States,Rod Farvard(post-race interview) had the race of his life to push Walmsley like heâ€™d never been pushed before in his long history with the event.																					
Farvard â€” a 28-year-old from Mammoth Lakes, California, who has improved his finish each year at the race, from a DNF in 2021 to 41st place in 2022 to 11th place last year â€” put himself in a strong position from the start, leading a large pack of runners that included Walmsley at the top of the Escarpment, the 2,500-foot climb in the first four miles of the race. For the next 45-plus miles, Farvard remained in the top 10, part of a chase pack of AmericanHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), KiwiDan Jones(pre-race interview), and Chinese runnerGuo-Min Deng, among others.

At the Robinson Flat aid station at mile 30 â€” the symbolic end of the runnersâ€™ time in the high country, which features an average elevation of around 7,000 feet â€” Walmsley, who started the race conspicuously wearing all black, came through in 4:24 looking fast and smooth, now wearing an ice-soaked white shirt. Jones,the 2024 Tarawera 102k championand fifth-place finisher in his Western States debut last year, and Hawks,who set the course record at Februaryâ€™s Black Canyons 100kafter dropping out of last yearâ€™s Western States, followed about 90 seconds later. The two runners, frequent training partners, ran together frequently throughout the day, with Hawks often foregoing ice at aid stations.																					
After the trio of Walmsley, Hawks, and Jones went through Last Chance at mile 43 together, Walmsley put nearly two minutes on them up the climb to Devilâ€™s Thumb. â€œI was with everybody at the bottom,â€ he said, according to the raceâ€™s official livestream.																					
About halfway through, at mile 49.5, the order remained the same: Walmsley in the lead with an elapsed time of 6:58, followed by Jones one minute back, Hawks two minutes back, and Farvard just over two and a half minutes back. The rest of the top 10 were last yearâ€™s 17th-place finisherDakota Jones	2024 Transvulcania UltramarathonchampionJon Albon(pre-race interview), who is from the U.K. but lives in Norway	 2023 fourth-place finisherJia-Sheng Shen(China) (pre-race interview)	2023 Canyons 100kchampionCole Watson	 Western States specialistTyler Green(pre-race interview)	 andJupiter Carera(Mexico).

Then began a thrilling, chaotic second half of the race â€” featuring a gripping back-and-forth between Walmsley and Farvard, a wildfire near the course, a two-man river crossing, and a sprint finish on the track.																					
It all started when Walmsley entered Michigan Bluff at mile 55, again looking calm and in control, changing shirts and getting doused with ice. Farvard came in just behind him and left the aid station first, leading the race for the first time since the first climb up the Escarpment. The same routine took place seven miles later at Foresthill: Walmsley entering first, Farvard leaving first.

For the next 18 miles, the two runners alternated in the lead. By mile 78, they were so close that they were crossing the American River at the same time. Their battle underscored the overall depth of the field at this yearâ€™s race: At mile 80, the top five men were within 16 minutes of one another.

Around then, the 15-acre Creek Fire, which started not long before, was visible from the final quarter of the course and crews were temporarily not permitted to travel to the Green Gate aid station at mile 80 because the route to it passed close to the fire. Eventually, a reroute was established for crews to get to Green Gate and, later, after the wildfire was controlled, the regular route was reopened.																					
At Green Gate, Farvard came through in the lead, with Walmsley four minutes back and looking like he was hurting. It was then, perhaps, that the thought entered peopleâ€™s minds: Could Farvard really take down the champ?																					
But Jim Walmsley is Jim Walmsley for a reason, and he again proved why he is among the worldâ€™s best. Against the ropes, facing one of his first real challenges in the race that shaped him, he delivered, entering the next aid station, Auburn Lake Trails at mile 85, more than a minute earlier than Farvard. He had made up five minutes in five miles.																					
Walmsley never trailed again, increasing his lead to 11 minutes by the Pointed Rocks aid station at mile 94 and then picking up his crew, including his wife,Jess Brazeau, at Robie Point to run the final mile with him. He entered the track at Placer High School to loud cheers, his loping stride still looking smooth, stopping a few steps short of the tape to wave to the crowd and raise his arms in triumph. He had done it again.

Behind him, Farvard was fading but determined to cap an extraordinary race with a second-place finish. Hawks, who had made up five minutes on Farvard in the couple miles between Pointed Rocks and Robie Point, was on the hunt, and by the time he stepped on the track, Farvard was within sight.																					
It was then that fans were treated to one of the most unique sights in all of ultrarunning: After 100 miles of racing, two men were sprinting against each other on a track. In the end, Farvardâ€™s lead held, and he finished 16 seconds ahead of Hawks. He collapsed at the finish line â€” a fitting end to an epic performance.																					
Dan Jones ended a strong race with a fourth-place finish in 14:32:29, withCaleb Olsoncapping an impressive second half of the race â€” from 11th at mile 53 to fifth in 14:40:12 at the finish. All five men ran a time that would have won the race last year.

Behind Olson came Jon Albon, running 14:57:01 in his 100-mile running-race debut, followed by the surgical Tyler Green, who finished in seventh for his fourth straight top 10 finish at the race. Greenâ€™s time of 15:05:39 also marked a new menâ€™s masters course record, breaking the 2013Mike Mortonrecord of 15:45:21.																					
Rounding out the top 10 were Jia-Sheng Shen in eighth with a time of 15:09:49,Jonathan Reain ninth who methodically moved his way up during the last 60 miles to finish in 15:13:10	 andChris Myersin 10th in 15:18:25.

Through the high country, into and out of the canyons, and along the river of the worldâ€™s oldest 100-mile trail race,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) raced only the ghosts of the clock and history. Smiling throughout, she seemed unaffected by the solitude and the enormity of the possibility that lay before her: to attempt to break the course record of one of the worldâ€™s most iconic trail races.																					
Schide, an American who lives in France, came into the race as the clear favorite, and for good reason: She finished second last year, breakingEllie Greenwoodâ€™spreviously untouchable 2012 course record by more than three minutes and losing to onlyCourtney Dauwalter, who broke Greenwoodâ€™s record by an astounding 78 minutes on her way to a historic Western States-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple win. Schide, winner of the 2022 UTMB and 2023 Diagonale des Fous 100 Mile, spent the last two-and-a-half months in Flagstaff, Arizona, training for Western States, winning this yearâ€™s Canyons 100k in an impressive tune-up and putting ina monster training block.																					
In her pre-race interview, Schide said that she had thought about ways to improve her race from last year, which perhaps should have been the first warning to her competition. The second, then, was her immediate separation from the womenâ€™s chase pack: She summited the Escarpment, a 2,500-foot climb during the first four miles, in first place and never looked back. By the first aid station â€” Lyon Ridge at 10 miles â€” she was already 12 minutes under course record pace, and by Robinson Flat at mile 30, she was 21 minutes ahead of second-placeEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview), from Zimbabwe but living in the U.S.

The lead only ballooned from there. By Dusty Corners at mile 38, Schide was an incredible 26 minutes under course record pace, and though she lost a few minutes from that pace by the time she climbed up to Michigan Bluff at mile 55, her smile had not waned even slightly. She smoothly entered the iconic aid station, doused herself with ice, changed shirts, and was soon on her way. She never sat down.																					
Twenty-seven minutes behind her was Hawgood, looking to build on back-to-back fifth-place finishes.Eszter Csillag(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), a Hungarian who lives in Hong Kong, followed soon after, in the same third spot she finished in last year.

After them ran a dense pack of women: Only 16 minutes separated Hawgood in second fromLotti Brinksin 11th.

At the halfway point, the top 10 were Schide, 33 minutes up in an elapsed time of 7:26	 Csillag	 Hawgood	 Chinese runnerFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the fourth-place finisher at last yearâ€™s UTMB	Lin Chen(China)	 AmericanHeather Jackson, a versatile former triathlete who recently finished fifth at a competitive 200-mile gravel bike race	 ultrarunning veteranIda Nilsson(pre-race interview), a Swede living in Norway	Becca Windell, second in this yearâ€™s Black Canyon 100k	2023 CCCwinnerYngvild Kaspersen(Norway)	 andRachel Drake, running her 100-mile debut.												
Schide, easily identifiable in her pink shirt, maintained her large lead throughout the second half of the race, remaining calm, controlled, and upbeat throughout the tough canyon miles. By Foresthill at mile 62, she was 19 minutes ahead of course record pace and 48 minutes ahead of the second-place Xiang. Schideâ€™s stride still looked smooth as she waved to fans and even high-fived a cameraman.																					
Schideâ€™s aggressive pace eventually slowed â€” by Green Gate at mile 80, her lead on the course record had dissipated â€” but her spirits did not. After a quick sponge bath at Auburn Lake Trails aid station at mile 85, she fell behind course-record pace for the first time all day, only 15 miles remained until the finish.																					
Schide entered the track a couple of hours later, running with her crew and no headlamp. She would finish before dark. She stopped for a hug on the final straightaway and lifted the tape with, of course, a smile.

Xiang had methodically pulled away from Hawgood and Csillag during an incredibly strong second half to win the battle for second. Fu-Zhao Xiang finished in 16:20:03 for the third fastest time in race history. Chen, who dropped out at mile 78, was one of the few elite runners who had a DNF on this day, which was categorized by a lack of attrition in both the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s elite races.																					
Eszter Csillag came in about 22 minutes behind Xiang in 16:42:17 for her second consecutive third-place finish, a 30-minute improvement from last year â€” a statistic that perhaps exemplifies the speed of this yearâ€™s race better than any other.

The battle for fourth and fifth was nearly as close as Farvard and Hawksâ€™s race for second in the menâ€™s race a couple of hours earlier.																					
At Pointed Rocks at mile 94, Hawgood led by barely two minutes, running hard and straight through the aid station. Kaspersen, meanwhile, was drinking Coke and made up almost a minute by Robie Point.																					
Western States rookie Yngvild Kaspersen ran a smart race en route to placing fifth. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell																					
Emily Hawgoodâ€™s lead ultimately held, and she finished fourth in 16:48:43 to improve her finish from prior years by one spot. Yngvild Kaspersen was less than two minutes back in 16:50:39. Ida Nilsson capped a strong day to finish sixth in 16:56:52 and breakRagna Debatsâ€™smasters course record by almost 45 minutes. That means the top six women all finished in under 17 hours in a race that had only ever had three women finish under that mark â€” and two of them, Dauwalter and Schide, were last year.																					
The rest of the top 10 were Heather Jackson in seventh in 17:16:43, and, in close succession, Rachel Drake in 17:28:35,Priscilla Forgie(Canada) in 17:30:24, andLeah Yinglingin 17:33:54.

2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k Results: Njeru and Kipngeno Lead From Start To Finish,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-broken-arrow-skyrace-23k-results,"With start-to-finish dominance, Kenyan athletesJoyce Muthoni NjeruandPatrick Kipngenotook first place at the 2024Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k.																					
The 2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k took place on Sunday, June 23, and was part of the weekend of the Broken Arrow Skyrace festival, including a Vertical Kilometer, 11k, 18k, the Ironface Challenge, and 46k races. After last yearâ€™s route was cut short due to poor weather conditions, this year, there was much less snow and a cloudless, warm morning â€” the stage was set for an exciting race.

The race is 21.75 kilometers (13.5 miles) long and has 1,433 meters (4,700 feet) of vertical gain. It takes place in the Palisades Tahoe ski area, where the legendary Western States 100 begins next Saturday, and routes itself on the resortâ€™s more technical paths.																					
This race was the season opener for the 2024World Mountain Running Association World Cup, as was the Vertical Kilometer race, which took place two days prior.																					
Last yearâ€™s winners of the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s races,Allie McLaughlinandEli Hemming, took part in this yearâ€™s event, so the pressure may have been on them to retain their titles. In the end, the Kenyan athletes reigned supreme. Plus, the drama and close racing continued to the finish lines, especially in the womenâ€™s race.																					
Read on for the full story.																					
The first three miles of the race are the fastest and most runnable part of the course, making it a quick start.Joyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya) was first to the Snow King checkpoint at 4.6 miles in 40:23. She held a just-under-two-minute lead onTabor Hemming, who passed the checkpoint in 42:03. Less than one minute behind second place was last yearâ€™s winnerAllie McLaughlin(43:11) in third followed shortly byJade Belzbergin fourth andDani Morenoin fifth. There may have been a small gap at the front of the race between the leader and the rest of the field, but the competition remained fierce between second through fifth places and beyond.

On a well-deserved descent from Washeau Peak, runners drop 1,200 feet in 2.5 miles to Shirley Basin, passing Siberia (the second checkpoint) on their way at mile 7.8. The womenâ€™s race remained steady as the runners held their positions. Njeru increased her lead by another minute (1:21:12) against Hemming (1:24:08), setting her up well for the raceâ€™s second half. McLaughlin closed the gap in third place (1:24:59) while the race remained tight, with Belzberg only 30 seconds back in fourth. Moreno (1:28:15) ran in fifth.																					
After descending into Shirley Basin, the runners next climbed 550 feet back up to checkpoint three at the High Camp aid station at 10.5 miles. It was during the ascent that Belzberg started to make her attack. Njeru (1:44:50) and Hemming (1:47:22) remained in first and second as they passed the checkpoint, but Belzberg overtook McLaughlin, taking over the third-place position in 1:48:15. However, the gap remained tight with McLaughlin reaching High Camp at 1:48:53 and Moreno three minutes behind at 1:52:00.

It was Joyce Muthoni Njeru who crossed the finish line first at 2:11:52. But it was tight.																					
Jade Belzberg made up a lot of time on the steep descent to finish in second place, just over 30 seconds behind Njeru in 2:12:29. It was an incredible race for the athlete who managed to take a podium spot in the last few miles of the route.																					
Tabor Hemming came through the finish in third in 2:13:31, while last yearâ€™s winner, Allie McLaughlin, finished in 2:14:53 for fourth place. Dani Moreno maintained fifth place in 2:17:04. It was an exciting end for the womenâ€™s top positions.

The favorite for the 23k race was last yearâ€™s winner and 2023 Mont Blanc Marathon runner-up,Eli Hemmingâ€” also the husband of womenâ€™s third-place finisher Tabor Hemming. However, it was Kenyan athletePatrick Kipngenowho took the lead into checkpoint one, setting a tone for the day. Kipngeno came in at 32:49, one minute faster than Hemming. He was followed shortly after by Kenyan athletePhilemon Ombogo Kiriago(34:15) andTaylor Stack,who remained close behind in third and fourth. Just 30 seconds later,Meikael Beaudoin-Rousseauentered the first checkpoint at 35:24, a spread of about 2.5 minutes for the top five men.

Meanwhile, Kipngeno continued to increase the gap between himself (1:04:36) and Hemming (1:06:25) some 7.8 miles in at Siberia, the second checkpoint. Situated just after the raceâ€™s highest peak, athletes face a challenging climb, scrambling at the top, followed by a steep descent. Next to the checkpoint were Kiriago, Stack, and Beaudoin-Rousseau.																					
There was less drama in the menâ€™s race, with no significant changes as Kipngeno managed to hold onto his lead on the last incline to the High Camp aid station, passing the checkpoint at 1:23:24 and Hemming at 1:25:21, still taking a two-minute lead on last yearâ€™s champion, the same gap as at the prior checkpoint. Another two minutes later, Kiriago crossed through at 1:27:13, followed by Stack (1:28:30) and Beaudoin-Rousseau (1:29:59).																					
It was no surprise that Patrick Kipngeno took first place, crossing the finish line in 1:45:37, followed by Eli Hemming in 1:47:00 for second place.

2024 Comrades Marathon Results: Gerda Steyn Sets Course Record	 Piet Wiersma Wins Menâ€™s Race,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-comrades-marathon-results,"At 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, June 9, in the raucous darkness of Durban, South Africa, more than 20,000 runners, powered by nerves, adrenaline, and the â€œChariots of Fireâ€ theme song, crossed the start line of the 2024Comrades Marathonto take part in the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world: nearly 86 kilometers of road running throughout the hills of South Africaâ€™s KwaZulu-Natal province. It was the 97th running of the event, which has only missed four editions since World War I veteranVic Claphamstarted it in 1921 to commemorate the lives of South African soldiers.

Two of the runners â€”Gerda Steyn, of South Africa but who lives in the United Arab Emirates, on the womenâ€™s side andPietWiersmaof The Netherlands on the menâ€™s â€” cemented their names in race lore by taking home wins, and sizable paydays, in their respective races. The race has a massive prize purse, with a total 4,092,000 Rand ($217,000) on the line.																					
Steyn, the defending champion, broke her own course record for the Up run direction by more than nine minutes for her third win at Comrades. She also holds the womenâ€™s course record for the Down run when the race is held in the opposite direction, which she set in 2023.																					
Wiersma, meanwhile, backed up his impressive Comrades debut last year â€” where he finished second only three seconds behind the winner â€” with his first win at the race.																					
The Comrades Marathon famously alternates the direction each year, and this yearâ€™s race, which was run in relatively ideal conditions with temperatures ranging from the mid-50s to low-70s Fahrenheit, was the 49th Up race, meaning runners began in the lower-altitude Durban and ended in the higher-altitude Pietermaritzburg. The race featured around 1,750 meters of elevation gain, with most of it during the first half of the race, when the course runs through three of its â€œBig Fiveâ€ hills. The Up run, therefore, demands a smart, measured racing strategy.

For the raceâ€™s first half,PietWiersma(The Netherlands) seemed content to stay conservative and save his energy for the back half. A two-man pack ofJobo Khatoane(Lesotho), looking for his first Comrades finish, andAleksei Beresnev(Russia), back for a second time after debuting inside the top 10 last year, were within a minute of each other at Drummond, around the halfway mark, with the next runner more than five minutes back and Wiersma sitting in 10th, almost nine-and-a-half minutes off the lead.																					
But then Wiersma dropped the hammer, increasing his pace to 3:37 per kilometer from 3:58 per kilometer to jump into the top five by the Cato Ridge checkpoint at 56.6 kilometers into the race. That seemingly set the tone for big moves for the raceâ€™s second half, where Beresnev was still holding the lead and followed byDegefa Yohannese Lafebo(Ethiopia). With this race, Lafebo was moving up in distance following two top-10 finishes at the Two Oceans Marathon, a 50k race.																					
South AfricansTete Dijana, the two-time defending champion, andDan Moselakwe, a prior Comrades podium finisher,Â sat in third and fourth, respectively.																					
Wiersma continued to run strong and moved into the lead by Umlaas Road, 67.5k, passing Lafebo, and by Mkondeni at 79.1k, he had increased to nearly a minute. Behind him, Beresnev dropped off the pace, while Dijana couldnâ€™t hang on, either. The pair would finish, but outside the top 10 this year.																					
Moselakwe took advantage of fading runners to move himself into second.Joseph Manyedi(South Africa), meanwhile, methodically moved his way up to finish in fourth, his eighth and best Comrades finish, whileAndrew Davies(U.K.) jumped from 12th to fifth over the course of the second half of the race. This was Daviesâ€™ first Comrades finish.																					
At the finish line, Wiersma would stay clear of Moselakwe by 45 seconds and third-place finisher Lafebo by nearly three minutes.

Gerda Steyn(South Africa, lives in the United Arab Emirates), who won the Comrades Marathon in 2023 and 2019 and is also set to run the Olympic Marathon in Paris, France, later this summer, was at or near the front of the race from the beginning. At the 5.5k and Pinetown (18.5k) checkpoints, she sat in a group withCarla Molinaro(U.K.) andLoveness Madziva(Zimbabwe).																					
Molinaro was a six-time Comrades finisher with her best performance last year in third place, and Madziva was looking for her first Comrades finish after lots of strong performances around the 50k distance. Those three women led a tight pack of runners through Winston Park (29.6k), with the top 10 women all within six minutes of the lead.																					
But then Steyn picked up her pace by four seconds per kilometer to gap Madziva by almost a minute by Drummond (42.6k), about halfway into the race. By then, the 10th-place runner was more than 10 minutes back of Steyn.																					
Steynâ€™s lead only increased over the latter half of the race, but behind her, there was significant movement within the field.Alexandra Morozova(Russia), the 2022 champion and a many-time Comrades podium finisher, made a big move between the Umlaas Road (67.5k) and Mkondeni (79.1k) checkpoints, dropping her pace by nearly 10 seconds per kilometer to pass Molinaro andNobukhosi Tshuma(Zimbabwe) and jump from fourth to second, a position she wouldnâ€™t relinquish. Tshuma was another runner looking to move up in distance after successful shorter-distance ultrarunning.																					
Perhaps the most dramatic move, though, came from AmericanCourtney Olsen, who methodically made her way into the lead pack throughout the race. By Drummond, she was in ninth place before jumping three spots at Umlaas Road. As Pietermaritzburg approached, Olsen jumped three more spots to finish third. Olsenâ€™s incredible debut Comrades follows up on prior top-five finishes at the IAU 50k and 100k World Championships.																					
No one, though, could get close to Steyn, who raised her arms in triumph as she broke the tape under a cloudless blue sky and took a small bow, setting a new womenâ€™s Up run record and finishing more than 15 minutes ahead of second-place Morozova.

2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results: Jon Albon and Ruth Croft Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-transvulcania-ultramarathon-results,"The 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon getting underway. All photos courtesy of race.																					
TheTransvulcania Ultramarathonis well-known for bringing in talented runners worldwide and being a highly competitive race. The 2024 edition was no different.																					
Early on the morning of Saturday, May 11, racers set off on their 72-kilometer (44.7 miles) journey, starting at the southern tip of La Palma island, one of the Canary Islands, at the lighthouse of El Faro de Fuencaliente. The raceâ€™s finish line is set on the islandâ€™s west side in the city of Los Llanos de Aridane. Racers had to use their strength as they accumulated around 14,000 feet (4,350 meters) of gain.																					
The course is as beautiful as it is challenging. Aside from the seemingly non-stop climbs to the courseâ€™s high point just after 50k and a 1,000-foot (320-meter) climb from the ocean to the finish, racers must somehow manage the nearly 8,000-foot (2,400 meters) descent from the high point to the ocean over the course of less than 11 miles (18k). Dominated by singletrack, the course tackles challenging terrain, including loose volcanic pumice and sharp lava rock.																					
Five years after attempting the Transvulcania Ultramarathon and coming in fourth place,Jon Albonfinally found his way back to the island of La Palma. He claimed his crown, winning the 2024 edition. On the womenâ€™s side,Ruth Croftalso found her way back to the island, in her case eight years had passed. She made up for the lost years and not only came away with the victory but also the womenâ€™s course record.																					
Read on for more of how the race played out.																					
There were no fewer than 9 previous Transvulcania wins represented on the start line, including Dakota Jones (left, 2 wins) and Luis Alberto Hernando (right, 3 wins).																					
The menâ€™s race was one that wouldnâ€™t be lost early, as at least 10 men rolled into the second aid station at Deseadas (17k) within 73 seconds of the lead. There was a distinct lead pack withJeshurun SmallandDakota Jonesof the U.S.,Tom EvansandJon Albonof the U.K, andThibaut Baronianof France.Ben Stout(U.S.),Dimtry Mityaev(Andorra),Davide Cheraz(Italy), andAntoine Thiriat(France) were all within a minute of the lead.																					
Fourteen kilometers later, at El ReventÃ³n (31k), four of the five essentially remained in the lead pack, with only Jones dropping back to sixth while Stout moved up into fifth at 2.5 and 2 minutes off the lead, respectively. Technically, Baronian was 19 seconds off the lead trio of Albon, Small, and Evans. Cheraz,Ionel Manole(Romania, living in Spain), Mityaev, andTobias Geiser(Italy) rounded out the top 10.																					
Fast forward to the high point at El Roque de los Muchachos (51k), and we finally started to see some gaps between the top men, even if that was mostly Albon pulling away from the rest of the leaders. Indeed, Albon hit el Roque with a 4.5-minute lead on Small and a 5.5-minute lead on Mityaev, while Baronian and Evans sat 6 minutes back.																					
Jon Albon in the lead in La Palmaâ€™s high country.																					
From there, gaps quickly grew with Stout at 8.5 minutes, Manole at 18 minutes, andManuel Anguita(Spain) at 19.5 minutes back in sixth through eighth as the only other runners within 20 minutes of the lead. Not long after El ReventÃ³n, Jones quickly fell behind the lead pack to eventually finish in 17th.																					
The colossal 8,000-foot, 11-mile descent down to the seaside town of Tazacorte saw two of the previous top five runners fall back, while three held their position or moved up. Albon hit the ocean with the same 4.5-minute lead he had an hour and a half earlier high atop the island. Ah, but Evans made up 90 seconds to move into second along with teammate Mityaev over the descent.

At the same time, Small fell into fourth at 8.5 minutes off the lead. From there, there was a substantial gap back to the next runners with Manole, Stout,Pere Aurell(Spain), and Anguita all under 20 minutes off the lead. Baronian deployed his parachute on the descent and ended it in ninth, more than 30 minutes off the front.																					
As the men made their way into the city center of Los Llanos de Aridane, Jon Albon held on to win in 7:03:10.																					
Making up 2 minutes on Albon over the final 5k climb, teammates Dmitry Mityaev and Tom Evans finished hand in hand, tying in 7:05:16.																					
Although he lost some time on the descent, Jeshurun Small ran strong over the final kilometers to take fourth in 7:10:54. Ionel Manole threw down a furious final sprint to beat out Ben Stout and hold onto fifth by 11 seconds, with the pair finishing in 7:19:21 and 7:19:32, respectively.

Despite having a stacked field, the womenâ€™s race was dominated already in its early kilometers. By Deseadas (17k), Ruth Croft (New Zealand) had a 2.5-minute lead on Ida Nilsson (Sweden, lives in Norway), but Nilsson was, in turn, nearly 5 minutes in front of the rest of the womenâ€™s field.																					
Here,Azara GarcÃ­a(Spain) andEkaterina Mityaeva(Andorra) ran in third and fourth at 7 minutes off the lead withMarianne Hogan(Canada) andHannah Allgood(U.S.) less than a minute back.Keely Henninger(U.S.),Sunmaya Budha(Nepal),Emilie Collomb(Italy), andHillary Allen(U.S.) were the rest of the top 10 women at 9, 9.5, 10.5, and 13 minutes off the lead.																					
Ruth Croft running in the lead late in the 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon.																					
Croft continued to pull away from the field en route to El ReventÃ³n (31k), where she built a 4.5-minute lead on Nilsson. Budha held strong to move into third place at 12 minutes off the lead while the rest of the womenâ€™s field continued to fall off Croftâ€™s furious pace. Hogan and GarcÃ­a ran 13 and 14 minutes off the lead in fourth and fifth, respectively. While we donâ€™t have a split for Mityaeva at El ReventÃ³n, she was sixth at the aid stations before and after that location.																					
And then Nilsson dropped the hammer with a tremendous surge to catch Croft before El Roque de los Muchachos at 51k. At the same time, the lead duo continued to build time on the rest of the womenâ€™s field. Budha continued to run in third at the high point at 15 minutes off the front. At the same time, Allgood had run her way up into fourth roughly 24 minutes off the front with Hogan holding onto fifth at 28 minutes off the lead.																					
Ida Nilsson (right) briefly leading Ruth Croft at the raceâ€™s high point.																					
For perspective on just how well Croft and Nilsson were running up front through 51k, the sixth through ninth women at 50k were Mityaeva,Katharina Hartmuth(Germany), GarcÃ­a, and Henninger, all of whom have world-class ultrarunning resumes and yet ran from 32 to 47 minutes off the leaders.																					
Wow! Of Croft and Nilsson, it was Croft who had the downhill legs on the day. The Kiwi put 8 minutes on the Swede over the 8,000 feet and just over 90 minutes of descending to the ocean. Budha held her own on the descent, actually gaining a minute on Croft, but still sitting in third 14 minutes off the lead. At that point, the womenâ€™s podium seemed set with just 5k to go.																					
Still, only 6 minutes separated the women in fourth through sixth. Mityaeva had made up ground on the descent to move into fourth at 34 minutes off the front. Allgood and Hogan raced in fifth and sixth, at 2 and 6 minutes behind Mityaeva.																					
Ruth Croft continued her phenomenal run to the finish, coming across the line in a womenâ€™s course record time of 8:02:49, lowering Ida Nilssonâ€™s time of 8:04:16 from 2017.																					
Ida Nilsson rolled into the finish to take second in 8:16:32.																					
Sunmaya Budha continued to close in on Nilsson, but ultimately finished in third in 8:20:31.																					
Ekaterina Mityaeva held onto fourth in 8:40:59, while Hannah Allgood finished in fifth in 8:43:23.

2024 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: Entrekin and Subertas Prevail in Dramatic Race Finishes,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-cocodona-250-mile-results-entrekin-and-subertas-prevail-in-dramatic-race-finishes,"With the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile frontrunners having crossed the finish line in Flagstaff, Arizona,Rachel EntrekinandHarry Subertasare winners of the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s races. Both prevailed through truly dramatic and fascinating race stories.																					
The race began at 5 a.m. local time on Monday, May 6, and concludes on Saturday, May 11. This edition marked the raceâ€™s fourth running.																					
The point-to-point route begins in Black Canyon City and finishes in Flagstaff. The course changes from year to year, but this yearâ€™s course is said to be 249.4 miles long with roughly 40,000 feet of climbing and 35,000 feet of descending.																					
On the course, runners experience the diversity of Arizonaâ€™s terrain and climate. In the low desert, runnable singletrack and doubletrack give runners terrain simplicity, but thatâ€™s complicated by heat and lack of shade from the sun. The course also visits a couple of mountain ranges, which provide shade and cool temperatures but can bring the challenges of altitude, significant elevation gain and loss, and more technical terrain.

A 250-mile-long race offers nearly infinite logistical challenges, with runners needing to stay on point with hydration and fueling, sleep and other forms of rest, gear management, foot care, and so much more.																					
While the course has changed significantly in most previous years, the records for the current course areSarah Ostaszewskifor the women at 72 hours, 50 minutes, and 27 seconds, and 69:41:31 for the men byMichael McKnight, both run in 2023, the only time a substantially similar course was used.																					
With all these variables, the Cocodona 250 Mile was sure to deliver surprises for all runners, including those at the front of the race.																					
Rachel Entrekin, an ultrarunner since at least 2013, championed the womenâ€™s race. After running for most of the distance in second place, Entrekin took over the womenâ€™s race leadership late to secure the win. This followed longtime womenâ€™s race leaderMika Thewesâ€™sudden â€” lengthy, but temporary â€” stop around mile 233.																					
The menâ€™s race came down to the wire betweenHarry SubertasandJeff Browning. Browning, a veteran of at least 150 ultras, led for most of the race. Subertas, winner of the 2022 Tahoe 200 Mile, started the race more conservatively. Subertasâ€™ smart pacing allowed him to pass Browning to take over the lead with just a few miles to go â€” in a 250-mile race â€” to win and set a new course record.																					
Runners continued to trickle over the finish line at the time of this articleâ€™s publishing, ahead of the 125-hour time limit. Read on for more of the race story.																					
Phew, what a womenâ€™s race.Rachel Entrekintook over the race leadership late to win after longtime race leaderMika Thewessuddenly stopped during the third night of racing, around mile 233. Entrekin has won several 48-hour races, including most recently the 2023 Across the Years 48 Hour, where she finished with 212 miles. Sheâ€™s also a 100-mile specialist, as UltraSignup shows sheâ€™s won at least eight 100 milers.																					
But letâ€™s back up to the race start.																					
When the women settled into the early miles of racing on Monday morning, Mika Thewes, who has no less than twelve 200-plus-mile race finishes, including two Cocodona finishes, with a third place in 2023 and a fourth in 2021, ran as the race leader. Over the course of that first day, other top womenâ€™s runners, Entrekin,Aliza Lapierre, andLiz Canty, closely chased.																					
During night 1, however, Entrekin passed Thewes to assume the womenâ€™s lead. As of mid-morning on Tuesday, around 26 hours into the race, Thewes trailed in second place by about two miles, and Lapierre was the third woman.

Around 32 hours into the race, on the afternoon of day 2, Thewes retook the womenâ€™s lead, which she would hold for over 100 miles. The pass happened at the Jerome aid station, mile 126 â€” the raceâ€™s halfway point mileage-wise â€” when Entrekin arrived first, and Thewes arrived second, but Thewes left first while Entrekin stayed in the aid station for a couple of hours, likely to take a nap.																					
At this midway point mileage-wise, Lapierre maintained third position, despite sharing with the race organization that she was having a rough race thus far. The Brazilian living in Spain,Manu Vilasecaran a couple of miles behind Lapierre in fourth place, looking like she had the potential to move up in the rankings.																					
As night 2 arrived, Thewes opened her lead on the womenâ€™s field to seven miles, while Entrekin and Lapierre continued to occupy positions two and three.																					
By daybreak on Wednesday morning, the raceâ€™s 48-hour mark, Thewes passed mile 175 and had increased her lead to about 9.5 miles. Entrekin ran in second, while, overnight, Vilaseca assumed the womenâ€™s third-place position and was now running right behind Entrekin.																					
During the day on Wednesday, Thewes increased her lead by a lot. When the race hit 60 hours elapsed on Wednesday evening, Thewes was just under 220 miles into the race with a nearly 20-mile lead.																					
Behind Thewes, Vilaseca and Entrekin were locked in a close duel all day Wednesday, vying for second and third places. Coming up on Wednesday night and 60 hours elapsed, Vilaseca put some distance between her and Entrekin, running 2.5 miles ahead of her.

But this trio still had a fair bit of real estate to cover, and anything can â€” and did â€” happen. Overnight on night 3, the landscape of the womenâ€™s race totally changed. Entrekin passed Vilaseca to take over second place once again. Then, around mile 233, Thewes suddenly stopped, and it was thought that sheâ€™d dropped from the race. Entrekin assumed the womenâ€™s race lead, which put Vilaseca in second place.Kylee Drugan-Eppichmoved up into third position.																					
In the soft light after dawn on Thursday morning, Rachel Entrekin smoothly ran into downtown Flagstaff, to win the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile in 73:31:25. At the finish, she took a seat, shook her head, and said, â€œSo easy.â€																					
Manu Vilaseca took second in 78:04:35. Vilaseca has a big ultra resume dating back to before 2011. Her top races in recent years have included a win at the 2022 Bryce Canyon 100 Mile and 5th place at the 2019 TDS. It looks like this is her first finish of a 200-plus-mile race.																					
Against all odds, at around the 77-hour mark, mid-morning on Thursday, the race organization shared on the event livestream that Thewes had stopped in the night due to an injury from a fall, sought medical attention, and was cleared by both medical and the race organization to restart the race where sheâ€™d stopped. So, roughly 12 hours after stopping, she rejoined the race, assuming third place, with Drugan-Eppich moving back to fourth position.																					
Mika Thewes finished third, for a second year in a row, in 79:30:12, with some super-fast final miles.																					
Kylee Drugan-Eppich was the fourth woman in80:04:55, looking fresh and strong during her run to the finish line through the streets of Flagstaff. This looks to be Drugan-Eppichâ€™s first 200-plus-mile race, and it also looks like she has just one 100-mile finish to her name, a win of the 2022 Zion 100 Mile.																					
Carrie Hendersonwas the fifth woman to finish in 83:37:40. This looks to be Hendersonâ€™s second Cocodona finish	 she was sixth place in 2022.

Talk about a closing effort:Harry Subertaswon the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile menâ€™s race by taking over the lead in the raceâ€™s final miles to set a new course record. Here are the dynamics of how this played out.																					
From the starting line on Monday in Black Canyon City,Joe McConaughytook the menâ€™s race out, leading for much of the first day and night. McConaughy was the 2022 Cocodona champion, and he holds the current menâ€™s supported fastest known time on the 817-mile Arizona Trail.																					
Trailing McConaughy throughout the first day of running were top menJeff Browning,Arlen Glick,Michael Versteeg,Jeff Garmire,Michael McKnight, and others.																					
Overnight Monday night, on the first night of the race, Browning overtook first-day leader McConaughy to assume the lead of the menâ€™s race. And as night turned to sunrise on Tuesday, and the race clock ticked past 24 hours, Browning had built an approximately five-mile lead.																					
Browning maintained the same approximate gap on second place during day 2, passing the 150-mile mark with roughly a four-mile lead. Around midafternoon on day 2, some 33 hours in, McConaughy ran as second man, and Glick in third place, only a few miles apart from each other. However, very close to Glick were Versteeg andHarry Subertas, the latter looking super fresh and like he could move up after a more conservative first day and a half of racing.																					
Harry Subertas won the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile via a come-from-behind performance where he only took over the race lead with a few miles left in the race. Photo: Howie Stern																					
When the sun set on day 2, Browningâ€™s gap on second place McConaughy was roughly three miles. By now Subertas had moved up to third position.																					
At sunrise on Wednesday, as the race clock ticked past 48 hours, Browning passed the raceâ€™s 200-mile mark. Overnight, he maintained his lead by about four miles. Subertas, meanwhile, continued to move up, assuming second place, with McConaughy now in third at around nine miles back of second. Glick was now in fourth, just behind McConaughy.																					
During the third day of racing, on Wednesday, Browningâ€™s lead shrunk rapidly as Subertas in second inched closer. At the final aid station, at mile 242, Subertas was only about 17 minutes in arrears. Then, less than an hour later, when the duo came off the final descent for the final three-mile run from the outskirts of Flagstaff to its downtown finish, Subertas led by roughly five minutes, running at a solid clip, while Browning looked to be walking it in.

Harry Subertas arrived to the finish line in Flagstaff, Arizona, the menâ€™s 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile champion, setting a new course record in 59 hours, 50 minutes, and 55 seconds.																					
Jeff Browning took a super solid second, finishing in 60:19:57, just under 30 minutes behind the winner.																					
Glick made fast work of day 3, moving solidly into third position. At mile 235, he was four miles behind second place, and seven miles ahead of fourth place. Steady forward movement would ensure him the final menâ€™s podium spot, and thatâ€™s exactly what he did. When all was said and done, Arlen Glick took third, in his first 200-plus-mile race, in61:46:57.																					
In the evening hours of night 3, Joe McConaughy, the 2022 Cocodona champion, finished in fourth place in 64:03:02. Inaugural 2021 Cocodona champion, Michael Versteeg, took fifth in 65:45:20.

2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k Results: Farvard Has Breakout Win, Schide Storms,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-canyons-by-utmb-100k-results,"At the 2024Canyons by UTMB 100k,Rod Farvardhad a breakout performance to win the menâ€™s race andKatie Schide(U.S., lives in France) ran an absolute stormer to win for the women.																					
While this year marked the eventâ€™s 10th edition, if thereâ€™s anything weâ€™ve grown to understand, change is constant at this race. With significant course changes in many editions, this year was no different. Starting at China Wall, a trailhead located in the mid-foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the race traveled roughly east to west â€” with some deviations â€” to finish in downtown Auburn, California. Runners traveled an overall downhill trending course, still with over 12,000 feet of climbing over the course of 63 miles.																					
A chunk of the middle of the course traversed the famous Western States Trail, and included some of its iconic parts, such as the Devilâ€™s Thumb climb, a stiff climb that finishes passing a thumb-looking rock	 the Deadwood Cemetary, a historic cemetery	 and Cal Street, an almost-20-mile, mostly downhill, and mostly a gloriously runnable piece of real estate.

The race started at 5 a.m. local time on Saturday, April 27, under clear skies, with mild temperatures and relatively dry air predicted all day. This was perhaps a welcome reprieve for runners, as the region had seen significant rainfall in the prior days.																					
This race held lots of competitive appeal in that it was the last Western States 100 Golden Ticket race ahead of the 2024 event, where the two women and men would earn entry into the race.																					
The event was also a UTMB World Series Major, meaning the top 10 men and women secured entry into the CCC at the UTMB World Series Finals, which will be held this August in Chamonix, France.																					
The menâ€™s race went out en masse, with around 20 men within 2 minutes of each other at the first aid station at Deadwood 1 (16k). Leading this loose pack werePetter Engdahl(Sweden, lives in Norway),Rod Farvard, andAdam Peterman. By Deadwood 2 (29k), the second aid station, Engdahl and Farvard still led together, again with a long line of men trailing tightly, at least 10 of them within 2 minutes, including Peterman.																					
Engdahl and Peterman were running on strong comeback stories, with Engdahl having suffered broken bones with surgery last fall in a bike crash, and Peterman returning after at least a year off due to serious injury. Each would avenge these career complications with finishes today, Engdahl on the podium and Peterman in 13th.																					
And Farvard, like so many men, was hunting one of those Western States 100 Golden Tickets	 with 3 prior attempts at that race, heâ€™d only topped out as high as 11th place, clearly less than his potential.																				
Among the early near leaders through the first 30k also includedStephen Kersh,Tracen Knopp,Preston Cates, andDrew Holmen.																					
Michigan Bluff (38k) saw some more of the same, with Engdahl and Kersh leading the train and most of the same men following very closely. Though there were some 6 men right there, Farvard technically beeped into the checkpoint in third place.																					
The village of Foresthill, 48k into the race, marked something of a transition point in the race where the runners head out of the raceâ€™s higher country, and down to the lowest terrain of the Sierra Nevada. The competition was also transitional in Foresthill as it was here where eventual menâ€™s champ Farvard arrived in the lead in 4:13:43, with Kersh about 20 seconds back. Another 2 minutes brought menâ€™s second and third place, Holmen and Engdahl.																					
From there on, Farvard would not yield the lead. At 61k, the Cal 2 aid station, he passed at 5:16:19 elapsed. This time Kersh checked in a little over a minute back. Here, Holmen was holding in third, 2 minutes off second, andMakai Clemonshad now moved into fourth position, another 2 minutes back from third place. But it was still any manâ€™s race, with a spread of less than 13 minutes between first and ninth places.																					
At Driverâ€™s Flat (76k), Farvard held tight to his small but solid lead, passing through in 6:33:33. This time, Holmen had moved into second place, 3 minutes behind the lead. Kersh was right there, though, 30 seconds off Holmen.																					
For the raceâ€™s final quarter, Farvard added bits of distance between he and second place, passing through the final two aid stations, Mammoth Bar (88k) and Confluence (94k), with respective 5- and 7-minute leads. Rod Farvard looked totally elated to cross the finish line, winning the menâ€™s race in 8:44:30. He gladly accepted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket.

Behind him, Holmen ran a super steady last 25k, and built a meaningful enough gap on the rest of the field, passing through the 88k and 94k aid stations some 6 and 4 minutes ahead of third place, respectively. When Drew Holmen crossed the line to take second in 8:51:09, he tossed his pack and collapsed to the ground, clearly using most of what he had in him for that performance. After some finish-line contemplation, Holmen declined the Golden Ticket, which meant it would roll down to third place.																					
But who would be the third-place finisher? As we know, ultimately, Engdahl. After sitting in fifth place as late as 88k, he surged to move up two spots when he passed the 94k aid station. Petter Engdahlâ€™s excellent ultra pacing led him to take third in 8:55:31. He was eager to claim the second menâ€™s Western States Golden Ticket.																					
Having run a hugely consistent race, Makai Clemens finished fourth in 8:57:38. Stephen Kersh, after pushing the menâ€™s race pace earlier, found himself in fifth at 9:05:56.

The start of the womenâ€™s race couldnâ€™t have played out more differently from the menâ€™s.Katie Schide(U.S., lives in France) took the womenâ€™s race out, created a gap early, and ran on. By the first aid station at Deadwood 1 (16k), Schide had already built a gap on the field, some 2.5 minutes. She grew that gap by the second aid point at Deadwood 2 (29k) to nearly 9.5 minutes.																					
Schide, with too many accolades to mention, wassecond at last yearâ€™s Western States 100and has her eyes on the prize of that race this year. Undoubtedly, this race was a critical step in her preparations for this yearâ€™s edition.																					
EmKay Sullivanwas a womenâ€™s pace pusher over the first 30k, running around Schide early on, assuming the second position after that, and never looking back. Sullivan has loads of strong trail race performances to her name, with all of them at shorter distances than this one.																					
Mary Denholmfeatured prominently in podium position over the first 30k, having passed through the 16k and 29k aid stations in podium position. Denholm is a 2-time Olympic Marathon Trials qualifier with a 2:36:28 marathon PR, who was basically debuting in trail racing.																					
Also among the mix for the women over the first 30k wereAddie Bracyas well as AustraliansAnna McKennaandStephanie Auston.																					
By Michigan Bluff (39k), Schide led by about 11 minutes. Sullivan remained Schideâ€™s closest chaser, with Denholm in third place, just under 13 minutes off the lead.																					
Ten kilometers later, at Foresthill (49k), the Schide Show was officially in full force, with her arriving at 4:25:14 and with more than 21 minutes of real estate to the next woman. Sullivan and Denholm maintained their second- and third-place positions, around 2 minutes apart from each other. Behind Denholm was also some decent daylight, with fourth-place Bracy coming through about 10.5 minutes after third place.																					
Schide was truly ablaze at Cal 2, the 61k, some two-thirds of the way down Cal Street, running through in 5:31:21. There, sheâ€™d also cracked the overall top 10. Due to a lack of womenâ€™s coverage in the live stream as well as issues with Sullivanâ€™s tracking devices, we donâ€™t have her split at Cal 2, but she was in second place here. Denholm was the next woman through in third, 65 minutes off the lead.																					
At Driverâ€™s Flat (76k), Schide was now picking her way through the menâ€™s top 10, passing in sixth overall in 6:50:38. For the record, thatâ€™s 17 minutes back from the menâ€™s leader three-quarters of the way through a trail 100k â€” some insane running. Schideâ€™s lead in the womenâ€™s race would only grow over the raceâ€™s final quarter, and she remained in sixth place overall at the finish line. At Mammoth Bar (88k) and Confluence (94k), she led by 44 and 46 minutes respectively.																					
Ultimately, Katie Schide was the runaway womenâ€™s victor in 9:10:10. Itâ€™s safe to say that things are looking really good for Schideâ€™s second attempt at the Western States 100 this summer. With her automatic entry based on her top-10 finish last year, the two Western States 100 Golden Tickets would roll down to other women.

Sullivanâ€™s race for second place never wavered. At 88k and 94k, she held a respective 7- and 9-minute gap over third place. EmKay Sullivan cruised over the finish line to take second in 10:01:26. While she cautiously accepted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket at the finish line, she later decided to not officially accept it, which meant it would roll down to another woman.																					
Behind Schide and Sullivan, the race for the womenâ€™s top 10 was anything but set in the raceâ€™s final 25k. Denholm, the debut trail racer, ran into problems en route to Driverâ€™s Flat (76k), relinquishing her podium position. At the time of this articleâ€™s publishing, sheâ€™s not showing an official DNF, but she certainly has.																					
As the womenâ€™s positions fluctuated, it would beAnna Louden (nÃ©e Kascius)who emerged into the third position by 88k and who would hold it until she finished in 10:24:37. Kacius has about 3 years of ultrarunning under her belt, with top finishes including seventh at the 2022 IAU 100k World Championships, and fourth at the 2023 Black Canyon 100k. She narrowly missed a Golden Ticket by one position at that latter event. This time, she was golden, graciously accepting that Western States 100 entry.																					
Careth Arnoldfinished fourth in 10:38:42, after moving up into that spot before the 94k aid station. When the second Western States 100 Golden Ticket rolled down to her post-race, she accepted it. Anna McKenna rounded out the womenâ€™s top 5, crossing the line in 10:43:31.

2024 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: New Winners with Valmassoi and Dhiman,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-madeira-island-ultra-trail-results-new-winners-with-valmassoi-and-dhiman,"Leaving the seaside village of Porto Moniz at midnight on Saturday, April 27, runners in the 2024Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) set off from northwest Madeira on their 115-kilometer (72 miles) run across the small Portuguese island in the Atlantic Ocean. When all was said and done,Martina Valmassoi(Italy) andBen Dhiman(U.S., lives in France) took home the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s victories.																					
But there was a lot of landscape and racing in between.																					
With 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of climbing, the route is technical, steep, and demanding. Starting at sea level and finishing on the far eastern end of the island at Machico, back at sea level again, runners travel over countless mountains, including the routeâ€™s high point, Pico Ruivo at 1,800 meters (5,900 feet). Thousands of stairs are also infamous on this race course, which adds a unique element to the racing experience. The route treats runners to stunning views of big mountains, the ocean, and everything in between.

While last yearâ€™s race was less competitive than other editions, this year promised to serve up fast racing on the womenâ€™s side with a list of starters includingAnne-Lise Rousset SÃ©guret(France),Martina Valmassoi(Italy),Claire Bannwarth(France), andMaite Maiora(Spain), who all had the potential to mix it up at the front of the race.																					
On the menâ€™s side, the likes ofMiguel ArsÃ©nio(Portugal),Ben Dhiman(U.S., lives in France),Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon(France), andSebastian Krogvig(Norway) promised a show.																					
Last yearâ€™s French sweep of the event was not to be repeated with new faces dominating the podium this edition. On the menâ€™s side, Dhiman, who placed third at the 2023 Les Templiers, ran near the front of the race for its entirety and pulled away from the rest of the field after the high point, 75 kilometers into the race, to reach the finish line first.																					
The top 2 of the womenâ€™s race stayed tight, and the gap between Valmassoi and Rousset did not open up until well into the second half. Valmassoi, the 2022 TDS winner, ultimately broke the tape at Machico first in a time of 16:14:10.																					
Read on for the in-depth race story.																					
While on paper, a number of names were vying for the top spot in the womenâ€™s race, it ended as a duel between Italyâ€™sMartina Valmassoiand Franceâ€™sAnne-Lise Rousset SÃ©guret. After running within minutes of each other for the majority of the race and opening up a seemingly insurmountable gap on the rest of the field, it was Valmassoi who reached the oceanside at Machico first in a time of 16:14:10. Rousset was second with a time of 16:28:27, andMaite Maioraof Spain rounded out the podium with a time of 17:12:22.																					
Rousset was the first to make her intentions for the race known as she went straight to the front and created a nearly 2-minute gap on the rest of the field just 22 kilometers into the race. Valmassoi along withFiona Porte(France),Sandra Sevillano(Spain), Maiora, andAroa SÃ­o(Spain) followed to make up the top 5 in the early hours of racing. As the racers traversed the rugged mountains of Madeira, it became clear that it was shaping up to be a 2-woman race between Rousset and Valmassoi. Just 30k in, theyâ€™d stretched the gap to third-place Maiora to more than 15 minutes.

By the time the women reached the course high point at Pico Ruivo, nearly 75k into the race, the gap between the top 2, Valmassoi and Rousset, who were still close to each other, and third-place Maiora was up to 30 minutes.Claire Bannwarthof France was another 30 minutes back in fourth, with SÃ­o in fifth just 30 seconds behind her.																					
From Pico Ruivo, at an elevation of 1,800 meters, itâ€™s a long 40k downhill run to the ocean, with plenty of climbs included to keep things interesting. As the women headed toward the ocean, Valmassoi increased the 3-minute lead she held on Rousset as the 2 had crossed over the course high point. By ChÃ£o da Lagoa at the 84k mark, the gap was up to about 7 minutes.																					
Meanwhile, Maiora kept pace with the lead duo and maintained the 30-minute gap up to second. Behind her, Bannwarth and SÃ­o continued to run near each other an additional 35 minutes in arrears.																					
Valmassoi was first to Machico, holding on to a 14-minute gap over second-place Rousset. Maiora rounded out the podium in a time of 17:12:22.																					
Claire Bannwarth and Aroa Sio finished fourth and fifth respectively, with times of 17:50:24 and 18:14:53.

Full results.																					
While there was plenty of strong racing at the front end of the race in the early hours of the event, it was ultimatelyBen Dhiman, from the U.S. but who lives in France, who reached the ocean at Machico first in a time of 13:52:46. He was followed by Norwayâ€™sSebastian Krogvigand Franceâ€™sMartin Kernwho finished in 14:12:54 and 14:15:23, respectively. Fourth placeAnthony Costaof France was just 17 seconds behind. The top four men established themselves at the front at Pico de Ruivo, the high point of the race at about 75k, and never looked back.																					
Early on in the event, all of the expected top names featured at the pointy end of the race, includingMiguel ArsÃ©nio(Portugal),Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon(France),LuÃ­s Fernandes(Portugal), Dhiman,Jeff Mogavero(U.S.), Krogvig, and Kern. This lead group was within minutes of each other for the first 20k of rugged Madeira mountains.																					
Dhiman and Arsenio seemed to be on a mission to push the pace early on in the race and ran in close proximity to each other until Estanquinhos, 33k into the race. From there, it seemed like the racing was properly on, with the two of them changing leads over the next 30k.

Their pace opened up a large gap on the rest of the field. After 48k of racing, the trio of Krogvig, Kern, and Mogavero were close together coming into the Encumeada checkpoint, with the time gap between them under a minute as they battled for third place on the ground. Their gap to the front 2 leaders was nearly 10 minutes just under halfway into the race.Brian Culmo(U.S.),Francesco Cucco(Italy), and Costa followed the top 5, another 20 minutes back.																					
As the kilometers ticked by and runners reached the course high point 75 kilometers into the race, Dhiman established a clear lead on the field as ArsÃ©nio faded back and eventually dropped from the event. Krogvig, Kern, and Costa made up the rest of the top 5 at the checkpoint, with second through fourth all within 20 minutes of one another. With ArsÃ©nio dropping out, there were now 2 podium places to fight for on the back half of the course.																					
With all the big climbs over, runners simply had to make it back to the ocean. But it was far from all downhill with several significant inclines to negotiate in the final 40k. Still, very little changed at the front of the race from the high point to the finish, with Dhiman continuing to run steady at the front of the field and Krogvig, Kern, Costa, and Mogavero behind, making up the top 5. Portuguese runnersNelson Santosand Fernandez did their best to maintain contact with the lead.																					
In the final kilometers of the race, first place seemed secured, but the battle between second and fourth stayed tight. Krogvig was able to hold on to second and Kern just edged out Costa by just 17 seconds to capture the final podium place. Santos was able to close the gap to Mogavero to round out the top 5.																					
Update:Sebastian Krogvig(Norway) was originally reported to have finished second in 14:12, but he received an hour time penalty due to following an incorrect route near ChÃ£o da Lagoa at the 84k mark, and, now, he sits in seventh place in 15:12. That moves Kern into third, Costa into fourth, and Mogavero into fifth in 15:01:01.

2024 Marathon des Sables Legendary Results: Rachid El Morabity and Aziza El Amrany Victorious,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-marathon-des-sables-legendary-results,"After a week of racing, the 2024Marathon des Sables Legendarystage race has concluded in Moroccoâ€™s Sahara Desert.Rachid El MorabityandAziza El Amranytook home victory for the host country in the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s races. For El Morabity, it was his 10th win of the event, and for El Amrany, her first.																					
The seven-day, self-sufficiency stage race is often identified as one of the hardest footraces in the world. Throughout the race, runners navigate dunes, climb jebels (mountains), and run across a multitude of surfaces in an attempt to make it to the finish line.																					
Runners carry a backpack of self-sufficiency, containing the food and camping gear needed for the week	 the race organization provides only a shade tent and water. Each of the raceâ€™s six stages offers a unique challenge and no one is guaranteed to make it to the end, not even those in the elite field.

The 2024 race started on Sunday, April 14, and concluded on Saturday, April 20. This yearâ€™s 252.8-kilometer (157 miles) course was divided into the following six stages:																					
This year was set to be a fast one. The temperature at the start of the race was a moderate 18 degrees Celsius (65 Fahrenheit), making it cool compared to previous years and easier for athletes to make a quick getaway on the fairly easy first day. However, as the week went on, temperatures rose to the extreme, along with wind and sandstorms, too.																					
In the menâ€™s race, eyes were turned to the Moroccan El Morabity brothers â€” older brother Rachid and younger brotherMohamed El Morabityâ€” who were favorites leading up to the event. Moroccoâ€™sAziza Rajiwas the favorite in the womenâ€™s field, having won the race in 2021. But Moroccoâ€™s Aziza El Amrany, with two previous podium finishes over the last two years, was sure to challenge.

The competition was set during a big year of change for the longtime race, with this year being the eventâ€™s 38th edition. Iconic race founderPatrick Bauerpassed the reigns toCyril Gauthier, operator of the Half Marathon des Sables events. Through this, the week-long stage race took an evolved name, the Marathon des Sables Legendary.																					
Additionally, logistical shake-ups abound for runners on the ground, namely the shift of the notorious long stage to Stage 3 rather than Stage 4. Also, the final Stage 6 has been for some years a non-competitive charity stage, but this year it was timed and a part of the overall competition.																					
Read on for how the race played out.																					
Ahead of the race, all eyes were turned to nine-time Marathon des Sables winnerRachid El Morabityof Morocco, as well as his brotherMohamed El Morabity(Morocco), a six-time finisher with one win and five second places to his name. Rachid made a strong start to Stage 1, dashing off at an average pace of 18 kilometers per hour, testing the rest of the competition to see if they would keep up. By halfway through the first stage, Rachid slowed when his brotherMohamed El Morabity(Morocco) andAziz Yachou(Morocco) were the only athletes close behind.																					
At the end of Stage 1, it was the younger brother Mohamed in the lead, winning the stage in 2:11:09, followed by Rachid (2:11:36) and Aziz (2:11:38). In fourth, it was fellow Moroccan and older brother of Aziz,Hamid Yachou, withAhmed Ouikhalfenalso of Morocco in fifth.

Stage 2 remained steady throughout, with the top three men â€” Mohamed, Rachid, and Aziz â€” running together before crossing the finish line hand in hand ahead of the raceâ€™s longest stage the next day.

Now for the big one: Stage 3. This was the longest stage, with 85.3 kilometers (53 miles). It takes place over two days with a 35-hour cut-off time. Usually, during the long stage, we see the leaders create a gap with their competitors, just as Mohamed did this year. He started competitively and got better as the day unfolded. After 25 kilometers, Mohamed accelerated ahead of his competition through the stageâ€™s technical sections. By the end of the stage, Mohamed had a lead of over 10 kilometers, finishing in 7:37:47.																					
But the Stage 3 race wasnâ€™t over. Behind Mohamed, his brother Rachid battled it out with Aziz. Right until the last moment, the pair were head to head. With 200 meters to go Rachid launched a sprint, but Azizâ€™s speed couldnâ€™t be matched. Aziz crossed the line at 8:31:52, just one second before Rachid. There was also a surprise entrance fromYoann Stuckof France, who finished just seven minutes behind Rachid and Aziz, overtaking Hamid for fourth in the stage.

In an attempt to reclaim overall fourth place, Hamid raced ahead during the start of Stage 4 but was caught by the El Morabity brothers after the first sandy section. Despite his efforts, he was eventually overtaken by Stuck, who hung onto fourth place for the stage, beating Hamid by a mere second. Further ahead, Rachid broke away from his brother Mohamed and Aziz by the 30-kilometer mark, winning the stage and solidifying his overall second-place position ahead of Aziz in the overall standings. Mohamed and Aziz would finish together 95 seconds behind Rachid.																					
There was a dramatic turn of events during Stage 5. Mohamed started the stage with a 53-minute overall lead but started slowing by 10 kilometers into the 31-kilometer stage, slowed greatly by 20 kilometers, and stepped out of the third checkpoint with a bandage around his thigh. He limped over the finish line in 35th position. This opened up the field for Rachid and Aziz, who now both had a chance to claim first place. Rachid accelerated to the finish line, 40 seconds ahead of Aziz and, just as importantly, more than 52 minutes ahead of Mohamed.																					
The top three remained unchanged at the end of the day, but the overall competition was very tight among them heading into the raceâ€™s final stage, with Mohamed 35 seconds ahead of Rachid and 2 minutes and 51 seconds ahead of Aziz.

The battle for first place continued into the sixth and final stage, with the top three runners remaining fairly tight throughout the 21-kilometer stage. In the end, Rachid and Aziz went head to head.																					
With another sprint finish, Rachid El Morabity took a two-second lead and won the stage with a time of 1:22:05 and an overall winning time of 20:42:19, for his 10th overall victory at the race. Rachid now stands with only one other runner to have won the race 10 times, Moroccoâ€™sLahcen Ahansal.																					
Right behind was Aziz Yachou who crossed the line in 1:22:07 and finished third overall with a time of 20:44:37. This was Azizâ€™s fourth finish, and heâ€™s never finished slower than fourth place.																					
Mohamed El Morabity retained third in this stage, crossing the line a minute later than his brother in 1:23:05 and taking second overall in 20:42:44 â€” his sixth time finishing second and his seventh finish of the event.

There was no holding back at the start of the womenâ€™s race either. Moroccoâ€™sAziza El Amranyled with an average pace of 14 kilometers per hour, far ahead of the competition. Although she slowed down during the second half of Stage 1, El Amrany still finished way ahead in a time of 2:45:54 and 17th overall.																					
One of the favorites for this yearâ€™s competition,Aziza Raji(Morocco) was the 2021 winner and has placed in the top 10 in all five Marathon des Sables that sheâ€™s completed. Raji came in 26 minutes behind El Amrany and took second place for Stage 1. She was closely followed byAdriana Moserof The Netherlands in third place, a first-timer who won the most recent Half Marathon des Sables. Multi-time podium finisherGemma Game(U.K.) and three-time winnerLaurence Klein(France) followed in fourth and fifth.

Stage 2 took a surprising start as Klein tried to lead but was quickly caught by El Amrany, who went on to win the second stage. At the end of day two, the overall podium remained the same with El Amrany holding a 46-minute total lead.																					
Things remained stable on the podium for the third stage of the womenâ€™s race. There was speculation as to whether El Amrany would be able to hold her position on this, the longest stage, after two strong days. However, there was no doubt in the end, as she once again dominated most of the stage, besting Raji by 38 minutes and Moser by 78 minutes. Leading Frenchwoman Klein suffered a blow around 30 kilometers. Fortunately, her son, who was also competing, caught up with Klein and they completed the last 25 kilometers of the stage together.																					
It was another win for Aziza El Amrany in Stage 3. Photo: MDS/Ian Corless																					
During Stage 4, things started to heat up, literally. With the rising temperatures, El Amrany suffered heat exhaustion, which slowed her down but didnâ€™t stop her. She still went on to finish in first place in 4:29:41, 23 minutes ahead of Raji.																					
The biggest news of this stage came from Moser, who made an early exit just 5 kilometers into the stage. The long third stage caused severe blisters on her feet, which led to a change in stride and, eventually, leg pain. This devastating blow for Moser shifted the U.K.â€™s Game up to third position overall, whileRajaa Hamdaouaof France finished third in this stage and moved into fourth overall. Australiaâ€™sLois Pickeringmoved up to fifth place in the overall rankings for the first time.																					
Finally, it was time for Raji to shine in Stage 5. After yesterdayâ€™s heat illness and with a comfortable lead, El Amrany understandably held back in Stage 5. This left the field open for Raji to take the stage win for the first time in the race, besting El Amrany by eight seconds. Game also eased up to fifth place in the stage, but held onto third place in the overall rankings.

The race for first place was much less competitive on the final day of the womenâ€™s race as El Amrany won the sixth and final stage, taking first place in five out of the six stages and creating a good distance between her and the rest of the field. Aziza El Amrany completed the final stage in 1:41:21 and won the overall race by more than two hours with a time of 27:06:27.																					
Aziza Raji came second in this stage in 1:55:54 and overall with a time of 29:09:04.																					
Gemma Game was further out in the field for the sixth stage but still managed to retain her overall third place, with a finishing time of 32:18:58. This is her fourth finish of the event and her third time finishing in third place â€” a woman of consistency.

But letâ€™s rewind 60 hours, to the start of the 2024 edition. Runners and their crews camped in Frozen Head State Park heard the sound of the conch at 4:17 a.m. on Wednesday, March 20, signaling that they had one hour to prepare for the start of lap one of the Barkley Marathons. This was after a car alarm earlier in the night sent people scrambling for their race kit, thinking it was the sound of the conch.																					
As is tradition, no start list was published, and details from the event were scarce. Followers were glued to theTwitter feed of ultrarunner and official Barkley reporterKeith Dunn, who provided amazing and hilarious commentary throughout the 60-hour event, which officially started at 5:17 a.m. Also, a hat tip toTakawho has for several years maintainedan unofficial but excellent spreadsheet to track runnersâ€™ progress.																					
With a good weather forecast, runners were probably as optimistic as is realistically possible about completing the incredibly brutal course, which changes and gets harder every year there are finishers. With a record three finishers last year, one can only assume that race directorGary Cantrell, aka Lazarus Lake,took the routing of the 26-ish mile loop up a notch.																					
To finish the race, runners must complete five laps of the course within 60 hours, alternating directions for the first four, and then any remaining runners setting off in opposite directions on the fifth and final lap, after the first runner out on the fifth lap chooses their preferred direction.																					
The mostly off-trail race tends to cover on the order of 130 miles with 63,000 feet of elevation gain, though no one besides the race director knows for sure as GPS watches and spectators arenâ€™t allowed on the course. Runners collect pages from books hidden along the course to prove they cover each loop.																					
From the start, attention was on Paris to see if she could become the first woman to complete all five laps of the Barkley Marathons this year. She set out for her record-setting fifth and final lap with 13 hours remaining, and with five minutes until the end, all eyes were down the road. With two Fun Runs already to her name in 2022 and 2023, she completed the first three laps of this yearâ€™s race in a new womenâ€™s record time and became only the second woman in the eventâ€™s history to set out on lap four. Fun Runs consist of completing three laps of the course in 40 hours, and finishing this is considered a proper achievement in itself.																					
Then she became the first woman ever to complete the fourth lap and set out for her fifth. And ultimately, she returned to the yellow gate at the raceâ€™s start-finish line triumphant, as the fifth and final finisher for 2024.																					
Meanwhile, on the menâ€™s side, a mix of prior Barkley finishers, near finishers, and hopefuls got a record-breaking six men out on the final lap. After leading for much of the raceâ€™s second half, and getting the choice of direction for the final lap, Verys was the first one back to the yellow gate in a time of 58:44:59, an amazing run for a Barkley first-timer. Kelly came in next with a time of 59:15:38, his third finish of the event, and Campbell finished for an incredible fourth time in 59:30:32. The fourth finisher, Hamilton, reached the finish in 59:38:42.																					
Whether it was good weather, an ever-increasing amount of course knowledge, or an incredibly strong field, the 2024 editionâ€™s runners set a variety of additional records. This included a record for the number of finishers of the event in a single year, up from last yearâ€™s three, and brought the total number of people to complete the course to 20. This also includes a record 12 Barkley participants who finished Fun Runs this year, up from 10 in 2023.																					
Read more about how the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s races played out below.																					
It was a historic moment at 5:16 p.m. on Friday, March 22, under two minutes before the raceâ€™s 60-hour cutoff, at Frozen Head State Park whenJasmin Paris(U.K.) became the first woman to complete the Barkley Marathons in a time of 59:58:21. And while during the initial hours of the event, it seemed like she was well on pace to complete the event, it came down those final 99 seconds.																					
Early reports from the ground were spotty. With the entrants list of Barkley kept secret, and only some runners having outed themselves as heading to Tennessee for the event, details of how the early laps of the race played out were kept under wraps. It wasnâ€™t until she completed the second lap of the course that Keith Dunn confirmed Paris as a participant.																					
With Parisâ€™ return to the Barkley for her third attempt this year, many believed this could be the chance for a woman to finish all five laps of the course. Paris finished the three-lap Fun Run in her initial attempt at the race in 2022. At the time, she was best known for winning the 268-mile Winter Spine Race outright in 2019 with a time of 83:12:23, a record that stood until 2024.

Paris returned to Barkley in 2023, finished another Fun Run, and became only the second woman to start lap four. The first wasSue Johnstonin 2001. In this effort, she ran out of time on the fourth lap.																					
Details on how many other women joined Paris on the Barkley start line are still unavailable. We understand at least two other women made up the womenâ€™s race, includingKelly Halpin(U.S.), who tapped out midway through loop two, andLisa McFadden(U.S.). Weâ€™ll update this section if we learn about any other women in this yearâ€™s edition.																					
Paris went out strong with the top men and was part of the group of four that were the first to head out on loop three. Clearly on a mission, she finished her third loop in 32:15:53, a new Fun Run womenâ€™s record, and she also became the first woman to finish three laps three times. The previous womenâ€™s Fun Run record was set by Johnston in 2001 at 32:57:00.																					
Paris headed out for loop four at 32:27:50, and, according to Dunn, was â€œsmiling and looking good.â€ After 46:29:12, a little over 14 hours, Paris returned to the start-finish line, completing loop four and becoming the first woman to do so in the raceâ€™s 37-year history.																					
After an approximately 25-minute break, Paris headed back on course, in the clockwise direction.																					
She had about 13 hours to complete the final loop, after completing loop four in about 14 hours. On Parisâ€™ side, it was mostly daylight for the fifth lap, along with the reportedly easier-to-navigate clockwise course direction. Ultrarunning fans had a nail-biting 13-hour wait!																					
Jasmin Paris made everyone wait right up until there was just over a minute and a half left on the race clock. She touched the yellow gate at 59:58:21. She also now holds the honor of having the slowest known time on the course, a goal to which Barkley finishers aspire.																					
To learn more about Jasmin Paris, readour in-depth profile about her from 2020, written byDamian Hall(U.K.), a two-time Barkley attempter himself, including this year.																					
The early day or so of the menâ€™s race was just as mysterious as the womenâ€™s, with the identity of participants not being officially confirmed until they completed two laps. In the meantime, Keith Dunn provided insightful commentary into the situation with tweets including, â€œA tall skinny guy in a red hat is past the fire tower. #BM100â€ and â€œA guy with a gray beard and a muscular guy with tree trunk legs came through the fire tower at 12:55. #BM100.â€																					
As the hours wore on, it became clear that a deep field of men was contesting this yearâ€™s Barkley, including last yearâ€™s winnerAurÃ©lien Sanchez(France), two-time finisherJohn Kelly(U.S.), and three-time finisherJared Campbell(U.S.). They were also joined by Barkley hopefulsDamian Hall(U.K.), who started loop five last year but wasnâ€™t able to finish it	Harvey Lewis(U.S.) andTomokazu Ihara(Japan), both of whom had attempted Barkley before	 andIhor Verys(Ukraine, lives in Canada), a super strong ultrarunner starting for the first time.																			
While Dunn tweeted that early on that Laz said, â€œThe theme for the first loop this year is that you have to be able to navigate for yourself,â€ groups stayed together, and a group of five came in off of loop two together, including Kelly, Hall,SÃ©bastien Raichon(France), and Verys in 19:27:49. Itâ€™s worth noting they were joined by two-time Fun Run finisher Jasmin Paris.Â A brief 17-minute stop saw the first racers heading out for lap three.																					
Meanwhile,Greig Hamilton(New Zealand), Campbell, andMaxime Gauduin(France) finished their second loop in 19:52:36.Albert Herrero(Spain) and Sanchez followed at 20:26:04, and Ihara andThomas Dunkerbeck(The Netherlands) came in together at 22:08:53.																					
The brutal course continued to take its toll on racers with multi-time Big Dogâ€™s Backyard Ultra winner and record-holder Lewis dropping on his second loop. Sanchez tapped out on lap three saying, â€œI donâ€™t know how I did that last year.â€

The leaders marched on with Verys finishing loop three in 31:31:47. He was followed by Kelly and Hall just five minutes back in 31:36:57. Hamilton, Campbell, Raichon, Herrero, Gauduin, and Ihara all came in to complete loop three over the course of the next five hours and headed out for number four. When you add Jasmin Paris in the womenâ€™s race, who was firmly in the mix, it made it a record-breaking 10 runners out on lap four.																					
But as all Barkley runners and fans know, starting four laps does not always guarantee a finish, and Gauduin, Ihara, and Herrero all dropped during this loop.																					
In rapid succession, between 45:46 and 46:19, some five men finished loop four, in order Kelly, Verys, Hamilton, Hall, and Campbell.																					
Verys returned to the course first, after about a 20-minute break, choosing the clockwise direction for his fifth and final lap. It was only a matter of minutes until all the other men trailed out, in opposite directions of each other.																					
After a small time gap, Raichon was the last to finish loop four, nabbing a time of 47:45:39. Dunn reported he took a wrong turn toward the end of the loop and had to go back out to correct it before receiving credit for the lap. With a quick turnaround in camp, Raichon made it back onto the course to start the fifth lap just three minutes before the cutoff to do so at 48 hours elapsed.																					
Including Paris in the womenâ€™s race, that made seven folks on the course for five laps, a record number of loop-five starters. A lot of anxious waiting among ultrarunning fans in Frozen Head State Park and the world over followed for the raceâ€™s final 12 hours.																					
With less than two hours on the clock, Ihor Verys was the first to touch the yellow gate in a time of 58:44:59. According to Dunn, he quipped, â€œMaybe you should add a sixth loop.â€																					
Now three-time Barkley finisher John Kelly came in shortly after in a time of 59:15:38. Jared Campbell finished a record fourth Barkley in 59:30:32, telling Laz afterward, â€œThat new section is brutal. You are a bad man.â€ Greig Hamilton also made it back to the finish under the 60-hour cutoff with a time of 59:38:42.																					
You can get to know some of the menâ€™s finishers viathis 2019 profile of Jared Campbellandthis entertaining race report by John Kelly of his first Barkley finish in 2017.																					
While Damian Hall and SÃ©bastien Raichon ultimately tapped out without completing their fifth lap, it was a huge year for â€œthe race that eats its young,â€ as it is called.

2024 Transgrancanaria Classic 126k Results: Courtney Dauwalter Repeats and Raul Butaci Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-transgrancanaria-classic-126k-results,"At the stroke of midnight, on Saturday, February 24, more than 750 runners set out for the 2024Transgrancanaria Classic 126k, the main event of the Transgrancanaria festival of races on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria off of the coast of Morocco.																					
Traveling 78.3 miles (126 kilometers) of mountainous terrain from Las Palmas on the northern tip of the island to the southern end in Maspalomas, the race route offers up more than 22,300 feet (6,800 meters) of elevation gain and is an early season classic that always draws big names in the trail running world. This year, the event was the third race in the World Trail Majors series.																					
All eyes were on last yearâ€™s returning womenâ€™s champion,Courtney Dauwalter(U.S.), who was coming back to racing after a big break following her massive 2023 race campaign. Also looking to vie for the top spot wasClaudia Tremps(Spain), who finished third in 2023 and 2022 and second in 2021.Azara GarcÃ­a(Spain) was also aiming to make a mark.																					
On the menâ€™s side, 2023 winnerAndreu Simon(Spain) was back, as wasMiguel ArsÃ©nio(Portugal), who was looking to improve on his 2023 second place.Raul Butaci(Romania, lives in Spain), who finished fourth in 2023, was also on the start line.Zach Miller(U.S.) arrived hoping for a strong showing in his Transgrancanaria debut.

The midnight start is a fairly unique feature for this race, and while runners started in dry conditions, it didnâ€™t take long for the weather to unleash. Strong winds, fog, cold temperatures, and ample precipitation continued in the dark before easing off to cloudy skies at daybreak. Good running weather conditions prevailed for the second half of the race as runners made their way across the southern reaches of the island.																					
While Dauwalter led the women from start to end in dominating fashion, finishing in 15:14:54, the menâ€™s race saw many lead changes and shakeups amongst the top five throughout the race. In the end, it would be Butaci with a strong mid-race move to come out on top in 13:22:32 ahead ofMiguel Heras(Spain) andIonel Manole(Romania, lives in Spain) in second and third places, respectively.																					
Itâ€™s hard to bet againstCourtney Dauwalter(U.S.)Â when it comes to race like Transgrancanaria. While last year, it took Dauwalter a little bit to work her way into the lead, this year she went straight to the front and opened up nearly a two-minute gap to the next woman within the first hour of the race. Donning a jacket as the weather deteriorated but still smiling through the wind, rain, and fog of the night, she moved efficiently through the check points and ran with the stride of a rested and happy runner enjoying a night out in the mountains.

By Fontanales, 42 kilometers in, Dauwalterâ€™s lead was nearly 15 minutes overAzara GarcÃ­a(Spain)Â and 21 minutes overClaudia Tremps(Spain).Emma Stuart(Ireland) ran in fourth just under half an hour back, andMaria Mercedes Pila(Ecuador, living in Spain) rounded out the top five. Positions in the top five stayed the same through Artenara at 65 kilometers with the coming of the day, with the gaps continuing to open with now a full hour between Dauwalter in the lead and Pila in fifth.																					
Things started to shake up for the women as they headed toward the course highpoint. At the GaraÃ±on checkpoint at 89 kilometers, Dauwalter led Tremps by 39 minutes after GarcÃ­a dropped from the race. Tremps and GarcÃ­a had left Tejeda (77k) together, but GarcÃ­a returned to the aid station with dizziness. Stuart moved into third, an hour back from the leader, andDominika Stelmach(Poland) ran in fourth, an hour and a half back from the charging Dauwalter.Anouk Baars(The Netherlands) rounded out the top five.																					
Over the high point and now under sunny skies, the gaps between the top women only increased as each settled into their paces on the long descent toward the finish. Courtney Dauwalter would finish in a time of 15:14 ahead of Claudia Tremps who came across the line in 16:27. Emma Stuart continued to run a strong and consistent race to round out the podium in 16:50 about an hour ahead of Dominika Stelmach, who took fourth in 17:49.

Leaving the start line in Las Palmas under a cloudy skies, it wasnâ€™t long before the favorites set a fast pace at the pointy end of the race. Going over several climbs on their way to the Fontanales checkpoint at kilometer 42, it wasZach Miller(U.S.),Miguel Heras(Spain), andMiguel ArsÃ©nio(Portugal) running within a minute of each other just over four hours into the race.																					
All seemed to be coping with the deteriorating weather well as rain and wind pelted the field and the fog closed in. All within six minutes of the lead,Ionel Manole(Romania, lives in Spain),Andreu Simon(Spain),Jia-Sheng Shen(China), andRaul Butaci(Romania, lives in Spain) stayed within close distance of the lead trio.

Reaching the middle of the course at Artenara at 65 kilometers and the start of the day high in the mountains of the island, little had changed in overall standings. ArsÃ©nio now led with a two-and-a-half minute lead over Miller and Heras while Butaci, showing his experience with on course, started to close the gap to third, now just 45 seconds off of a podium spot, while Manole and Simon stayed in close pursuit.																					
With daybreak came better weather for the field. Cloudy morning skies greeted racers as they started in on the southern half of the island traverse. Over the second highest point of the course and into the Tejeda checkpoint, Butaci made his move on the field. Now eight hours into the race, the Romanian put in a major surge to run himself into the lead alongside ArsÃ©nio, who would drop with a hamstring injury at 77 kilometers in Tejeda. Heras trailed under two minutes back while Miller seemed to be paying for his fast start, now nearly six minutes off of the lead.																					
Over GaraÃ±on, nearly at the high point of the race 89 kilometers in, ArsÃ©nio had dropped from the race and Butaci increased his lead over Heras to more than two minutes. Manole slotted into third position. Miller continued to fall back while a chasing trio of Simon, Shen, andAbel Carretero(Spain) all ran together to round out the top seven.																					
Starting the major descent out of the mountains, the men bombed down to Tunte at kilometer 101 with Butaci increasing his lead to more than five minutes over second. Nearly home at Ayagaures with only one smaller climb until the finish, the gap between first and second was nearly eight minutes. While Heras and Manole continued to hold onto second and third, Carretero made a huge move to work himself into fourth place and within striking distance of the podium if only he had more time. In the end, he would fall just 36 seconds short of a podium spot.																					
In the end, Raul Butaci took the win with a time of 13:22, Miguel Heras finished second in 13:32, and Ionel Manole took the final podium spot in 13:49. Abel Carretero finished in 13:49 and Jia-Sheng Shen rounded out the top five in 14:04:40. Former champion Andreu Simon held onto sixth position in 14:07, and Zach Miller finished seventh in 14:10.

2024 Tarawera by UTMB 102k Results: Kiwis Ruth Croft and Daniel Jones Take Home Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-tarawera-by-utmb-102k-results,"Many people who follow ultrarunning expectedRuth Croft(New Zealand) andDaniel Jones(New Zealand) to win theTarawera by UTMB 102kon Saturday, February 17, in New Zealand.																					
After all, the 2022 Western States 100 winner Croftâ€™s last race was a dominant win at the Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k this past November, and Jones, the defending champion, is coming off an impressive 2023 that included a 12th-place finish at UTMB and fifth-place finish at the Western States 100. Combine that with running your countryâ€™s biggest ultra and the extra attention that brings, and there was no shortage of pressure and expectation on the Kiwi duo.																					
But Croft and Jones seemed to thrive on it, as they both took home commanding wins in their respective races through the lush forests and cascading waterfalls of Rotorua, a city on New Zealandâ€™s North Island. It was both runnersâ€™ second wins at Tarawera, with Croft winning in 2021 and Jones victorious last year.																					
Starting under a morning fog, 726 runners began their way through the 63.5-mile course that featured more than 10,000 feet of elevation gain. The temperatures climbed as the race wore on even with decent cloud coverage, with many runners â€”Â Croft among them â€” using sponges soaked in cold water, among other techniques, to cool off.																					
Since its inception 15 years ago, the Tarawera 102k has attracted some of the sportâ€™s top talent and served as a bellwether of sorts for the upcoming ultra calendar. After Croft and Jonesâ€™ convincing wins, itâ€™s hard not to believe they are destined for another strong year.																					
Read on for the full race details.																					
[Editorâ€™s Note:This article was written by guest contributorRobbie Harms.]																					
Ruth Croftentered the first checkpoint at Lake Rotokakahi about 13.5 miles into the race in the lead and never looked back.Beth McKenzie(U.S., lives in Australia) was less than two minutes behind at that point, but Croftâ€™s lead grew steadily	 by the time they reached the first Millar Road checkpoint, at just over a marathon, she led by nearly five minutes, and by the time she got to Lake Tikitapu, it had grown to 11 minutes. McKenzie, an Ironman champion triathlete running in her first 100k, capped off a strong debut by finishing second.																				
[From 2016 to 2018, Beth McKenzie (nee Gerdes) served a two-year doping sanction after testing positive at the 2016 Ironman Australia for ostarine, a prohibited selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM).]																					
New Zealandâ€™sNikki Evertonwas the other runner in the mix, running in third consistently throughout the race. Everton improved her finish from last yearâ€™s race by 10 places to earn a spot on the podium.																					
This race belonged to Croft, though, and as she methodically built her lead it was up to her to simply keep her composure and not make any mistakes. She happily ran with young locals who sprinted next to her and enjoyed several cold-sponge showers at aid stations before crossing the finish line first for the second time in three years.																					
It wasSarah Ludowici(Australia) andKatie Wright(U.K., lives in New Zealand) who took fourth and fifth places in the womenâ€™s race.

Daniel Jones, too, led the race wire-to-wire. At the first checkpoint, he was three minutes ahead of ultimate sixth-place finisherMichael Dimuantes(Australia) before keeping his foot on the gas. He was focused and intentional at aid stations, methodically filling his bottles and cooling himself off to maintain his lead, which grew to double-digit minutes.																					
Justin Grunewald(U.S.) was his closest challenger all day, running a smart and strong race. He was in fifth at the first checkpoint but made it up to second by the Okataina checkpoint about 36 miles in, a place he wouldnâ€™t relinquish. Grunewald, who had two impressive third-place finishes at the Grindstone by UTMB 100k and the Canyons by UTMB 100k in 2023, finished about 40 minutes behind Jones.																					
Sage Canaday(U.S.) andMatthew Healy(South Africa) battled for the final podium spot. Canaday moved from seventh to third from miles 13 to 36 before Healy, who stayed in the top five the entire race, used a strong stretch from the second Millar Road checkpoint at mile 47 to Lake Tikitapu at mile 54 to move up two places to third, where he would remain until he crossed the finish line.

2024 Black Canyon 100k Results: Hayden Hawks Breaks Course Record and Rachel Drake Takes the Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-black-canyon-100k-results,"When the 2024Black Canyon 100kwas said and done,Hayden Hawksset a new menâ€™s course record,Rachel Draketook the win in the womenâ€™s race, six men and women took homeWestern States 100Golden Ticket entries, and all the eventâ€™s participants weathered some incredibly unique winter conditions in the Arizona desert. All in all, it was a big day for American trail ultrarunning.																					
The 2024 Black Canyon 100k took place on Saturday, February 10. After several weather delays, the race started at 9:30 a.m. local time.																					
The Black Canyon 100k is a point-to-point race that takes in 5,578 feet (1,700 meters) of elevation gain and 7,703 feet (2,348 meters) of descent. The race is held on the Black Canyon Trail, which is made up of singletrack, jeep roads, and an old stagecoach route.																					
The Black Canyon 100k is part of the newly formed World Trail Majors series and, importantly, a chance for elite runners to get their Golden Ticket entry to theWestern States 100. Three menâ€™s and three womenâ€™s Golden Tickets were up for grabs at this yearâ€™s race among the top finishers, so there was a lot to fight for.																					
Before the race had even begun, there was drama. Due to snowfall overnight, transport to the race was delayed, therefore the race was postponed. The race was also reduced from three to two waves to get everything underway as quickly as possible.																					
This could have impeded the athleteâ€™s nutritional strategies, and the disruption may have had a psychological impact on some. But what beauty there was to see snow in the desert, a rare occurrence!																					
Read on for the full race story.

It was an incredibly quick start to the race, with the menâ€™s top 20 sticking side by side up until the first aid station at Antelope Mesa, 7.6 miles in.Matthew Seideltook the lead, passing through the checkpoint at 49:28, followed byHayden Hawks,Bobby Peavey,Â andHans Troyer.																					
The top 10 men came through within 11 seconds of each other, so it was tight.																					
This continued through checkpoint three at Bumble Bee, 19.2 miles into the race, where Seidel, Troyer, and Hawks all passed through the checkpoint within one minute of each other.																					
It was at checkpoint four, Gloriana Mine around mile 24, that things started to heat up in the menâ€™s race. Hawks and Troyer were ahead, and both reached the checkpoint in 2:35, one minute in front of the rest of the competition.

Troyer, fresh out of college, managed to stay with veteran Hawks until Cottonwood Gulch where he dropped back and eventually went to fifth place by Table Mesa, just over 50 miles in. In the meantime, Hawks managed to hold pole position whilstChris MyersandJupiter Carera Casas(Mexico) moved up to fill the remaining podium positions.																					
As the race came to a close, it was less about who was going to win the race, but whether Hawks was going to set a new course record. Passing through Doe Springs with a little over three miles to go, he was going 34 seconds faster than the previous course record, 7:32:50,set byAnthony Costalesin 2023.																					
After coming back from knee surgery six months previous, and suffering a DNF at last yearâ€™s Western States 100, not only did Hawks finish in first place, but he also managed to bag a course record at 7:30:18.																					
He was followed by Jupiter Carera Casas in 7:39:56 for second, and Chris Myers in third place in 7:43:02, with the top three men accepting their Golden Ticket entries to the 2024 Western States 100.																					
Some later drama in the menâ€™s race occurred between ninth and 10th place, whenNate Jewkespipped Hans Troyer to the post with a sprint finish.

The womenâ€™s race was a game of strategy and started withHeather Jacksonleading the pack by one minute at checkpoint one, 7.6 miles in, coming in at 54:06.Rachel DrakeandAnna McKenna(Australia) followed shortly behind.																					
As the race went on, Jackson continued to widen the gap between her and her competitors. By the 12.8-mile mark, there was more than a two-minute gap between her and then second-placeSarah Biehl. The women in positions two to six were all close to one another.																					
Jackson held the lead through Black Canyon City, 37.7 miles in, but in the less than nine miles that followed to Cottonwood Gulch,Becca Windelland Drake had closed the gap and moved 16 minutes clear of Jackson, with Windell narrowly leading Drake through the checkpoint.																					
From here, Jackson dropped back, whilst Drake and Windell went head-to-head for the remaining miles. Windell had an incredible race, attacking from fifth place all the way up to third, then battling it out with Drake during the second half of the 100k.																					
But, the moment that Drake took the race was on the final river crossing. Both athletes were running together until this point, and it was only when they were exiting the river that Drake took the opportunity to drive ahead and take the lead. From there, it was her race.

2024 Hong Kong 100k Results: Lin Chen Storms Womenâ€™s Race While Guang-Fu Meng Takes Surprise Menâ€™s Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-hong-kong-100k-results,"The 2024Hong Kong 100kkicked off at 8 a.m. local time on Saturday, January 21, on the Sai Kung Peninsula, located on the east side of Hong Kong. This yearâ€™s womenâ€™s winner,LinChen(China), stormed through much of the race in first position, while the menâ€™s champion,Guang-Fu Meng(China), made a surprise attack on the last climb to finish in first position, knocking last yearâ€™s winner off the top spot.																					
This 103-kilometer (64 miles) race has over 5,300 meters of elevation gain (17,388 feet) and is one of three races that took place across the weekend â€” along with the half (56k/35 miles) and the third (33k/21 miles). Athletes can compete in individual races, or have the opportunity to compete in all three for a chance to win the eventâ€™s grand slam.																					
The Hong Kong 100k is also the first of nine races in the inaugural 2024 World Trail Majors series.																					
As expected, conditions were extremely humid throughout the race, which may have been a struggle for European athletes, who will currently be training through winter conditions back home. The womenâ€™s race began with an early lead from one of the favoritesDominika Stelmach(Poland), however it was Lin Chen who dominated the race and finished in 12:44:51.																					
In the menâ€™s race there was a shock finale from Guang-Fu Meng who overtookPei-Quan You(China) on the final climb of the race, and crossed the finish line in 10:16:56.

AlthoughDominika Stelmach(Poland) was ahead very early in the race, she came into the first checkpoint alongsideLinChen(China), and from there on it was Chenâ€™s race. With each passing kilometer, Chen increased the gap between her and the rest of the field.																					
Chen came into checkpoint six at Kei Ling Ha, 57 kilometers in, in 6:16:20, with 20 minutes between her andYing Li(China), who was by then in second place. These two were followed by Stelmach, who hit the checkpoint shortly afterward.																					
By checkpoint eight at Beacon Hill, 78k in, the gap between first and second had increased to 26 minutes, as Chen entered the checkpoint in 9:17:56. From there to the finish line, there was very little doubt that Chen had taken gold and was described as looking strong and composed throughout.																					
Lin Chen crossed the finish line in 12:44:51, taking first place in the womenâ€™s race. Chen also won the 2023 Doi Inthanon by UTMB 100 Mile in Thailand only a month ago, which is part of the Western States 100 Golden Ticket Series and at which she accepted that ticket. She also indicated after finishing the Hong Kong 100k that she plans to race UTMB this year.																					
Whilst Chen stormed the race, there was a shock retirement from Stelmach who dropped out of the race 11.5 hours in.																					
Ying Li maintained second place throughout the race, and although she wasnâ€™t able to close in on Chen, she crossed the finish line in second with a time of 13:39:30.																					
Unlike the top two positions, there was a lot more competition for third place.Ting Ma(China) retained third place for most of the second half of the race. But all the while,Yuan-Yuan Wu(China) was slowly creeping up the leaderboard, and there was a fierce battle between the two in the closing stages of the race, where they went head-to-head during the final climb.																					
However, it was Yuan-Yuan Wu who came out on top, and took third place in 13:54:08, running with her son across the finish line.

The competition was much closer in the menâ€™s race, with a shock win fromGuang-Fu Meng(China) at the very end of the race. This yearâ€™s favorite to win was last yearâ€™s winner and course record holderPei-Quan You(China). Even after this yearâ€™s race, his incredible 2020 record still stands at 10:00:17.																					
From the offset, You took the lead and from checkpoint three at 34k onward, Meng dipped between second and third place. By checkpoint eight, 78k in, the gap had increased, with You taking a 12-minute lead on Meng, and still looking very comfortable in pole position.																					
However, it was the final checkpoint where the competition started to heat up. With 10k to go, there was only a five-minute gap between the competitors, and although it looked like You still had the race in the bag, Meng did the impossible. He managed to overtake on the final uphill to the highest peak of the race â€” and of Hong Kong â€” Tai Mo Shan.																					
Guang-Fu Meng took first place in the menâ€™s race, finishing in 10:16:56, and Pei-Quan You took second in 10:35:11.																					
Tyler Greenfrom the U.S. also had a strong race, climbing from 12th to third place by the 70k mark. From here on, he managed to maintain his position and finished the race in 10:38:12, only minutes behind You.

2024 Winter Spine Race Results: Jack Scott Shatters Course Record, Claire Bannwarth Claims Second Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-winter-spine-race-results,"The 2024Spine Racewas one for the record books, withJack Scott(U.K.) taking redemption for his narrow defeat toDamian Hall(U.K.) in last yearâ€™s race, by claiming a decisive win and a new course record. Scottâ€™s time of 72 hours, 55 minutes, and 5 seconds carved 10 hours, 17 minutes, and 18 seconds offJasmin Parisâ€™shistoric 2019 overall course record.																					
Claire Bannwarth(France) became the first woman in Spine Race history to secure back-to-back wins at the race, and her 92-hour, 2-minute, and 23-second victory also took more than 5 hours off of her winning time from 2023.																					
The 268-mile race runs the length of the Pennine Way in England, from south to north, finishing in Kirk Yetholm on the Scottish border. It takes racers through some of the most remote parts of the country, in invariably brutal conditions.																					
Conditions for this yearâ€™s race were bright and clear for the first part of the week, but bitterly cold, with a diversion forced due to extreme ice on the course. In the second half of the week, the blue skies gave way to heavy snowfall.																					
Read on to see the full breakdown of the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s races.

Spine Race enthusiasts will recall that the 2022 menâ€™s race began with a duo ofKim Collison(U.K.) andDamian Hall(U.K.) pushing the pace hard at the front of the race, before both unfortunately succumbed to injury and were forced to withdraw.																					
This yearâ€™s race started in a somewhat similar vein, with Collison taking up the lead from early on. Through the first checkpoint, 44 miles in, the top three were Collison,Konrad Rawlik(Poland, lives in U.K.), andDave Phillips(U.K.), with the chasing pack not far behind.

The first shock of the race came when former menâ€™s course record holder andBarkley Marathonsfinisher,John Kelly(U.S.), retired at CP1, just 9 hours and 27 minutes into his Spine Race journey, due to injury. Over the duration of the first night, the attritional course also claimed strong contendersPavel Paloncy(Czech Republic) andSimon Roberts(U.K.).																					
By the second checkpoint at Hawes, 103 miles in, Collison was still in the lead, with 23 hours and 41 minutes on the clock. Hall and Rawlik followed in second and third, about 15 minutes back. Eventual championJack Scott(U.K.) came through this point withJames Nobles(U.K.), relaxed in joint fourth position, 40 minutes back of the lead.																					
The end of the second day saw further disruption when, reminiscent of 2022, race leader Collison was forced to retire at CP3 Langdon, 143 miles into the race, leaving Hall to take up the lead.																					
But before the next checkpoint, the race began to mirror last yearâ€™s, as Scott caught up with Hall before mile 156, with the pair sharing some of the trail before Scott pulled away.																					
Coming into CP4 Alston, around mile 175, with a lead of almost an hour, Scott was fully in race mode â€” reportedly in and out of the checkpoint â€œin F1 fashionâ€ and with â€œrazor sharp focus.â€																					
For the near-100 miles that followed, Scott continued to put more distance on Hall â€” but also, move further ahead of both Jasmin Parisâ€™s overall course record, and Hallâ€™s menâ€™s course record of 84 hours, 36 minutes, and 24 seconds.																					
After 268 miles, Jack Scott touched the wall in Kirk Yetholm with 72:55:05 on the clock. Damian Hall followed in second, in a personal best time of 82:25:10, also under both previous course records. Konrad Rawlik rounded out the menâ€™s podium in 85:47:12.

There were fewer attritions at the sharp end of the womenâ€™s race, with eventual winnerClaire Bannwarth(France) asserting her dominance early on.																					
At CP1 Hebden, 44 miles in, Bannwarth had already established herself in front, with 10 hours and 56 minutes elapsed. Bannwarth, who won last yearâ€™s Winter Spine Race, went on to have a superb 2023 â€” winning amongst others theTrailcat 200 Mile, theKodiak Ultramarathon by UTMB 100 Mile, and theTahoe 200 Mile, as well as placing fifth at theHardrock 100and 16th atUTMB.																					
Hannah Rickman(U.K.), who placed second behind Bannwarth at last yearâ€™s Winter Spine Race, and won the 2023 Summer Spine Sprint (on a 46-mile section of the route), followed in second, about 19 minutes back of the lead.

Elaine Bisson(U.K.) entered the checkpoint in third place, just 6 minutes behind Rickman, but took some time to recoup and prepare for the next section.Lucy Gossage(U.K.) was in next, and made a swift turnaround in the checkpoint to emerge in third position, with fell running legendNicky Spinksamong the chasing pack. Crossover athlete Gossage previously competed in triathlon before transitioning to ultrarunning, and has many Ironman victories to her name.																					
While Bannwarth continued to pull away in front, by CP3 Langdon, Gossage had moved into second position by a margin of 51 minutes.

Rickman, however, was later awarded a 1-hour and 46-minute time bonus for a Good Samaritan act. She and another runner (G Brian Hutchinson, who was 10th in the menâ€™s race) reportedly delayed their race to assist a fellow competitor who was suffering from fatigue along on a challenging part of the route, and escorted him to safety.																					
By CP 5 Bellingham, Bannwarth was now almost 7 hours clear of Gossage in second, who now also had a sizeable lead â€” of more than 5 hours â€” on Rickman in third.																					
Bannwarth eventually touched the wall, victorious, in a time of 92 hours, 2 minutes, and 23 seconds â€” taking 5 hours and 37 minutes off her previous winning time.																					
Rickman truly rallied in the later stages of the race, closing in on Gossage. Gossage crossed the line before her, in a time of 106 hours, 5 minutes, and 26 seconds â€” but the time bonus meant that Rickman was awarded second place in a time of 104:41:46. The close battle and dynamic race for second place made for nail-biting dot-watching, even if Bannwarthâ€™s victory was never in doubt.

2024 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-hardrock-100-lottery-results,"Congratulations to all the runners who secured places in the 2024Hardrock 100!																					
The Hardrock 100 is a 100-mile race through Coloradoâ€™s San Juan Mountains, starting and finishing in Silverton. The challenging and gorgeous route packs in 33,000 feet of elevation, often at altitudes above 13,000 feet. It alternates direction each year, and will run clockwise in 2024.																					
The ultimate bucket list race, the Hardrock 100 is notoriously difficult to gain entry into, with 2,796 applying for this yearâ€™s lottery alone. Unlike the Western States 100, which offers several avenues to gain entry in addition to an even more difficult lotto, the only way to secure a guaranteed entry into the Hardrock 100 is to win the previous yearâ€™s race. The 2024 Hardrock 100 will start 146 runners.																					
Below, we list top competitors on the current entrants list as well as those high enough on the waitlists to have a chance of getting in. Then, we explain how the lottery operates, as well as break down some of the demographics of this yearâ€™s lottery and its lucky selected runners.

The 2024 lottery is divided into two categories, the Never Finished and Finished divisions:																					
For 2024, 73 runners were selected from each category.																					
From 2022 onward, the Hardrock 100 organization adopted a new policy whereby the same proportion of female runners who enter the lottery will be selected to run the race. Therefore, the draw is essentially drawn into four sections: Female Never, Female Finished, Male Never, and Male Finished.																					
Returning champions are given automatic entrance to the event. The 2023 womenâ€™s champion Courtney Dauwalter has accepted that entry, while 2023 menâ€™s champAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallazdeclined it.																					
Each year, race directorDale Garlandalso handpicks six entrants who bypass the lottery. Explained on the organizationâ€™s website, â€œIn 2024, six such runners will be selected, evenly split between men and women, from a slate of at least 12 applicants proposed by the RD and approved by the Hardrock Board of Directors.â€ In prior years, the names of these picks were kept confidential. For Hardrock 2024, the organization is releasing those names. This year, those runners were:

2023 IAU 24-Hour World Championships Results: Womenâ€™s World Record for Miho Nakata, Alexander Sorokin Repeats Menâ€™s Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-iau-24-hour-world-championships-results,"At the 2023IAU 24-Hour World Championshipsin Taipei,Miho Nakata(Japan)Â set anew womenâ€™s world recordandAleksandr Sorokin(Lithuania) repeated his win from 2019. Nakata covered a distance of 167.996 miles (270.363 kilometers) and Sorokin ran 187.530 miles (301.800 kilometers).																					
This yearâ€™s race, held on a 1.24-mile (2 kilometers) loop, took place on Friday and Saturday, December 1 and 2, and kicked off at 10 a.m. local time on Friday.																					
The IAU 24-Hour World Championships are one of the biggest events in ultrarunning and havenâ€™t been held since 2019 due to COVID-19 restrictions. Unlike many other races, athletes are not only competing as individuals but are also working to score points as a team for their countryâ€™s team rankings.																					
In the womenâ€™s race, expectations were high for the last editionâ€™s winner and 24-hour record holderCamille Herron(United States), but in the end it was Nakata who stole the show and broke Herronâ€™s world record by a super-slim margin of 807 feet (246 meters), what amounts to a little over half a lap of a track.																					
In the menâ€™s race, as predicted by many, Sorokin emerged as champion after creating a large gap between himself and the rest of the field. While Sorokin was aiming to also set a world record, he wasnâ€™t able to maintain the requisite pace in the last 5 or so hours, though he still finished first by a wide margin.																					
We dive deeper into the race below.

As expected, the top athletes remained close to one another in the early couple hours of the race, and then things began to string out. By some five hours in, Herron, the 2019 champion and world-record holder, sat in third place, two minutes back from the lead, while eventual championMiho Nakata(Japan) was already leading.																					
At the halfway point, the womenâ€™s podium positions were composed of Nakata, Herron, andLine Caliskaner(Norway). Some 16 hours in, Nakata continued to build her lead, but second and third places shuffled, withCarmen Maria Perez(Spain) andNoora Honkala(Finland) now in those spots.																					
One of the biggest shocks of the womenâ€™s race came when Herron withdrew at about 88 miles (142k), just under 12 hours into the event. Only nine weeks prior, Herron won and broke the course record at the Spartathlon in Greece and said on social media after withdrawing that she didnâ€™t feel fully recovered from that effort.																					
Change came again at the 21-hour mark behind leader Nakata, whereOlena Shevchenko(Ukraine) had now moved up to second place and Perez down to third place.																					
As the race progressed, all eyes were on Nakata, who was on track for breaking the world record, but the question was if sheâ€™d be able to hold pace through the finish. She needed every last second of those 24 hours to get the job done, surpassing the prior world record by a short distance. Read more about Nakataâ€™s world record in ournews article.																					
Shevchenko finished second with more than 157 miles (254k) andPatrycja Bereznowska(Poland) moved up late to round out the womenâ€™s podium. She finished with more than 154 miles (248.8k).																					
In the womenâ€™s team race, Poland won, Japan took second, and the Czech Republic was third.																					
Provisional results.																					
Last yearâ€™s winner and current 24-hour world-record holderAleksandr Sorokin(Lithuania) was the heavy favorite, but did not go out as aggressively as the early frontrunners. It was almost six hours before Sorokin took the lead, and at the 12-hour mark, he was just short of his world record pace.																					
Whilst Sorokin increased his gap on the field to 7.4 miles (12k) at the 16-hour mark,Fotios Zisimopoulos(Greece) ledAndrii Tkachuk(Ukraine) in a still close race for second and third place. Interestingly, while the womenâ€™s race for the podium shifted numerous times, this would be the menâ€™s ultimate podium.																					
With five hours left to race, the world record was out of Sorokinâ€™s reach, but he was plenty strong enough to maintain that large gap.																					
With four hours left to race,Francisco Mariano Martinez(Spain) sat at 150.3 miles (242k) in fourth place, challenging for the podium.																					
After 24 hours, Sorokin finished with 187.530 miles (301.800k), well off his previous world record of 198.598 miles (319.614k). Zisimopoulos finished second with about 181 miles (292k) and Tkachuk finished third with about 176 miles (284k).

2023 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k Results: Mityaev and Croft Dominate the South African Race,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-ultra-trail-cape-town-100k-results,"After a day of fierce heat and competition, the 2023Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100kcrownedDmitry Mityaev(Russia) andRuth Croft(New Zealand) as this yearâ€™s champions.																					
The race started at 6 a.m. local time in Cape Town, South Africa, on Saturday, November 25. The 98-kilometer (61 miles) race is one of several that took place during the weekend festival. It is unique in its landscape, with mountains, beaches, and cityscapes throughout the ultra. The race began at Gardens Rugby Football Club and covered 4,972 meters (16,312 feet) of elevation gain. The route is front loaded in its climbing, with 1,700 meters of gain in the first 25k, scaling Table Mountain and Suther Peak.																					
Race day was a hot one, with athletes drinking as much water as possible on route and at the checkpoints. At the checkpoints, race crews poured ice cubes in athletesâ€™ packs and placed socks filled with ice across their necks to stop the athleteâ€™s body temperature from rising in the midday heat.																					
The race was set to be an exciting one, with last yearâ€™s menâ€™s champion Mityaev returning to compete against favorites such asThibaut Baronian(France).																					
Unfortunately,Tom Evans(U.K.), one of the menâ€™s favorites, was missing from the start line after being held at knifepoint in Cape Town while training for the race. However, that didnâ€™t stop him from cheering his Adidas Terrex teammates during the event.																					
The womenâ€™s race appeared to be just as dramatic, withMarianne Hogan(Canada) competing in her second go at this event, after having taken second two years ago. However, she was a bit of a wild card given sheâ€™s been returning from injury. All things told, international superstar Croft was probably the womenâ€™s favorite.																					
Read on for the full race story.

Dmitry Mityaevâ€™s(Russia) running career has gone from strength to strength in recent years, after running the fastest time ever in the mountain race at Mount Elbrus and winning this event last year, he was always going to be one of the strongest contenders. Right from the beginning Mityaev dominated, staying at the front of the pack up to the first checkpoint until he decided to break away and run alone for the rest of the race, and he never stopped.																					
Between Table Mountain at 31k and Llandudno 41k, it appeared that Mityaev had taken a fall with a nasty gash on his left thigh. This was followed by a wrong turn after hopping from the roads and onto trails just before the Llandudno checkpoint. He could be forgiven because the rugged trail looked more like someoneâ€™s back garden than a running route. Needless to say, none of these setbacks stopped him and Mityaev came through the finish line at 10:43:06, 19 minutes ahead of his next opponent.																					
Whilst Mityaev took the lead, competition was heating up between second, third, and fourth places.Caleb Olson(U.S.) andThibaut Baronian(France) were 10 minutes behind Mityaev coming into the checkpoint at Llandudno, followed closely byAnthony Costales(U.S.) andDarren Thomas(U.S.). Although as predicted Olson came in second at Hout Bay checkpoint at 57k, Baronian dropped back to fifth place behind and seemed to be dipping. However, Baronian managed to climb back up to fourth position for the remainder of the race until he crossed the finish line. Thomas would lose ground later, easing back to finish 10th.																					
Whilst Mityaev crossed the line in first, the gaps grew larger between the rest of the competitors toward the end of the race. Americans filled the rest of the menâ€™s podium, with Olson placing second at 11:02:28, followed by Costales in 11:24:08.

This yearâ€™s winner wasRuth Croft(New Zealand), also the 2022 Western States 100 champion. To win this race, Croft put in an incredible effort and dominated the womenâ€™s race throughout the course. She began head-to-head withMarianne Hogan(Canada), but after the fourth checkpoint at Table Mountain, 31k into the race, the gap began to increase between the two athletes.																					
By checkpoint five at Llandudno, just 10k later, Croft had increased her lead by nine minutes and passed through at 4:55, just a few minutes behindBeth Pascallâ€™scourse record pace. However, since Pascallâ€™s record, the course has changed, making it harder to compare the course times. As the race progressed, Croft became an even stronger athlete and increased her lead.																					
Whilst Croft appeared to be running her own race at the front, the competition was fierce between Hogan andEkaterina Mityaeva(Russia) for second and third place. At Table Mountain there was a widening gap, with Hogan seemingly taking the lead. This was promising for an athlete who was recovering from injury and matching similar times from her performance at this event in 2021 when she placed second. But during the latter half of the race, Hogan took a fall on a gravel sidewalk, and after this she was passed by Mityaeva who moved in to second place.																					
Whilst the battle continued for second and third, Croft crossed the finish line to win in 12:12:20. Hogan managed to push back and finished in second place at 12:39:53, followed by Mityaeva in third in a very close 12:44:07. In doing so, Mityaeva improved upon her fourth-place finish at the race last year.

2023 Big Dogâ€™s Backyard Ultra Results: Harvey Lewis Wins After 108 Hours, 450 Miles of Running,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-big-dogs-backyard-ultra-results,"Runners continue to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in backyard ultrarunning, and the 2023Big Dogâ€™s Backyard Ultrawas no different. In the end, AmericanHarvey Lewisclaimed the title of last person standing, after a record-breaking 108 hours and 450 miles of running.																					
Weâ€™ve now published anin-depth interviewwith Harvey Lewis.

The race, which acts as the world championships of backyard ultrarunning, started at 7 a.m. local time on Saturday, October 21, in Bell Buckle, Tennessee. The format sees racers run a 4.166667-mile loop, called a â€œyardâ€ in backyard ultrarunning, within a one-hour time limit, after which all finishers within the allotted time are tied for first place, and must present on the start line on the hour to go again. This continues until there is only one runner left standing, who must complete a solo yard to be awarded the win.																					
In this particular event, athletes run two routes â€” a trail loop, which is run during the daylight hours, and a road loop, which the race switches over to at night.																					
Remarkably, on Wednesday, October 25, a total of six runners passed the once seemingly insurmountable barrier of 100 hours. This group included 2021 Big Dogâ€™s Backyard Ultra winner,Harvey Lewis(U.S.)	 former joint backyard ultra world record holder,Merijn Geerts(Belgium)	 and most recent backyard ultra world record holder,Phil Gore(Australia).																			
Over the course of the 101st yard, Geerts was timed out. Gore, along with Japanâ€™sTerumichi Morishita, finished their 100th lap but failed to present themselves on the start on the next hour with the will to go again.																					
And then there were three.																					
Still standing after 101 hours were Harvey Lewis,Ihor Verys(Ukraine, lives in Canada), and Polandâ€™sBartosz Fudali. With Goreâ€™s world record of 102 yards, which he set in June of 2023 at the Dead Cow Gully Backyard Ultra in his home country, all each of these three needed to do was finish out the lap to become joint world record holders. After that, the race would go into new and uncertain territory.

Of the three still in the race, Fudali had been running the fastest, completing the loops in an average time of 46 minutes, 51 seconds. Lewis was running slowest, averaging 52:23.																					
Race directorGary Cantrell, akaLaz, noted on social media that: â€œHarvey Lewis looks to be the most endangered on an immediate basis, he runs the closest to the cutoff and sometimes seems to be struggling â€¦.â€ He added, â€œNone of that is any different than it was at the beginning of the race. About 50 runners that looked better than Harvey are watching from the sidelines.â€																					
All three runners made it through loops 102 and 103, jointly resetting the backyard ultra world record.																					
But, in a surprising plot twist, Fudali refused to start the 104th yard, leaving two left in the race â€” Verys and Lewis.

Yards 104 to 106 progressed, with Verys finishing each of them around five minutes faster than Lewis, giving himself a few extra minutes of recuperation before the next loop began. On loop 107, it was Lewis who finished a couple minutes ahead of Verys. Yard 108 ushered in sunset on the runnersâ€™ fifth day of running, and they switched over the nighttime road loop.																					
During loop 108, Ihor Verys returned to the start/finish line, choosing to not complete the loop and drop from the race. Harvey Lewis successfully completed yard 108, becoming the last person standing. Verys is credited with the assist on Lewisâ€™s win.

Among the small but stout contingent of women racers,Claire Bannwarth(France) was the last woman standing. Prolific ultrarunner Bannwarth won the 2023 Montane Spine Race, and also in 2023 reset her own French womenâ€™s backyard ultra record to 48 yards. These past few days, she added another 12 hours to that total, running 250 miles over 60 hours before she was ultimately timed out.

Another national womenâ€™s record holder, Canadaâ€™sAmanda Nelson, was the second-to-last woman standing, running 57 yards and adding one yard to her own personal best and her Canadian national record.																					
Current womenâ€™s backyard ultra world record holder,Jennifer Russo(U.S.), was timed out after 53 laps. Fifty-seven-year-old Russo ran 311 miles over 74 hours at the Capital Backyard Ultra in June of 2023, breakingCourtney Dauwalterâ€™sworld best for women of 68 yards.																					
The backyard ultra format has been growing steadily in popularity since its inception in 2011 â€” and received a further boost by the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel and more traditional races were unfeasible â€” and along with this popularity have come mind-boggling achievements.																					
Some 60 hours into this yearâ€™s Big Dogâ€™s Backyard Ultra, race director Gary Cantrell posted on social media: â€œIn 2019 the winner of Bigâ€™s did 60 yards. Right now we have 31 people out on the 60th yard. I think that is what they mean by exponential growth.â€

2023 Diagonale des Fous Results: Commanding Wins by Schide and Dunand-Pallaz,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-diagonale-des-fous-results,"The 2023Diagonale des Fous, or â€œDiagonal of Fools,â€ kicked off at 9 p.m. local time in Saint Pierre, on the south coast of RÃ©union Island, a French department in the Indian Ocean, on Thursday, October 19.																					
The unique 165-kilometer (102 miles) traverse, the longest race in the weekend-longGrand Raid RÃ©unionfestival, begins on the south side of the island with a partial ascent of active volcano, Piton de La Fournaise, and follows a spectacular route through UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the lands of RÃ©union National Park to finish on the north coast in the capital city of Saint-Denis. The race takes in roughly 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) of climbing and as much descending, on brutally technical terrain, and is seen as one of the most difficult 100 milers on the global race calendar.																					
This yearâ€™s race had a promising line-up, includingUTMBâ€™s2022 winner,Katie Schide, and 2023 third-place manGermain Grangier. Fans were also thrilled with a surprising late addition â€” four-time Diagonale des Fous winnerFranÃ§oisDâ€™Haene, who has been absent from the scene for a time due to injury and was spotted on the start line sporting a hand-written bib.																					
While womenâ€™s favorite Schide did not disappoint, with a commanding win over strong rivals including Franceâ€™sCamille Bruyas	 it was 2023Hardrock 100championAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallazwho came out on top in the menâ€™s race, with a similar runaway victory to what we saw from him at Hardrock.																				
Read on to see how both these races played out.																					
Katie Schidehas had two high profile second-place finishes this season â€” at theWestern States 100, where the American living in France finished in the second fastest womenâ€™s time ever on the historic route, and atOCC, where she demonstrated her versatility by stepping down a distance and still competing at the highest level. At Diagonale des Fous, it was clear from the start that she would be hard to beat â€” leading from the get-go, and always with a comfortable gap on 2022 Les Templiers winner,Camille Bruyas, of France, in second.																					
Schide took it out hard from the first climb, and by Notre Dame De La Paix at 28k, already had an 18-minute lead on Bruyas. She gained even more ground on the second leg of the climb up to the raceâ€™s high point, CroisÃ©e Coteaux Kerveguen at 63.5k, where she topped out 29 minutes ahead of her chaser. Past the 100k point at Ilet Ã€ Bourse, she had stretched her lead further to an hour and 12 minutes, at this point looking impossible to catch.																					
While Schide was out on her own for almost the entirety of the race, so too was Bruyas, who always had a big gap on the rest of the field and never looked to be in danger. Summiting CroisÃ©e Coteaux Kerveguen at 63.5k, she was 23 minutes clear of RÃ©union Islandâ€™s ownEmilie Maroteauxin third. It was a closer battle for third position, with Germanyâ€™sEva-Maria Spergerfollowing hot on Maroteauxâ€™s heels, just two minutes behind at that point.																					
Schide continued her tour de force for the remaining 60k or so of the race â€” which had fewer big climbs, but covered ankle-breaking volcanic terrain â€” and ultimately finished in 27:31:08, an hour and 26 minutes clear of Bruyas in second. Bruyas finished with an even bigger lead on Maroteaux in third. After some close running and trading of places with Sperger earlier in the race, Maroteaux managed to pull away, securing the final podium position and the first local home in the womenâ€™s race with another big margin.

Early on in his career, in 2012, FrenchmanAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallazran the 73k race at Grand Raid RÃ©union, placing fourth. Was a seed planted then to come back eventually and take on the 100-mile win? Who knows, but he started this race like someone on a mission. By Notre Dame De La Paix â€” 28k into the race with just over 1,600 meters climbed â€” he was just over a minute ahead of then second-place, Franceâ€™sGermain Grangier, but was not giving up his marginal lead. Reaching Coteaux Kerveguen at 61k â€” just before cresting the raceâ€™s high point at roughly 2,500 meters â€” Dunand-Pallaz had pulled 12 minutes clear of the rest of the field, with his countrymanLambert Santellithen following in second.																					
Last yearâ€™s second-place man, Switzerlandâ€™sJean-Philippe Tschumiâ€” after moving around in the top 10 for the first half of the race â€” crept up the field to second place after 85k. He came close enough to make Dunand-Pallaz sweat, running just three minutes back of the leader around the 100k mark.																					
Tschumi held on to second for a long time, but Dunand-Pallaz reasserted his dominance, and had pulled more than a half hour clear of his chaser by Deux Bras at 128k, with most of the climbing done.																					
It was here too that Grangier made a move into second position. Like Tschumi, Grangier had been moving around the top 10 for the raceâ€™s first half, before settling into third position from 92k onward. It was on the second-to-last climb up to Dos Dâ€™ane where he finally got ahead of Tschumi.																					
Dunand-Pallaz continued to power ahead, ultimately finishing in 23 hours and 21 minutes, 39 minutes clear of Grangier in second. Tschumi followed in 24:28 for third, with Grangier having put significant time on him in the raceâ€™s closing section.																					
Grand Raid legend, FrenchmanFranÃ§oisDâ€™Haenemay or may not be back to full race fitness. He was briefly in podium position around the halfway point but fell back a little to ultimately finish in eighth place. Mid-race, his social media channels indicated that he was suffering from leg cramps. We hope this is only the start of his comeback.

2023 Pikes Peak Ascent Results: Bonnet Breaks Record, Laukli Leads Women,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-pikes-peak-ascent-results-remi-bonnet-breaks-matt-carpenter-record,"Oww, oww,RÃ©mi Bonnetdid it!																					
Bonnet ran 2:00:20 to become the fastest ever up 14,115-foot Pikes Peak.																					
The record happened as part of the 2023Pikes Peak Ascenton September 16. The race started in the town of Manitou Springs, Colorado, and climbed 7,800 feet over an average 11% grade toward the high altitude finish on the mountain summit. The final three miles are all above treeline, and there was snow on the higher stretches this year.																					
In the womenâ€™s race, OlympianSophia Lauklicontinues to dominate womenâ€™s mountain running, in this case running away from the rest of the field to finish about 3.5 minutes ahead of everyone else.																					
Read on for the full race story.																					
RÃ©mi Bonnetwon last yearâ€™s race in 2:07:02, and so his run this year was significantly faster than his former best. The previous best wasMatt Carpenterâ€™s2:01:06, run as part of the roundtrip Pikes Peak Marathon race in 1993. Carpenterâ€™s full Marathon time that year was 3:16:39. That 1993 performance has been widely regarded as one of the stoutest records in mountain running.																					
This yearâ€™s race was part of the Golden Trail World Series, and Bonnet earned a $3,000 first-place prize, but just missed a $10,000 time bonus for going under two hours.																					
Bonnet has made his mark as an uphill ace in recent years and in the week leading up to the race, reset his own fastest known time on the Manitou Springs Incline, a mile-long, stair-stepped, 2,000-foot climb. This was his first race back after dropping from Augustâ€™s Sierre-Zinal event in Switzerland.																					
Patrick Kipngeno(Kenya), the two-time World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race winner, was second in 2:04:09, and thatâ€™s the third-best time ever up the mountain. Kipngeno trails only Bonnet and Carpenter on the all-time charts.																					
Top AmericanEli Hemmingmoved up one place from a year ago and was third in 2:07:40. Two-time Pikes Peak Marathon winnerSeth Demooradded the Ascent as part of a double and was fourth in 2:09:47.

2023 UTMB Results: Dauwalter and Walmsley Lead American Sweep,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-utmb-results,"The 2023UTMBwas filled with question marks about who would end up standing on the top step of the podium, both for the men and women.																					
On the womenâ€™s side, only a handful of the top 10 from the 2022 race were returning. If one were to ignore everything thatCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had previously done this summer, she would have been the odds-on favorite. But just seven weeks removed from setting a new course record at the Hardrock 100, which was just three weeks after doing the same at the Western States 100, no one knew how her seemingly super-human body and mind would hold up.																					
But really, in hindsight, it was silly for anyone to worry about how the G.O.A.T. of trail ultrarunning would handle a third 100-mile race of her summer. Dauwalter once again showed that she is in a league of her own, leading the race from 32 kilometers in and never looking back. Her runaway victory resulted in a time of 23:29:14.																					
For the men, with nine out of the top 10 men from 2022 returning, the depth of the field was unquestionable. And with Kilian Jornet out due to injury, it was anyoneâ€™s race.																					
But, truth be told, most eyes were probably trained onJim Walmsley(post-race interview). After his second summer spent in Europe with a full focus placed on UTMB, would he finally be able to put together the race that everyone thought that he could? Would there finally be an American man who would crack the code of UTMB? It it wasnâ€™t going to be Walmsley, could it beZach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) instead?																					
For much of the race, it would have been difficult to discern which of the two Americans, or really any of the men running in the top 10, would come away with the victory as the lead changed hands multiple times and the gaps grew into the double-digit minutes on multiple occasions. But it in the end, it was Walmsley, the meticulous student of UTMB, who would finally be able to put all the pieces together and reach Chamonix first with a time of 19:37:43, a new course record. He becomes the first American man to win this iconic European race.																					
At 172 kilometers (106.5 miles) in length and with some 10,000 meters (32,800) feet of climbing, the UTMB circles Mont Blanc in the Alps on one is arguably the most iconic course in trail ultrarunning. With a start in Chamonix, France, the final race at the end of a week of all things trail running and racing, the course leaves town and climbs quickly into the mountains into France, Italy, and then onto Switzerland before returning to Chamonix to the biggest finish line in the sport.																					
Itâ€™s fair to say that this is the most competitive trail ultramarathon of the year, and the event serves up all the excitement that is expected of it. With its high level of prestige as the grand finale of the UTMB Mont Blanc festival, huge crowds come to watch the greats of the sport race over the rugged and wild course where anything can, and does, happen.

This year, 2,814 starters headed out from Chamonix at 6 p.m. on Friday, September 1, 2023, on a slightly modified course. Late in August, race organizers announced a change in the final segment of the race that added just under two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) to the overall distance but replaced a steep climb and technical descent with much gentler forest running, albeit still a climb. While this change suited some runners and was a disadvantage to others, in the end, it probably made very little difference in the outcome of any of the placings in the race.																					
A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of UTMB possible!

Was there actually any doubt that AmericanCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) would actually win UTMB? If her performances throughout the summer were any indication, it would have been foolish to bet against her. After winning and setting course records at both Western States 100 and Hardrock 100 earlier this summer, this win might just be the cherry on the cake, or thecerise sur le gateau, as the French would have it.																					
The legend of the sport led from the early miles, and in typical Courtney fashion, seemed to smile and joke her way to the win with a time of 23:29:14. But the win didnâ€™t come as easy as it may have seemed to people watching. While she continued to put on a smile for race volunteers and spectators, Dauwalter was deep in the pain cave after about 110 kilometers, sometimes wondering if her legs would actually keep her moving forward, all of the miles from earlier in the summer catching up to her. But luckily, she had just enough left in her to get her to Chamonix and the roar of the massive crowds.

WhileEmma Pooley, of Switzerland, led for the initial kilometers of the race, it didnâ€™t take long for Dauwalter to move to the front. Sporting her trademark smile and happily interacting with volunteers at aid stations whenever the opportunity presented itself, Dauwalter simply makes it look good.																					
The top three women, Dauwalter, Pooley, and Franceâ€™sBlandine Lâ€™Hirondel(post-race interview), came intoLes Contamines, 32 kilometers into the race, within seconds of each other. It would be the last time we would see the front of the race together, as byCol du Bonhomme,12 kilometers later, the gap between Dauwalter and second-placeManon BohardCailler, of France, was nearly 10 minutes. Lâ€™Hirondel and Chiinaâ€™sFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-race interview) came through another two minutes later. Germanyâ€™sKatharina Hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) came over the dark col another five minutes in arrears. The situation remained essentially unchanged through Les Chapieux at 51 kilometers and Lac Combal at 69 kilometers, except the gaps were growing.																					
Nearly 10 hours into the race, Dauwalter came throughCourmayeur at 81 kilometers, not even bothering to stop at the aid station. Bohard continued to keep the gap manageable at 18 minutes, but it was really starting to look like another runaway victory for the American for the top step of the podium. But the race for the rest of the top spots was just starting to get interesting. Lâ€™Hirondel and Xiang remained close in third and fourth, just a few minutes back of Bohard, and Hartmuth continued to lurk another 20 minutes back. This early in the race, there were still many within striking distance.

Coming throughRefuge Bertone at 86 kilometers, the top five remained unchanged and Canadaâ€™sAilsa McDonald, Polandâ€™sKatarzyna SoliÅ„ska, the U.S.â€™sSabrina StanleyandLeah Yingling, andClaudia Trempsof Spain filled out the top 10.																					
Somewhere beforeArnouvaz at kilometer 99, Bohard took a fall that would ultimately take her out of the race. She entered the aid station walking gingerly, but was determined to keep going. This development opened up podium possibilities even further, and Xiang and Lâ€™Hirondel continued to run together at Grand Col Ferret, 50 minutes behind the ever-steady, smiling, and happy Dauwalter. Hartmuth was just 15 minutes off a podium position.																					
With the arrival of Saturday morning came renewed spirits for many. Dauwalter arrived to sun atLa Fouly running 26 minutes under her own course-record pace. Lâ€™Hirondel and Xiang came in just under 50 minutes back, but now there was daylight, in the form of a couple of minutes, between the women. Hartmuth remained in fourth, 65 minutes down, SolinÌska in sixth, Yingling in seventh, and Spainâ€™sMaite Maioracame through in eighth looking relaxed and focused. Stanley remained in the top 10. Bohard finally succumbed to injuries from her fall and would withdraw from the race.																					
By La GiÃ¨te, 130 kilometers in, the gap between Dauwalter and second place was over an hour, but the fight between the rest of the top five remained tight. Xiang moved into second and Hartmuth third, just minutes apart, as Lâ€™Hirondel began to feel the distance and time in her legs and dropped back to fourth place. SoliÅ„ska and MacDonald continued in fifth and sixth, running together almost two hours behind Dauwalter.

Things remained relatively unchanged at Trient at 144 kilometers. Dauwalter looked good, Xiang was 66 minutes back, Hartmuth was a mere minute behind her, and Lâ€™Hirondel following next in fourth. SoliÅ„ska and MacDonald followed another 50 minutes back, with Maiora trailing them by 15 minutes.																					
With victory seemingly all but assured for the American, the battle for the other two podium spots started to get heated on the closing climbs and kilometers. Through Vallorcine at the base of the final major series of climbs,Hartmuth moved up into second after biding her time the entire race, now seven minutes ahead of third-placeXiang and fourth-place Lâ€™Hirondel, a further nine minutes back. Maiora led SoliÅ„ska in fifth and sixth just under two hours behind the leader.																					
Near the top of the final climb at TÃªte de BÃ©char, 161 kilometers in, it was Hartmuth in second, 56 minutes down. Lâ€™Hirondel moved into third 15 minutes back and Xiang kept the pressure on for the final podium spot, trailing by just four minutes. The next gap to Maiora remained about 30 minutes.																					
Meanwhile, Dauwalter made short work of the final descent to the finish line in Chamonix, finishing in 23:29:14 and completing the ultimate trifecta of ultrarunning, winning the Western States 100, Hardrock 100, and UTMB all in one year. â€œAnytime you have a chance to take on a crazy challenge, I think we should,â€ she said afterward.																					
The battle for the final two podium spots didnâ€™t let up until the very end. Coming through La Floria, just four kilometers from the finish, Hartmuth led Lâ€™Hirondel by a mere nine minutes, and both women looked strong all the way to the finish. They would finish just over 40 minutes behind Dauwalter, Hartmuth in second at 24:10:52. Lâ€™Hirondel, the multi-time trail world champion, finished in third at24:22:50 for her debut 100 miler.																					
Blandine Lâ€™Hirondel finished third at her debut 100-mile race, the 2023 UTMB nonetheless. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks																					
Xiang would fade away from podium contention in the final kilometers but held on for an incredible fourth-place finish, improving on her seventh place in 2022. But really, the excitement of her race finish was only added by receiving a marriage proposal on the finish line. Having met her now-fiancÃ© â€” she said yes! â€” four years ago at UTMB, the proposal really was a perfect ending to her race.																					
Maiora finished fifth, an impressive result after her DNF in the race in 2021.

After a history of struggling with UTMB, the American men showed up this year withJim Walmsley(post-race interview) andZach Miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) taking the top two-spots on the podium. Two vastly different racers with different approaches to the event, the two were able to push each other from start to end, with Walmsleyâ€™s ever-consistent pace finally winning out in the end with a new course-record time of 19:37:43. But with a stacked field, with nine of last yearâ€™s top 10 back for another crack at the race, and last yearâ€™s championKilian Jornetout with injury, it was anyoneâ€™s bet throughout most of the race of who would come out on top.																					
Thereâ€™s never a non-chaotic start to UTMB, and this year was no different. With nerves and excitement running high, it was Franceâ€™sArthur Joyeux-Bouillon(pre-race interview)who led at Saint-Gervais, 21 kilometers in, with the entire rest of the field hot on his heels. But as darkness fell on the race and the kilometers ticked by, several distinct groups began to form. Coming into Les Contamines, 32 kilometers in, it was Zach Miller, Jim Walmsley, and the U.K.â€™sTom Evans(pre-race interview)bunched up and running together. It looked like there would be the potential of a repeat of the Miller-Evans bromance from 2022, with the addition of Walmsley as a third. FrenchmanMathieu Blanchard(pre-race interview)andPetter Engdahl(pre-race interview), a Swede who lives in Norway,teamed up just a minute behind the leading trio, and the rest of the top-10 men came in within five minutes of the leaders.																					
ByCol du Bonhomme at 44 kilometers, it was clear that Walmsley was there to put his mark on the race. Miller doggedly hung on 30 seconds back, and Evans came through another 30 seconds in arrears, looking decidedly worse than the two men in front of him. Franceâ€™sGermain Grangier(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), Blanchard, Engdahl, and Joyeux-Bouillon continued to run together just eight minutes off the lead.																					
Germain Grangier ran a consistent race to finish third at the 2023 UTMB. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks																					
The head of the race remained amazingly consistent over the coming kilometers toCourmayeur, 81 kilometers into the race. Walmsley led Miller by a handful of minutes, Engdahl and Grangier followed, running close to each other in third and fourth, at under 20 minutes back after Evans decided to call it a day. Joyeux-Bouillon and Blanchard stayed within half an hour of the leader in fifth and sixth.																					
Ever the aggressive racer, Miller made his move before Arnouvaz, 99 kilometers in. He came through the checkpoint leading a fatigued-looking Walmsley by two-and-a-half minutes. Many wondered if this was just another instance of Walmsley taking the early race out too hard and paying for it later. Grangier, Joyeux-Bouillon, and Engdahl all came through the checkpoint within 30 minutes of Miller, still well within striking distance if either of the two Americans fell back. The rest of the top-10 men also remained close, with a large group containing New Zeaklandâ€™sScotty Hawker, Franceâ€™sThibaut Garrivier, Blanchard, Switzerlandâ€™sJean-Philippe Tschumi, and Germanyâ€™sHannes Nambergercoming in hot and fast.																					
Coming over a dark and foggyGrand Col Ferret at 103 kilometers, Miller extended his lead to nearly four minutes, but Walmsley looked determined and seemed to have found a second wind. Grangier continued to hold strong just 12 minutes behind the leader, and the chase pack of the rest of the top 10 remained relatively unchanged with several of the men teaming up to run the final kilometers to daybreak together.																					
Itâ€™s always a question of when the actual racing at UTMB starts. That is, when do runners make their move and hope that it sticks? Coming intoChampex-Lac at kilometer 126 on Saturday morning, it was starting to seem like perhaps Millerâ€™s early move might be the one that worked for the American. With an 11-minute gap over Grangier and Walmsley, who were now running together, Miller looked strong and focused. But there was still a lot of racing to do, and a lot of mountains between him and the finish.

Whether Walmsley was actually in a spot of bother in the later hours of the night, or if it was all part of his strategy to hold back until daylight, everything changed when the sunlight lit up the Alps. By kilometer 139 atLa GiÃ¨te, heâ€™d whittled his gap to Miller down to two minutes, and by Trient six kilometers later, heâ€™d moved back into the lead of the race, a position he wouldnâ€™t relinquish. Grangier continued to run in third, with fourth, fifth, and sixth place, Joyeux-Bouillon, Blanchard, and Franceâ€™sLudovic Pommeret, all moving together 44 minutes back from the battle up front.																					
With the kilometers ticking by, Walmsleyâ€™s lead only continued to grow. At kilometer 154 atVallorcine, he was more than 13 minutes ahead of a struggling Miller. Seven kilometers later at TÃªte de BÃ©char, the gap was up to 16 minutes. From here, it would be just one more climb up to La FlÃ©gÃ¨re before the course tipped downward to Chamonix. Grangier maintained his third place up the final climb, with Blanchard in fourth and Pommeret in fifth, more than an hour back on the leader. Garrivier ran in sixth, while Hawker and Joyeux-Bouillon were seventh and eighth, 92 minutes back from the lead.																					
Once on the final descent, there was no touching Walmsley, and one can only imagine the thoughts and emotions that must have been going through his head. After five attempts at the race, the ultimate student of the course had finally figured out how to put together the race everyone thought he was capable of. He crossed the finish line to huge cheers from the crowd with a time of 19:37:43, breaking Kilian Jornetâ€™s course record of 19:49:30. Wiping away tears while receiving congratulations from past UTMB championFranÃ§ois Dâ€™Haene, it was clear how much this victory meant to him.

Fellow American Miller came across the line in second with a time of 19:58:58, looking completely spent. This was his best finish during what can only be called an extended relationship with UTMB starting in 2016. Granger completed the podium with a 20:10:52.

Blanchard, last yearâ€™s second-place UTMB finisher, ended just off the podium in fourth. Maybe one of the more impressive results of this years race was of Pommeret in fifth. The 48-year-old masters athlete, who was the 2016 UTMB champion and 2022 TDS winner, showed that age really is just a number. The other surprise in the top 10 has to beTyler Green, the American who made a late race move to finish in seventh. He didnâ€™t move into the top 10 until TÃªte de BÃ©char, 161 kilometers in.																					
Race favorite Petter Engdahl withdrew at Champex-Lac, 126 kilometers into the race.

2023 CCC Results: Albon and Kaspersen Win Over Deep Fields,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-ccc-results,"Thereâ€™s nothing quite like theUTMBMont Blanc festival week, and the 2023CCCis the final lead-up to the big dance. Racers, numbering 2,406 this year, took off from Courmayeur, Italy, on Friday, September 1 at 9:15 a.m. to cover 101 kilometers (63 miles) and approximately 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) of elevation gain.																					
The course, going in the opposite direction from theTDS, which runs earlier in the week, traces a sinuous path through the mountains, paying a visit to Champex-Lac, Switzerland, and finishing at the hub of the weekâ€™s festivities, Chamonix, France. Often used as a stepping stone for racers eyeing UTMB in the future, itâ€™s always a competitive race on both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s side, and this year was no exception. Like the other races this week, the CCC was run on a slightly modified course, but the change didnâ€™t affect its distance or vertical gain.																					
You can also check out more results from the weekâ€™s UTMB Mont Blanc festival:																					
Jonathan Albon(U.K.) ran away with the top honors at this yearâ€™s CCC by executing what appeared to be a measured and well-planned race strategy. Finishing second in the race in 2022, he had the knowledge of what he needed to do to win it. Lurking in the top 10 early in the race, Albon seemed content to bide his time. But when it was time to go, no one was able to stay with him.																					
Albon pulled away from the rest of the field not only by running faster, but by being incredibly efficient in the aid stations. He took on all of his nutrition and liquid while still standing, refusing to sit down and waste any time. Even in a race this long, each second counts. Over the top of the final climb at La FlÃ©gÃ¨re, he was five minutes clear of his next competitor. Known for his descending, Albon never looked back and finished with a time of 10:14:25.																					
Jia-Sheng Shen(China) came closest to matching Albonâ€™s pace to finish second, a significant improvement over his fourth-place finish in the race in 2022. Shen meant business from the get-go and took the race out fast. He led for much of the time until Albonâ€™s unrelenting pace simply became too much. He finished just under 10 minutes back with a time of 10:22:30.

Full results.																					
The 2023 CCC menâ€™s podium (l-to-r): 2. Jia-Sheng Shen, 1. Jonathan Albon, and 3. Dakota Jones.																					
It was pure dominance fromYngvild Kaspersen(Norway) in the womenâ€™s race this year. Finishing 30th last year must have been a learning experience that she put to good use this time around. From early in the race, she held a solid gap on her closest competitors. At Champex-Lac, 53 kilometers into the race, she was already 20 minutes up, and the gap only continued to grow. She finished in 11:51:22, nearly 40 minutes up on the next woman.																					
The 2023 CCC womenâ€™s champion, Yngvild Kaspersen, coming down the finishing chute.																					
Emily Hawgood(Zimbabwe, lives in the U.S.) is no stranger to the UTMB Mont Blanc festival events, and her second place here with a time of 12:28:19 showed that sheâ€™s only continuing to improve. She finished sixth last year at UTMB and 10th in 2021. Sheâ€™s also one of the many people who are choosing to double up a UTMB festival event with the Western States 100 earlier in the year. She finished an impressive fifth in that jaunt through the California mountains, a much different environment from the CCC course, showing that sheâ€™s a versatile runner who can handle many conditions.																					
The race for the final spot on the podium came down to a battle betweenHelen Mino Faukner(U.S.) andHau Ha Thi(Vietnam). With just the slightest of margins, the American was able to hold on to third with a time of 12:38:05. Thi finished just 23 seconds behind.																					
The North American contingent had a strong showing in the second half of the top 10.Emily Schmitz, Emmiliese Von Avis,andTara Fraga,all of the U.S., landed in the top 10, as didArden Youngof Canada.

2023 OCC Results: McCann and Angermund Run to Victories,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-occ-results,"The 2023OCCrace left OrsiÃ¨res, Switzerland, at 8:15 a.m. on Thursday, August 31, and sent 1,729 runners through Champex-Lac, Switzerland, and on to the finish in Chamonix, France. The point-to-point route through OrsiÃ¨res, Champex-Lac, and Chamonix, with the abbreviated race name coming from the town names, is often called the Little Swiss Sister ofUTMB.																					
While the course is a relatively short 55 kilometers (34.2 miles), itâ€™s packed with an impressive 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of elevation gain through the high mountains. With a rockslide closing one of the trails between Trient and Col de Balme, runners took a slightly more direct route than in years past, which together with cool and dry conditions, plus the ever-increasing depth of competition at this event, meant fast times.																					
Last yearâ€™s winners,Manuel Merillas(Spain) andSheila Aviles(Spain) did not return to defend their titles, but there were many fast women and men to challenge for the win.

The depth of the womenâ€™s field for the 2023 OCC was impressive, but after 55k, it wasToni McCann(South Africa) who ran into Chamonix solo for the win with a time of 5:18:21. Last yearâ€™s OCC fifth-place finisher put together a solid race start to finish and looked absolutely ecstatic, if a little bit shocked, when crossing the finish line with plenty of time to celebrate her win. The South African runner is coming off a string of victories this season already, including the Davos X-Trails and Transvulcania by UTMB 50k.

All eyes were on the 2022 UTMB champion and 2023 Western States 100 second-place finisher,Katie Schide(U.S.), and she didnâ€™t disappoint at this much shorter distance. An American living in France, Schide has a long history with the UTMB race festival events, including an additional two top-10 UTMB finishes in 2019 and 2021 and a second place at CCC in 2018.																					
In the final kilometers of the race, it was clear that Schide would earn a podium spot, but it was unknown whether sheâ€™d be able to hold off a chargingMiao Yao(China). With the gap hovering at 15 to 20 seconds through the final minutes of the race, it seemed possible that Yao, a 2:37 marathoner, would have the leg speed to close the gap on the longer-distance specialist.																					
But in the end, by running the steps and squeezing every last second out of the course, Schide was able to hold on to second with a time of 5:26:25. Yao finished in 5:27:07.																					
Full results.																					
The 2023 OCC womenâ€™s podium (l-to-r): 2. Katie Schide, 1. Toni McCann, and 3. Miao Yao.																					
Stian Angermund(Norway) was first across the line for the 2023 OCC on a beautiful day in Chamonix with a time of 4:42:40. A blistering fast day on the course saw close times between the top four men in the final kilometers, but it was the Norwegian who was able to hold on to a lead that he established just over halfway through the race. Sitting in third at just under 30k into the day, he made his move on the climb up to the Col de Balme and never looked back.																					
This win is another in a long line for Angermund, who has already run away with victories in the Trail World Championships 50k and the Trail des Hauts Forts 20k this year. Surely this win was sweet redemption after his DNF at CCC in 2021.																					
Stian Angermund (Norway) took over the lead just over halfway and never looked back.																					
The battle for the final podium spots remained close betweenFrancesco Puppi(Italy),Antonio MartÃ­nez(Spain), andYou-Sheng Guan(China). Puppi ran a smart race throughout, staying near the front, but was as far back as ninth place at 23k into the race, and was able to put on the gas to slowly but surely move himself into second by the end. With a final time of 4:44:58, he was able to just stay ahead of MartÃ­nez, who finished on the final podium spot in 4:45:19. Puppi has already had a successful season with these shorter distances, including wins in the Lavaredo Ultra Trail by UTMB 50k and the Andersen Half Marathon Trail.

2023 TDS Results: Meier and Nakache Win on Rerouted Course,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-tds-results-meier-and-nakache-win-on-rerouted-course,"When it comes to summer trail racing, thereâ€™s no greater spectacle than theUTMBMont-Blanc festival of races based out of Chamonix, France. The 2023TDS, an acronym for Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, departed Courmayeur, Italy, just after midnight on Tuesday, August 29, with some 1,650 runners lighting up the mountainous route back to Chamonix.																					
With a late summer storm moving in and bringing the snow line down to under 2,000 meters, organizers rerouted parts of the course to accommodate the bad weather that continued on throughout the event. In the 13 years covering the festival, the iRunFar crew hasnâ€™t seen the snow line come so low from a summer storm. The normally 145-kilometer (90 miles) course was extended to 153 kilometers (95 miles) while still holding on to plenty of climbing, and the extra distance combined with the difficult conditions led to extended finish times.																					
You can also check out more results from the weekâ€™s UTMB Mont Blanc festival:																					
Christian Meier(Canada) started the race relatively conservatively over the first set of mountains and the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard before pushing the pace and starting to pick off the men in front of him. He took over the lead near Le Pas Dâ€™Outray, 90 kilometers in, and never looked back, slowly extending his lead over the rest of the field for the remainder of the race. A former professional cyclist, Meier has taken to ultrarunning with great success, winning the Trail Andorra 50k earlier this year. He ran to his TDS victory in 19:36:35.																					
Simen WÃ¤stlundof Sweden started out fast, leading the race for the first 90 kilometers, when Meier passed him in the high mountains. He made a valiant effort to stay with the Canadian and ultimately finished just over 20 minutes behind in 19:57:41. The Swedish orienteer and ultrarunner recently placed 22nd at the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k.

Rounding out the top three wasYannick NoÃ«l. The Frenchman started conservatively, dropping all the way down to 10th early on in the mountains. From there, he turned on the gas, slowly clawing spots back throughout the rest of the race, finally moving into third around the Col de Very, 112 kilometers in. He finished just a smidge over 20 minutes back from WÃ¤stlund in 20:18:02.

Starting further back early on in the mountains, the Frenchwoman bided her time, slowly but surely moving up in the field. By the end, sheâ€™d moved past every single other woman to finish the race in impressive fashion. Nakache is no stranger to success, winning the Marathon des Sables earlier in the year, as well as taking second at the 2023 Lavaredo Ultra Trail.																					
Fiona Porte(France) also ran a strong and steady race to finish second in 24:08:32. Porte came off an already impressive summer season with wins at the 2023 Lavaredo Ultra Trail, beating fellow Frenchwoman Nakache, and the MaXi-Race du lac dâ€™Annecy 80k.

2023 Hardrock 100 Results: Dauwalter Nails Double and French Dominate,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-hardrock-100-results,"The 2023Hardrock 100set off at 6 a.m. on Friday, July 14 in Silverton, Colorado, the small mountain town sitting in the early morning shadow of the mighty San Juan Mountains.																					
Faced with 102.5 miles and more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain, runners set out to traverse the massive and rugged counterclockwise loop â€” the event changes direction each year â€” around one of Coloradoâ€™s most impressive mountain ranges, heading first toward Lake City, then on to Ouray and Telluride, before returning to Silverton for the finish.																					
In the end, it wasAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of France to make it back to Silverton to kiss the rock first with a time of 23:00:07. He took the race lead from the start and never looked back.																					
For the women, it was another dominant performance fromCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), where she not only set a counterclockwise course record with a time of 26:14:12, but also an overall womenâ€™s record and a Western States 100-Hardrock 100 double record with a combined time of 41:43:42 â€” but more on all that in a bit.																					
But this edition of the Hardrock 100 wasnâ€™t easy for anyone. After a big winter in the San Juan Mountains, there was snow. And a lot of it. Large snowfields flanked Virginius Pass/Krogerâ€™s Canteen and Grant-Swamp Pass, and snowmelt made much of the course muckier than normal.																					
It wasnâ€™t just the snow that would provide environmental challenges beyond the normal obstacles found in the San Juans. The heat that was also unusual. With barely a cloud in the sky for the entire race and no chance of rain, temperatures soared in the 80s Fahrenheit at the courseâ€™s lower elevations and caused many runners a significant amount of distress.

Pre-race, the menâ€™s race seemed to be wide open with none of the top-four men of 2022 returning. Instead, a handful of men, some with Hardrock experience and even more without it, lined up to vie for the win. Itâ€™s probably fair to say that several men had ambitions for the win, and few were willing to pick a clear frontrunner.																					
On the other hand, it seemed like very few were willing to bet against Dauwalter for the win. Fresh off of hercourse record at the 2023 Western States 100just three weeks prior, the 2022 Hardrock 100 champion and record holder showed up to Silverton appearing recovered and ready. Still, running two 100-mile races in a three-week span provides a lot of miles for something to go wrong, and there were a handful of women ready to take advantage of a potentially tired Dauwalter.																					
A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Hardrock 100 possible!																					
Thanks also toLEKIfor its support of our Hardrock coverage.																					
Without any clear race favorite this year, the menâ€™s race was wide open, and Franceâ€™sAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) made the most of the opportunity to go to the front immediately, leading the race line-to-line. Even before the first mile was up, Dunand-Pallaz had opened up a gap on the rest of the field and never looked back, running steady and strong through the heat of the day and the dark of the night.																					
Behind Dunand-Pallaz, the race between the rest of the field never let up, but the gap to the leader continued to grow steadily as the hours passed. Silverton localAvery Collins(pre-race interview)led the early chase, along withDylan Bowman(pre-race interview), who had finished second here in 2021. While Dunand-Pallaz was running his first Hardrock 100, Bowman had course experience on his side, and Collins had the course in his backyard to train on.

Behind the two Americans, another Frenchman,BeÃ±at Marmissolle(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), was biding his time in third.Brian Culmo, SpaniardJavi Dominguez(post-race interview),Arlen Glick, former Hardrock 100 championJeff Browning,Paul Terranova, andJesse Haynesrounded out the top 10 in the early miles of the race.

Coming through the Maggie aid station at mile 15.5, it seemed like Dunand-Pallaz was going to give the menâ€™s record a run for its money, coming in about 10 minutes under course-record pace. By this time, he was also 10 minutes up on Collins, who was running in second. While Dunand-Pallazâ€™s gap on the course record had disappeared by the time he dropped into the Sherman aid station at mile 30, his gap on the rest of the field had grown to 13 minutes, now with Marmissolle running in second with Bowman and Collins just a couple of minutes back. The rest of the top 10 remained unchanged.

And aside from a few shuffles within the field, not a whole lot changed in the top 10 until the witching hours, after the heat of the day turned to the dark of night and legs started to get heavy. Then things started to change, and quickly. While the two Frenchmen continued their relentless march forward, both Collins and Bowman faltered, and it was Dominguez who left the Chapman aid station at mile 84 in third. Glick was fourth, Terranova fifth, and Browning sixth. Both Collins and Bowman took extended stops at Chapman to regroup, losing their positions but eventually headed back out on the trail to finish.

While others struggled behind him, Dunand-Pallaz crested the last climb well clear of the field. Marmissolle followed 40 minutes back. And from there, it was almost all downhill for the two Frenchmen. Dunand-Pallaz ran back into Silverton to kiss the rock and win his first Hardrock 100 in 23:00:07, the eighth-fastest time in history.																					
Marmissolle finished second and was followed by Dominguez who ran a steady and smart race from start to end finished third in 26:12:01. Glick finished fourth with a time ofÂ  26:43:05, and Browning would round out the top five with a time of 27:17:02.

If it wasnâ€™t forCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) running the Western States 100 just three weeks prior, crushing the womenâ€™s record there, and potentially being a bit worn out at the start line of the Hardrock 100, it would have been hard to find someone to bet against her winning the race this year. But if she were to falter, there were several women who were ready to jump at the opportunity.

For the first part of the race, it seemed like Franceâ€™sAnne-Lise Rousset SÃ©guret(post-race interview) was going to do just that. While Dauwalter led in the very early miles of the course, Rousset opened up a sizable gap coming through Maggie Gulch at mile 15.5 and was moving with enthusiasm toward Pole Creek, the next aid station. She came into Sherman at mile 30 in seventh overall in 6:29, looking strong. Dauwalter was just six minutes behind, andAnnie Hughes(pre-raceandpost-raceinterview) came in next, 52 minutes off the lead. With still many miles to run, it was still anyoneâ€™s race. FrenchwomanClaire Bannwarth(pre-race interview) came through just seven minutes later and was followed by Japanâ€™sKimino Miyazaki(pre-race interview), who was 1:22 off the lead but looking spry and happy.																					
The top-two women came back together through Grizzly Gulch at mile 36 with Hughes trailing them at just under an hour back. When Rousset led Dauwalter into Grouse Gulch, mile 43.5, by nearly 10 minutes after traversing Handies Peak, the course high point, it seemed like maybe the Western States 100-Hardrock 100 double was going to be too much for Dauwalter to handle.

But itâ€™s never a good idea to bet against the most dominant female trail ultrarunner of this generation. By mile 50, sheâ€™d closed the gap to four minutes, and in Ouray at mile 58.5, it was down to two minutes. When it came to the climb out of Ouray, Dauwalter made her move, and the elastic to Rousset finally snapped over the top of Virginius Pass. Dauwalter never looked back.																					
Meanwhile, Hughes stayed steady in third place while dealing with stomach issues and the rest of the womenâ€™s pack, including Miyazaki, Bannwarth,Christina Bauer,Whitney Mickelsen,Darla Askew,Becky Bates, and last-minute waitlist entrantEmily Halnon, who only got into the race the morning before, continued to chase â€” all within close proximity to each other.

Dauwalter ran into Telluride at mile 74.5, her pace still hovering just a few minutes over course-record pace, but now 23 minutes ahead of second-place Rousset, and executed the fasted crew stop of the Telluride aid station, getting in and out in under three minutes. She was on a mission.

Just 10 miles later, she was well below course-record pace, crushing the Bear Creek Trail climb out of Telluride and moving herself into third overall as some of the lead men began to falter. Rousset also continued her relentless march, and while she was 48 minutes back on Dauwalter at mile 84, she was only three minutes up on course-record pace.																					
In the end, there was no catching Dauwalter as she ran back to Silverton to kiss the rock with a new womenâ€™s counterclockwise course record of 26:14:12, besting the one set by the legendaryDiana Finkelin 2009, and finishing fourth overall. She also set a new overall womenâ€™s record, beating her old time of 26:44:36, which she set last year.

Not only that, she set a new overall record for the Western States 100-Hardrock 100 double with a combined time of 41:43:42, beating Jeff Browningâ€™s old record of 42:12:43 that he set in 2016.																					
Rousset would finish second after a gutsy run with a time of 27:29:55, which registers as the fifth-fastest time in event history, and Hughes would hold onto third with a time of 32:13:03 after spending nearly 100 miles battling stomach and breathing issues.

With large gaps between the first, second, and third women, all eyes turned to the competition between fourth and 10th where the time gaps were tight and the women were often in the aid stations together in the back half of the race. Miyazaki and Bannwarth ran in close proximity to each other battling for fourth and fifth, while Mickelsen, Halnon, Bates, Askew, and Bauer seemed to maintain the same overall pace as the miles ticked by.

2023 Western States 100 Results: Dauwalter Sets Course Record and Evans Executes for the Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-western-states-100-results-dauwalter-sets-course-record-and-evans-executes-for-the-win,"At 5:00 a.m. on June 24, 379 runners started the 2023Western States 100. And what a day those dreamers and doers had.																					
Climbing from the Palisades Tahoe ski area in Olympic Valley, California, to meet the sunrise, the runners chased the historic 100.2-mile course through its 18,000 feet of elevation gain and 22,000 feet of loss. The course was made more wild by the past yearâ€™s weather, but the day otherwise benefited from favorable temperatures.																					
Incredible snowfall and the late 2022 Mosquito Fire impacted course conditions. The first 15 miles were impacted by snow, and then runners faced a newly unshaded 16-mile stretch due to the fire damage. But race-day temperatures were well off the common 100-degree-Fahrenheit highs of past years. It was the raceâ€™s fourth-coolest day in history.

Womenâ€™s winnerCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) shattered the longstanding course record. Dauwalterâ€™s 15:29 finish was incredibly 78 minutes better thanEllie Greenwoodâ€™s2012 former course best. Favorable weather likely also contributed to the most sub-18-hour womenâ€™s finishes (9) in the raceâ€™s history. Menâ€™s winnerTom Evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) from the U.K. broke free after Foresthill, mile 62, and finished in 14:40. It was the raceâ€™s fourth-fastest ever and made him a 24-minute winner. Read on for more details on how the race unfolded.																					
A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible!																					
None of the first four women from last yearâ€™s race â€”Ruth Croft,Ailsa MacDonald,Marianne Hogan,Luzia Buehlerâ€” returned. That made Zimbabweâ€™sEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview) the highest returning finisher from 2022. Hawgoodâ€™s pretty much a race local now too, living in nearby Roseville, California. But it was 38-year-oldCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) that came into the race as a favorite. She won here in 2018 in 17:27 and was looking to avenge a late drop at the 2019 race.																					
Dauwalter was first up the Escarpment. At 2,500 feet, itâ€™s the raceâ€™s biggest climb and it happens right away in the first three miles. But 2022 UTMB winnerKatie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)Â was right there too. Schide, an American whoâ€™s lived in France for the past seven years, hit the top in 46 minutes with Dauwalter and the two dropped into the Granite Chief Wilderness together. Already Dauwalter and Schide, age 31, had a three-minute lead on third-placeIda Nilsson(pre-race interview) from Sweden.

By mile 11, Lyon Ridge, Dauwalter and Schideâ€™s lead on third-place Nilsson had ballooned to eight minutes. And then it got even bigger as the two completely broke away from everyone else. At mile 16, Red Star Ridge, no one was within 14 minutes of the front two. Nilsson, Hawgood, 2023 Black Canyon 100k winnerKeely Henninger(pre-race interview),Taylor Nowlin, professional triathlete-turned-ultrarunnerHeather Jackson, Canadaâ€™sPriscilla ForgieandJenny Quilty, and 2022 sixth-place finisherLeah Yingling(pre-race interview) all ran inside the early top 10.																					
The Mosquito Fire limited crew access this year and everyone met their crews for the first time at mile 30, Robinson Flat. Dauwalter was in at 5:07 and out within a minute, and still on her 2019 splits. Schide took a longer break and changed shoes, exiting the aid station three minutes behind the leader. The two had completely broken open the womenâ€™s race. Nilsson, in her 100-mile debut, had been alone in third to this point, but was now joined by Henninger, Hawgood, and Nowlin.

At mile 34, Millerâ€™s Defeat, the course record watch started. Dauwalter and Schide were under Dauwalterâ€™s own 2019 splits andEllie Greenwoodâ€™s2012 course record pace. Dauwalter was five minutes up on Greenwoodâ€™s splits, and Schide was three minutes faster. Even more, the two were over 30 minutes in front of third-place Hawgood at mile 38. Dauwalter and Schide were out front for the win and the course record, and the other contenders grouped behind them.																					
Dauwalter was red hot up the Devilâ€™s Thumb climb at mile 48, but Schide hadnâ€™t given up much time. She took longer in aid and left six minutes after Dauwalter. Hawgood, Nowlin, and Henninger came in together next, now 40 minutes behind second-place Schide.																					
At Foresthill, Dauwalter was 25 minutes up on record pace. Schide conceded only another two minutes over the last stretch and was 11 minutes behind Dauwalter. While Dauwalter and Schide were still off the front, the race dynamic was heating up behind. The third- through eighth-place women were all in Foresthill together with only three minutes separation. Hawgood was there first among the chase group, but Hungarian living in Hong KongEszter Csillag(post-race interview) quickly jumped from eighth at mile 52 to fourth at mile 62. Nilsson was fifth, and Henninger,Katie Asmuth, and Nowlin were all there too.

Dauwalter ran 2:10 from mile 62 Foresthill to mile 78 at the American River. Only the menâ€™s winner would run a quicker split on this day, and only eight men have ever run a faster split in the race â€” this was per the race organizationâ€™s livestream, which was citing Liam/@aidstationfireb on Twitter. Dauwalter was five levels better than everyone else, and she was boldly racing without a pacer too. Schide stayed comfortably in second, but fell further behind Dauwalterâ€™s quickening pace and river conditions necessitated that everyone cross the American River in a boat this year.																					
From Foresthill to the river, Katie Asmuth vaulted into third, past Eszter Csillag and Ida Nilsson. Asmuth was seventh at Foresthill and picked up four spots on the downhill Cal Street stretch, outrunning common expectations in coming back from injury. All three women split faster from Foresthill to the river than Schide did and even if the front two were gone, the women in general were running really fast. Thereâ€™s bound to be some bad luck in a 100 miler though, and Henninger fell just before the river and dislocated her shoulder. She would then drop from the race at mile 80, Green Gate, due to that injury.																					
Dauwalterâ€™s incredible second half and incredible race brought her to the Placer High School track finish in 15:29. Dauwalter completely shattered the record books and set a new standard that is likely to last for a lifetime. Ellie Greenwoodâ€™s 16:47 course record had stood since 2012. Dauwalter will next race the high altitude 2023 Hardrock 100 in Silverton, Colorado, on July 14. Dauwalter is the Hardrock course record holder, too, but Western States plus Hardrock will certainly be a challenging double.																					
Schide challenged Dauwalter early, and outpaced the rest of the womenâ€™s field in doing so. Schide was in second for much of the day, ultimately finishing as runner up in 16:43. That was also under the old course record.

Csillag, who wasfifth at the 2022 UTMB, had a remarkable second half to finish third in 17:09. It is the raceâ€™s fourth-fastest run ever. And she just edged out Asmuth, who moved up from last yearâ€™s ninth-place run to finish fourth in 17:21. Asmuthâ€™s time was just inside of Ruth Croftâ€™s winning time from last year, and is the raceâ€™s fifth-fastest ever.																					
Hawgood earned a second straight fifth-place finish. In 2022 she was able to finish fifth in 18:16 and in this yearâ€™s faster race Hawgood was fifth in 17:26. That time ranks eighth-best ever and is just faster than what Dauwalter ran to win in 2018.																					
Taylor Nowlin improved her finish place by one from prior year, but like Hawgood greatly improved her finish time. Nowlin was sixth in 17:40. One-hundred-mile debutante Ida Nilsson was seventh in 17:43, and Priscilla Forgie was just minutes back in eighth at 17:46. Leah Yingling was a repeat top-10 finisher in ninth at 17:49. For perspective, no year had seen more than three women finish under 18 hours before. But this year nine women finished under 18 hours. It is the new standard for womenâ€™s racing at Western States.																					
The 25-year-oldMeghan Morgantook the prized 10th-place finish in 18:11, thereby guaranteeing a chance to automatically return next year.

Thereâ€™s nowhere to go but up at the start of the Western States 100, andJia-Ju Zhaofrom China charged the opening climb. Despite snow, Zhao hit the top in 42 minutes. Slower to the top, FrenchmanMathieu Blanchard(pre-race interview) and BritTom Evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) turned to greet the brilliant sunrise together.																					
Zhao won the Ultra-Trail Mt. Fuji 100 Mile in April 2023 and is a two-time winner of the Doi Inthanon by UTMB 100 Mile in Thailand. He pushed his early lead to five minutes at Lyon Ridge, mile 11, while 2022 fourth-placerTyler Green(post-race interview) led the early chase group.Green had finished as high as second here before, in 2021, but was running more aggressively toward the front earlier than ever before.

From mile-15 Red Star Ridge to mile-25 Duncan Canyon, the chase group started to make up time on Zhao. Tom Evans, Chinese runnerJia-Sheng Shen, andDakota Jones(pre-race interview) were among a group that cut four minutes from Zhaoâ€™s lead over just nine miles.Evans was third here in 2019 in 14:59, and Jones had just biked 680 miles from his home in Utah to the race start.																					
Zhao was quickly swallowed up in the next five miles to Robinson Flat, mile 30, and soon fell out of the top 10. A lead trio of Tom Evans, Dakota Jones, and Jia-Sheng Shen came into aid at 4:45, meeting their crews for the first time. At mile 30 and with Zhao falling backward,Anthony Costales(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was fourth, and then he was with Tyler Green at mile 38 in fourth and fifth. The two would barely separate the rest of the race.

Evans and Jones dropped Shen on the climb to Devilâ€™s Thumb, mile 48, and the two leaders came into aid together in 7:03. Four minutes back Costales had caught Shen on the big climb, and Tyler Green,Jeff Colt, New Zealandâ€™sDaniel Jones,Ryan Montgomery, Mathieu Blanchard, and 47-year-oldLudovic Pommeretwere inside the top 10. Those six were 14 minutes apart. 2022 third- and second-place finishersArlen Glick(pre-race interview) andHayden Hawks(pre-race interview) were back in 11th and 16th, respectively. After earlier moving up, Hawks had just lost several places and would later drop with injury at mile 55. Other top-10 finishers from 2022Cody Lind,Scott Traer, andAlex Nicholswere all noticeably outside the top 10 too.																					
As the race shifted to its mile-62 Foresthill hub, Evans gained some separation on Jones and entered the aid station first, but as Evans changed shoes and socks, Jones didnâ€™t wait and exited first. Jones was now in the lead by himself for the first time and he was overheard voicing his intention to break Evans. Some 11 minutes back of those two leaders, Green and Costales were again together and in third and fourth. Shen and Jeff Colt were just minutes back of those two, and Colt was remarkably almost an hour faster than a year ago when he finished 11th.

Jones and Evans separated leaving Foresthill and anticipation ran high for their next steps. The two had been together for nearly the entirety of the race to this point. Jones wanted to make a move and Evans wanted to keep up with (the) Jones. The duel ended quickly and dramatically though. Tom Evans dropped hard down Cal Street, hitting what he said at the finish was a 5:54 minute/mile, and hit Cal 2, mile 71, in 10:12. That surge pushed Jones eight minutes back at mile 71. It was just nine miles from Foresthill to that split on Cal Street, but the front two had shattered and moved in opposite directions the rest of the race.																					
Evans ran alone to the river crossing at mile 78, and ultimately to the finish. Tyler Green, Anthony Costales, Jeff Colt, and Jia-Sheng Shen all overtook Dakota Jones on the way to the river too. Forget about Elm Street, Jones was having a bit of a nightmare on Cal Street.																					
Evans, the 2022 UTMB third placer, continued to put time on the field the rest of the way. He finished in 14:40 and thatâ€™s the raceâ€™s fourth fastest finish ever. The mark trails onlyJim WalmsleyandJared Hazenin 2019, and Walmsleyâ€™s 2018 mark too. Evans was a runaway winner, but the rest of the top 10 was much more closely packed.

Tyler Green pushed on in second, and held off an Anthony Costales chase over the last 15 miles. Green finished in 15:04. It was his second runner-up finish and a big personal best for the course. He was able to finish with his baby boy on his shoulders. Greenâ€™s 15:04 was the raceâ€™s 11th-fastest finish ever. Costales was third in 15:09, the raceâ€™s 13th-fastest finish ever.																					
Jia-Sheng Shen and Daniel Jones both finished fast. Shen clocked 15:19 and Jones was fifth in 15:22. Mathieu Blanchard and Ryan Montgomery both overtook Jeff Colt late. Those three â€” Blanchard, Montgomery, and Colt â€” finished in 15:37, 15:38, and 15:42, respectively. Local runnerCole Watsonbettered his 2022 14th-place finish with a ninth-place 15:54.																					
In 2019 the top 10 all went under 16 hours. This yearâ€™s 10th-place manJanosch Kowalczykfrom Germany just missed matching that feat. He finished in 16:09.																					
Seven of last yearâ€™s top 10 returned, but only Tyler Green was able to again make the top 10. The 2022 top 10 finishers Ludovic Pommeret, Arlen Glick, Scott Traer, Cody Lind, and Alex Nichols finished 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th, and 28th this year, respectively. As earlier mentioned, 2022 runner-up Hayden Hawks dropped.																					
After running near or in the lead through Foresthill, Dakota Jones finished 17th in 17:00.																					
Early leader Zhaoâ€™s high risk, high reward start ended with a drop at Michigan Bluff, mile 55.

2023 World Mountain Running Championships Up and Down Results: U.S.â€™s Murphy and Ugandaâ€™s Chemutai Win Big in Innsbruck,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-world-mountain-running-championships-up-and-down-results,"Call it the 2023World Mountain Running Championships Up and Downrace or call it the Classic race, but the two lapper closed out the 2023World Mountain and Trail Running Championshipson June 10, and what a four-day stretch it was!																					
The men started at 12:30 p.m. local time and the womenâ€™s race ran 90 minutes later, both on a 15-kilometer course that gained 751 meters of elevation. Thatâ€™s 9.3 miles and 2,463 feet. The race started in town and certainly featured more road terrain than many expected, including a section of trail created over top of road. In fact, nearly 3.6k of each lap was on the road.

Doubling from a third-place finish in the Uphill race three days earlier,Grayson Murphyof the U.S. positioned herself near the front from the start, and led defending championRebecca Cheptegeifrom Uganda by a few steps five minutes into the race when climbing on trail.																					
Tove Alexanderssonfrom Sweden started slower but ran downhill into second just less than 20 minutes into the race, and then overtook Murphy two minutes later. Alexandersson led Murphy by 11 seconds at halfway, but Murphy wasnâ€™t done.

Some 34 minutes into the race Murphy regained the lead while climbing, quickly pushing past Alexandersson and building an immediate lead. Murphy was faster on the ups, and Alexandersson on the downs, it first appeared, but Murphy completely broke her chaser. It wasnâ€™t close the rest of the way.																					
Grayson Murphy was way ahead at the finish with 64:29 on the clock. Alexandersson was second in 65:26.																					
In addition to the 2023 Uphill bronze medal, Murphy won the 2019 World Mountain Running Championships too. Alexandersson, age 30, is a world leader in orienteering and ski orienteering.

Womenâ€™s Teams																					
[Editorâ€™s Note:Christel Dewalle previously served a four-month doping ban after a positive test for the stimulant Heptaminol at the 2016 Skyrunning World Championships.]																					
What a crazy race. A number of lead changes and an early celebration, combined with the mixed terrain of the course, added to the excitement.																					
Liam Meirowof the U.S. towered over a shorterIsaac Kibetfrom Uganda right after the start, and as soon as they left town and moved to the trail it was Kibet in the lead. He stayed there for eight minutes until Kenyaâ€™sPhilemon Kiriagopassed,Â and then Germanyâ€™sFilimon Abrahamdid a short while later too. A bunch of others soon skipped in front too as the race got going in earnest. All of the top runners were racing in road shoes, reflective of the limited rock and root on the course.

Just before halfway Ugandaâ€™sEliudCherop, fifth at last yearâ€™s race, joined Kiriago and Abraham in a three-person lead group, and then Cherop broke free from the group. He led under the halfway arch in 26 minutes and mistakenly had a moment of muted celebration and finish line confusion after the first of two laps.																					
That let Kiriago and Abraham regain Cherop when the climbing resumed, and Kiriago and Abraham traded positions through the next section. Kiriago dropped Abraham and started to stretch the lead some 35 minutes into the race, but UgandanLeonard Chemutaiwas surging behind. Chemutai, like Kiriago at only 20 years old, first collected Abraham and 48 minutes into the race passed Kiriago for the ultimate lead.

The breakaway three carried those positions to the finish, with some separation in between. Chemutai finished in 56:14 for gold. Kiriago was second in 56:22, and Abraham won individual bronze in 56:27. The three each waved flags through the finish chute.																					
Chemutai remarkably won the junior race at last year in Thailand. He did not race the earlier Uphill race, but Kiriago was seventh three days earlier.

2023 Trail World Championships 80k Results: Victories All Around for France,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-trail-world-championships-80k-results-victories-all-around-for-france,"After last yearâ€™s event in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the 2023Trail World Championships 80k, now part of the combinedWorld Mountain and Trail Running Championships, returned to Europe and the Tyrolean Alps, with the event jointly hosted by the village of Neustift im Stubaital and the city of Innsbruck, Austria.																					
With too much snow on the original course, organizers made a last-minute change to an alternate course that routed the middle part of the course over lower mountains between the start in Neustift in the Stubai Valley and the finish in Innsbruck. The change didnâ€™t seem to affect the character of the course or reduce its difficulty. Deemed one of the most, if not the most, technical course that the Trail World Championships has dished up, times were relatively slow for the 80-kilometer (actually 87k/54 miles) course which had 6,500 meters (21,000 feet) of climbing and even more descending over trails that were slower than many others normally used in European ultramarathon races.																					
The start of the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks																					
On the menâ€™s side, the event had nine out of the top-10 men from last yearâ€™s Trail World Championships 80k returning, with only the defending champion missing from the lineup. This means that last yearâ€™s second- and third-place men in Franceâ€™sNicolas Martin(pre-race interview) and Italyâ€™sAndreas Reiterer(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) were returning just seven months after their podium finishes. After several big results in 2021 and 2022, Germanyâ€™sHannes Namberger(pre-race interview) came in as one to watch.																					
The women similarly returned two top runners from last yearâ€™s Trail World Championships 80k, includingreigning world championBlandine Lâ€™Hirondelof France (pre-race interview) andGemma Arenasof Spain, who was third in 2022 and would be running her sixth Trail World Championships.																					
But, as racing tends to go, nothing turned out as expected. In the end, it wasBenjamin Roubiol(post-race interview) andMarion Delespierre(post-race interview), both of France, reaching the Innsbruck finish line first after a day of close racing and frequent lead changes. Roubiol waited until the final climb to put the pressure on a tiring Reiterer, whoâ€™d spent much of the race in the lead.																					
The womenâ€™s race was equally close with the top-three women coming into the base of the final climb at 66k within two minutes of each other. After racing a very patient and smart race, Delespierre had enough in the tank to pull away fromKatharina Hartmuth(post-race interview) of Germany andManon Bohard Cailler(post-race interview) of France on the final climb and descent.																					
There were no surprises in the winners of the team competition, with France walking away with both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s titles, although the U.S. men made it a close call!

Starting under cool and clear skies in Neustift, the menâ€™s race went out fast up the â€œstarting loop,â€ which happened to feature a 1,200-meter (4,000 feet) climb over 8.2 kilometers straight out of the starting gate. While things hadnâ€™t split up significantly over the first climb, bothZach Miller(pre-race interview) of the U.S.Â andAndreas Reiterer(pre-race interview) of Italy came across the top in the top 10, clearly stating their intents for the day.																					
Back down in the valley, the two chasedBaptiste Chassagneof France as the top three, as the race left the Stubai Valley and headed back up into the mountains toward Innsbruck.Benjamin Roubiolof France,Peter FraÅˆoof Slovakia,Aritz Egeaof Spain, andThibaut Garrivierof France all ran comfortably in the top 10, though Garrivier looked noticeably distressed compared to the others. Pre-race favorite,Nicolas Martin(pre-race interview) of France, was not in contention and would eventually drop after the halfway point due to knee pain.

By the 36k mark, Reiterer had taken over the lead from Chassagne as they went over the biggest climb of the day, tallied at 1,400 meters (4,600 feet). From an outside observerâ€™s perspective, Reiterer looked incredibly comfortable, running well within himself and appearing to have everything under control. Egea, Miller, Roubiol, Garrivier, and FraÅˆo all stayed in the top 10, all within 10 minutes of each other, biding their time.																					
Over the course of the next three major climbs, all around 600 meters (2,000 feet), high in the mountains between the two host cities, Reiterer continued to lead the slowly stretching field. The steep trails were no barrier to his steady effort and the raceâ€™s cameraman was seen breathing harder than he was. Roubiol followed about six minutes back over the top of the last climb in the series, with FraÅˆo, Egea, and Garrivier completing the top five, still within 10 minutes of each other. Miller continued to hold on in sixth.

More than halfway now, the runners bombed down into the village of Grinzens in the valley at 54k, now back to their original starting elevation, except on the other side of the mountains, with more descending to go before the final climb and descent into Innsbruck. Reiterer and Roubiol maintained their top-two positions while the rest of the top 10 continued to shuffle amongst themselves with Garrivier continuing to move up in the field and Miller dropping another place into seventh. Miller, looking spry and claiming that he still had legs, continued to keep tabs on the men in front of him, clearly intent on reeling them in.																					
Continuing down to the low point of the course in Kranebritten at 66k, the top five looked like Reiterer, Roubiol, FraÅˆo, Garrivier, andTomÃ¡Å¡ FÃ¡rnÃ­kof the Czech Republic. Now, all that stood between the front end of the race and the finish was a final 1,000-meter (3,400 feet) climb and a wild drop back down into Innsbruck. While anything could happen, with more than a four-minute lead, it seemed like it was Reitererâ€™s lead to lose.

But on the final climb of the race, the ever-patient Roubiol made his move, surging into the lead at AspachhÃ¼tte at 71k, and opening a four-minute gap on a fading Reiterer. Roubiol looked incredibly focused as he made his way up the mountain. FraÅˆo and Garrivier remained solid in third and fourth, and Miller started to make good on his promise of still having legs, moving into fifth. The gap between Roubiol and Reiterer only continued to grow, eight minutes at 73k, and nine minutes at 75k, as they made their way to the top of the final climb. FraÅˆo stayed strong in third, Garrivier in fourth, and Miller and FÃ¡rnÃ­k continued to battle for fifth, 25 minutes off the lead.

From there, it was all downhill to the finish. Benjamin Roubiol flew down the final descent to win the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k in 9:52:59. Reiterer followed just under eight minutes back, the gap holding steady the whole descent. FraÅˆo and Garrivier both held onto their places to finish third and fourth. Behind them, U.S. teammatesDrew HolmenandEric LiPumamade a strong push to catch up to their teammate Miller. Holmen would out sprint Miller at the line, and the two were followed less a minute later by LiPuma, the trio taking fifth through seventh.																					
For the team competition, Chassagne would be the third French finisher in 17th place, securing the team victory for France. The strong fifth through seventh finishes of the U.S. men slotted them into second in the team competition, just over five minutes behind the French in over 30 hours of cumulative racing. Reiterer would lead the Italian team to a third-place finish.

As with the menâ€™s race, some of the pre-race favorites bowed out of the race early on withBlandine Lâ€™Hirondel(pre-race interview) dropping on the â€œstart loopâ€ out of Neustift due to foot pain from an existing injury. The rest of the field charged on, led up the first climb byMarcela VaÅ¡Ã­novÃ¡(pre-race interview) of the Czech Republic,Martina Valmassoi(pre-race interview) of Italy, andAkiyama Honokaof Japan.																					
The top five, made up ofAllison Bacaof the U.S., VaÅ¡Ã­novÃ¡,Azara GarcÃ­aof Spain, Valmassoi, and Honoka, all came back through the village of Neustift at 18k and headed out into the mountains toward Innsbruck within two and a half minutes of each other.

The front of the race continued to reshuffle up the dayâ€™s biggest climb, that 1,400-meter (4,600 feet) doozy. VaÅ¡Ã­novÃ¡ continued to lead with a smile, opening up a sizable gap to Germanyâ€™sKatharina Hartmuthand Valmassoi, who were running within a minute of each other 36k into the race. Baca andRosanna Buchauerof Germany rounded out the top five as the race approached the halfway point.

VaÅ¡Ã­novÃ¡â€™s and Valmassoiâ€™s fast start seemed to take a toll on the two women as they traversed the following three climbs and descents high in the mountains, with VaÅ¡Ã­novÃ¡ looking noticeably rougher than the quickly closing Hartmuth, who looked downright comfortable. By the top of the final 600-meter (2,000 feet) climb in the middle section of the course, the two women had dropped back in the standings with Hartmuth taking over the lead with a five-minute gap over second-placeManon Bohard Caillerof France. Buchauer andMarion Delespierreof France trailed second by less than half a minute now, 49k into the race and only one major climb left to go. Pre-race favoriteGemma Arenasof Spain continued to work her way up the field after a slow start and ran just inside the top 10 in ninth place.

The top five remained mostly unchanged except for a slight shuffle after the dramatic drop into Grinzens village at 54k, with Bohard Cailler, Delespierre, and Buchauer all running within 20 seconds of each other, four minutes behind Hartmuth, who continued to lead and look strong. She was clearly enjoying her day out in the mountains, but the descent seemed to take its toll. Bohard Cailler and Delespierre, whoâ€™d been chasing together after dropping Buchauer, finally closed the gap to the leader into the final drop to the town of Kranebritten at 66k. Now, with the top-three women within two minutes of each other with one massive climb to go, it was anyoneâ€™s race and all three started up the final incline focused and silent.

Delespierre seemed to be the one with the most gas in the tank for the final kilometers and huge climb as she quickly opened a three-minute gap on Hartmuth at 73k. The gap stayed steady over the top of the climb at 75k, with Hartmuth fighting hard to catch the leader on the final downhill run in to the finish. Bohard Cailler was a further six minutes behind at the top. From there, the gap opened significantly to Buchauer and Valmassoi.																					
The top-two women looked to be moving incredibly strongly on the final descent, but the distance to close the gap was rapidly running out for anyone giving chase. In the end, no one could touch a flying Marion Delespierre who would cross the finish line in first to win the 2023 Trail World Championships 80k. Hartmuth and Bohard Cailler held onto their respective positions about seven and 12 minutes back, and an elated Valmassoi finished fourth. Buchauer ran strong from start to finish to round out the womenâ€™s top five.

2023 Trail World Championships 40k Results: Franceâ€™s Geoffray Wins Late, Norwayâ€™s Angermund Repeats,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-trail-world-championships-40k-results,"French runnerClÃ©mentine Geoffrayand Norwayâ€™sStian Angermundwon individual gold, and the French women and U.K. men finished first in the team race at the 2023Trail World Championships 40krace.																					
Day two of racing at the 2023World Mountain and Trail Running Championshipsstarted at 9:00 a.m. local time on Thursday, June 8, in downtown Innsbruck, Austria. The women and men shared a common start, and 45 kilometers and 3,194 meters â€” thatâ€™s 28 miles and 10,479 feet â€” later the group finished in the Stubai Valley.																					
The course was a challenging net-uphill route, temperatures in Innsbruck stretched up to 23 degrees Celsius and 74 degrees Fahrenheit, and weather moved in and out around the course. In the end, due to adverse weather, the race was halted at around the 35k mark, with the final 50 or so runners unable to continue.																					
As in all of the races here, there was a â‚¬16,500 prize purse that gave â‚¬4,000 to the winner with money stretching five deep.

For the second day in a row, it was the womenâ€™s race that left the race win until late.																					
Switzerlandâ€™sJudith Wydergrabbed an early lead and built a gap through the middle of the race. Wyder, returning from serious injury, ran alone for most of the morning.

Nearly four-and-a-half-hours into the race though,ClÃ©mentine Geoffraycaught Wyder on a hands-on-knees climbing section. Geoffray, this yearâ€™s French Trail National Champion, powered past and quickly built a gap on the longtime leader as the two plunged to the finish on a 1,400-meter descent over 6.5 kilometers.																					
Geoffray hit the finish just over two minutes in front, officially finishingÂ in 4:53, and Wyder trailed in second at 4:55.

Geoffrayâ€™s win perhaps was a surprise to many. She won the Skyrace des Matheysins in France just weeks ago. Wyder, age 34, was a world-class orienteer as recently as 2018 before transitioning to trail running.																					
The two frontrunners built a big gap on the rest of the field. It was over 14 minutes before third-placeTheres Leboeufof Switzerland finished next in 5:09.

It was just last November 2022 thatStian Angermundwon this same championships in Thailand. He did that race in 3:08. It took longer this year on a more challenging course, but Angermund repeated his victory and it was quite dominant.																					
Always near the front, Angermund gained the solo lead some two hours into the race, about the same time that skies darkened with a storm threatening overhead. Occasional rain caught Angermund, but no one else.																					
The 36-year-old Angermund finished in 4:19. Earlier this year he won the 68k at Istria by UTMB in Croatia.

Thomas Roachof the U.K. was a surprise second. He trailed Angermund for much of the day, and as with the womenâ€™s race, was just over two minutes back of the race winner. Roach, a 42-year-old who lives in Innsbruck, Austria, finished in 4:21. He was eighth at the Zegama Marathon in May.																					
It was Angermund and Roach in front for nearly the entirety of the race, in that order, but unlike in the womenâ€™s race, the chase pack wasnâ€™t far behind here.

2023 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill Results: Kenyaâ€™s Kipngeno and Austriaâ€™s Mayr Win Gold,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-world-mountain-running-championships-uphill-results,"Welcome to Innsbruck! The city of 130,000 in western Austria, and the mountains of the Stubai Valley to the southwest of the city, just kicked off the second-ever combinedWorld Mountain and Trail Running Championships.																					
The 2023 festivities opened on Wednesday, June 7, with the 2023World Mountain Running Championships Uphillrace and Kenyaâ€™sPatrick Kipngenoand Austriaâ€™sAndrea Mayrearned the eventâ€™s first individual golds. Kipngeno finished in 40:18, a repeat win from last year, and Mayr topped out in 48:14. It was incredibly Mayrâ€™s seventh world championship win.																					
The course gained 1,020 meters over 7.1 kilometers and finished way up high at the Elfer Hut above the Stubai Valley. Alternately, thatâ€™s 3,346 feet across 4.4 miles.

Bursts of AC/DCâ€™s â€œT.N.T. â€œand Queenâ€™s â€œWe Will Rock Youâ€ pumped the runners up at the start and they mightâ€™ve jumped the line just a second or two early. A Spanish runner went down right away at the start, clutching his right shoulder as the field ran away. The race started with a 900-meter flat-ish road section through town, as a way to get to the trails and gain some separation.

Canadaâ€™sAlexandre Ricardjoined a Kenyan and Ugandan lead pack for the first several minutes, wisely distancing from the bigger group. Thatâ€™s because only three minutes into the race a fence gate bottlenecked runners further back. And then less than 10 minutes into the race, slower runners were already grabbing a few power-hike steps on the steeper terrain.																					
Halfway up the mountain Ricard was gone from the lead pack, and defending championPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya asserted himself at the front.Levi Kiprotichfrom Uganda was in pursuit, and Kenyan and Ugandan runners were in third and fourth too, setting up for a close team race.Joseph Gray, the 2019 World Mountain Running Champion from the USA, had moved up nicely and raced in fifth.

The race finished on crowd-lined singletrack above treeline, and Kipngeno was so far ahead that he had time to high five spectators while smiling before finishing. Kipngenoâ€™s 40:18 finish was 93 seconds better than everyone else. He was exactly that far ahead last year too. Kipngeno will double back for Saturdayâ€™s World Mountain Running Championships Up and DownÂ race.																					
Levi Kiprotich was second in 41:51, perhaps giving up some time to his chasers late. Kenyaâ€™sJosphat Kiprotichand Ugandaâ€™sEliud Cheropwere third and fourth in 42:04 and 42:16, respectively.																					
Joseph Gray stayed in fifth in 42:32.																					
Each countryâ€™s first three runners scored in the team competition, and scored via finish position (not by time), and with three runners inside the top seven, Kenya totaled only 11 points to win team gold. Uganda placed second with 21 points, and Switzerland was a surprise third.

The women took off at 2:00 p.m. local time, an hour after the menâ€™s start, in 23-degree Celsius (80-degree Fahrenheit) sunny skies. That same 900-meter rolling road section meant another sprint start with Kenyan and Uganda runners at the lead, andAllie McLaughlin, last yearâ€™s World Mountain Running Championships Uphill Champion, leapt into the early lead a few minutes in too, and only after clipping that problematic fence gate.																					
Fifteen minutes into the race though things were different and Austriaâ€™sAndrea Mayrmoved into the lead and quickly opened a minute-plus gap.

Kenyaâ€™sPhilaries Kisang, last yearâ€™s Thyon-Dixence race winner in Switzerland, spied Mayr from a distance, and when the grade eased a little, Kisang quickly made up time on Mayr. As the two moved above tree-line, Kisang improbably regained the lead and put a few steps on Mayr. The excitement was short lived as Mayr moved back past Kisang and mercied her into hiking.																					
Mayr clutched the host country flag as she finished, and the added drama of that late duel certainly outshined the excitement of the earlier menâ€™s race.																					
Mayr finished in 48:14 and Kisang was second in 48:51.																					
Mayr, a seven-time world champion who was second at last yearâ€™s World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race, was incredible. Mayr, now age 43, is a former steeplechaser and a two-time Olympic marathoner. This was her first world championships win since 2016, and comes a remarkable 17 years after her first win in 2006. Her other wins came in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 â€” all uphill years, back when the championships alternated uphill and up-and-down years. Mayr, as with menâ€™s winner Kipgneno, won â‚¬4,000. That was part of a total â‚¬16,500 cash purse that went five deep.

Kenya easily won the team race, placing three runners inside the top 10. Their 17 points was followed by Germany with 33 for second place, and the U.K. was third with 51 points.

2023 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Results: Victory for Manuel Merillas and Daniela Oemus,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-zegama-aizkorri-marathon-results,"Spainâ€™sManuel Merillasand Germanyâ€™sDaniela Oemuswon the 2023Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon, in doing so ushering in first-time champions and new storylines to the iconic event.																					
Like last year, the Zegama Marathon opened the 2023 Golden Trail World Series (GTWS) when the event started on Sunday morning local time, on May 14, 2023. The event is a doozy, delivering over 8,800 feet of climb in the marathon-length course through steep ascents and descents, and consistently technical terrain.

Zegama also delivers one of the best fan-runner interaction experiences in the sport of trail running, with a purported 15,000-plus fans lining its mountainous course come rain or shine to watch the competition.																					
While this yearâ€™s event didnâ€™t match last yearâ€™s deep competition and fast-and-furious racing to both the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s course records, set at 4:16:43 byNienke Brinkmanfor the women and 3:36:40 byKilian Jornetfor the men, it was the same celebratory party of trail running for which the event is known, along with plenty of competition to keep us all on our toes.																					
Unlike last yearâ€™s nearly perfect racing weather, this year brought rain, thick clouds, and tricky underfoot conditions courtesy of that weather, likely slowing times on the burly course by a bit, but certainly not tempering the energy of both runners and fans.																					
The 2023 Zegama Marathon saw a new champion in Germanyâ€™sDaniela Oemus, who crossed the line in 4:31:54. It was most certainly a breakout victory for Oemus, whose top results until now have been a fourth place at the 2022 Marathon Mont-Blanc and a 14th at the 2022 OCC.																					
Oemus ran to victory through placing herself in podium position or nearly so from about 15 kilometers onward. She moved into first position by the halfway point, at the top of the Aizkorri climb, which is the courseâ€™s high point. From there, she added seconds to her lead at each of the checkpoints, including on the final technical downhill back to the town of Zegama. At the finish, she was just over 2 minutes clear of her nearest competitor.

Second place was New Zealandâ€™sCaitlin Fielder, who finished in 4:34:04. Like champion Oemus, Fielder put herself in podium position early in the race and stuck with it, never falling back further than fourth position, no matter if it was a steep up or down, or one of the eventâ€™s sneakily fast flat sections. When she crossed the line to celebrate her second place, she had plenty of distance on third place, some 3.5 minutes.																					
Theres Leboeufof Switzerland improved on both her place and time from the 2022 edition of this race, taking third in 4:37:41. Last year, she was seventh in 4:39:55.

Because of the Zegama Marathonâ€™s iconic status as a competitive spring mountain race, over the years itâ€™s brought in the top competitors of mountain running, who often return year after year. Spainâ€™sManuel Merillasâ€™sstory is no different.																					
Merillas has finished the event at least a half dozen times, landing on the podium multiple times and as close as second place in the past. In 2022, he took third in 3:45:43, we believe his fastest time at the event until now. This year, he vaulted all the way to the winnerâ€™s position, setting another Zegama Marathon personal best in 3:42:01.																					
Merillas ran to victory using a style which has previously worked well for him, by letting others set the pace and moving up as the race progresses. This year, he moved into pole position by around 34k into the race, and increased his lead to a scant 27 seconds at the finish.

MoroccanElhousine Elazzaouialso improved on last yearâ€™s fourth place in taking second place this year, and a time improvement by about five minutes. Elazzaoui moved into podium position a few kilometers after the halfway point, and landed in second by around 28k in, a position heâ€™d hold to the finish.																					
Jon Albon, who is from the U.K., but who lives in Norway, took third place in 3:45:01. Albon raced steadily all race, running in or just beyond podium position by a couple seconds, from basically the first checkpoint onward. He even moved into the leadership position by 28k, before yielding it at about 34k, and moving back into third place by the finish line.

Before dawn on Saturday morning, May 6, from El Faro de Fuencaliente, the south tip of La Palma island, Transvulcania fired off and runners raced for the sky. By the time the 72-kilometer (44.7 miles) course concluded in the city of Los Llanos de Aridane on the islandâ€™s west side, participants racked up some 4,600 meters (15,000 feet) of climbing. During that distance, they ran through volcanic cinder, over lava rocks, among the islandâ€™s famous banana plantations, over the islandâ€™s approximately 2,420-meter (7,940 feet) high point, and on the race courseâ€™s infamous descent from that high point to sea level.

Once things shook out over the first two hours, the 2023 Transvulcania Ultramarathon turned into a three-woman race. Polandâ€™sEdyta Lewandowskawas the pacesetter on the womenâ€™s side, going through Los Canarios seven kilometers into the race in 49:19, a full two minutes ahead of South Africaâ€™sMeg MackenzieandMartina Valmassoiof Italy. From there, Lewandowska continued to hold a two-to-four-minute lead over Valmassoi in second though El ReventÃ³n (31 kilometers), while Mackenzie settled into third, running by herself in the womenâ€™s race.																					
As the race continued its relentless climb, Lewandowska added to her lead over Valmassoi, expanding it to seven minutes at 37k, 12 minutes at 46k, and 14.5 minutes at the raceâ€™s high point of Roque de los Muchachos (51k).																					
And, then, Valmassoi started descending. Wow. Just nine kilometers later at the checkpoint of Torre del Time, Valmassoi had cut a full 13 minutes off of Lewandowskaâ€™s lead, trailing by merely a minute and a half. Fast forward to the next checkpoint in the seaside town of Tazacorte at 68k and Valmassoi had a 13-minute lead on Lewandowska with less than five kilometers to go. Game over.																					
Martina Valmassoi won the 2023 Transvulcania Ultramarathon in 9:09:13. Edyta Lewandowska held on to second, finishing in a time of 9:21:40, while Meg Mackenzie continued onto to the finish in Los Llanos de Aridane in her long-held third position in 9:28:06.																					
Notably, Mackenzie was a full half an hour behind Lewandowska at the raceâ€™s highpoint at 51k, and closed the gap to just seven and a half minutes at the finish.

By the second aid station at Las Deseadas at 17k, the menâ€™s podium formed at the head of the race, even if that wasnâ€™t clear at the time, with Franceâ€™sDamien Humbert,Dakota Jonesof the U.S., and Italian runnerAndreas Reitererat the head of the race. Fourteen kilometers later at El ReventÃ³n (31k), Reiterer and Jones had a few-second lead on Humbert.																					
From there, Jones made what would become the decisive move of the race, putting more than a minute on Humbert and four on Reiterer by Punta de los Roques at 37k. Jones added a small amount to his lead as the race continued to climb to its highpoint at Roque de los Muchachos (51k) and then quickly added even more to his lead at the start of the nearly 8,000-foot descent from peak to ocean.																					
After the relatively small climb back to the finish in Los Llanos de Aridane, Dakota Jones won in 7:02:16 with Damien Humbert taking second exactly eight minutes later in 7:10:16. After spending the second half of the race running alone in third, Andreas Reiterer held onto that position, finishing in 7:17:26.

2023 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: McKnight Makes Comeback, Ostaszewski Takes Gold,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-cocodona-250-mile-results,"There was plenty of drama in the 2023Cocodona 250 Mileâ€” it just happened over days of running through the Arizona desert.																					
The 2023 edition began on Monday, May 1, and concludes on Saturday, May 6. Now in its third year, the ultramarathon once again delivered the goods.																					
The route begins in Black Canyon City and finishes in Flagstaff. With nearly 40,000 feet of elevation gain, a maximum altitude of 9,135 feet, and a cutoff time of 125 hours, the Cocodona 250 Mile demands every ounce of physical and mental strength from its runners.

Itâ€™s also long enough to deliver some surprises, and this year was no exception.																					
Michael McKnightendured a tough first half of the race, then drew on some hidden reserves to crank back to first place for what event officials called theâ€œultimate comeback.â€Sarah Ostaszewskicame in first for women, while running for the Aravaipa Racing Team.																					
Runners continued to trickle over the finish line as of Friday afternoon.

After snagging a second-place finishlast year,Michael McKnightdelivered a time of 69:41:31 to take first place this week â€” but it was a rocky road.																					
â€œMichael suffered through some tough patches in the first half of the race but rallied hard and put the hammer down in the higher elevations to wind his way up to the win,â€ the race organization wrote onInstagram.																					
Josh Perrycame in second with a finish time of 70:57:52. He showed the traits of a seasoned thru hiker by delivering a swift and steady performance, organizers said.																					
Coming in third wasMichael Greerwith a finish time of 72:47:07. Greer dropped out of the race line-up last year after a fall left him with a broken hip just a few weeks before the race. Returning this year â€” and making it to the podium â€” marks another remarkable comeback story.

Sarah Ostaszewskikeeps getting faster. The runner has participated in the Cocodona 250 Mile for all three years, and once again upped her game. She placed fifth in 2021 with a time of 99:24:49. She knocked that down to 84:21:24 for a third place last year.																					
Then she sliced nearly 12 hours off her time for a 72:50:27 finish on Thursday, taking first for the women.																					
Aliza Lapierrecrossed the finish line about four hours later, arriving with a time of 77:04:14. She slowed in the final 50k after injuring her neck in a fall.																					
Then thereâ€™s third-placeMika Thewes, who fought through several falls, then â€œrepeatedly rubbed some dirt onto those wounds and carried on,â€ the event wrote onInstagram.																					
She arrived just an hour and a half after Lapierre, earning a time of 78:27:13.

2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships Results: Murphy is Double Champion and Curts Cleans Up,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-usatf-mountain-running-championships-results,"[Editorâ€™s Note:This article is written by guest writer,Jim Graham. Also, our article with Saturdayâ€™s2023 USATF Vertical Mountain ChampionshipsÂ resultsis now live.]																					
When veteran New Hampshire mountain runner and race co-directorTom Hooperposted a pre-race note advising, â€œWear shoes with large lugs,â€ it meant that an already technical course would be downright epic on Sunday, April 30, for the 2023USATF Mountain Running Championships.																					
Rain-soaked with deep mud, loose leaves, slippery roots, and even slush, the championships event at Mount Sunapee featured deep menâ€™s and womenâ€™s fields, vying for spots on Team USA at the 2023 World Trail and Mountain Running Championships in Innsbruck, Austria, June 6 to 10.																					
It wasDaniel CurtsandGrayson Murphywho, ahem, weathered the conditions best to win Sundayâ€™s race.																					
Curtsâ€™s win follows his third place at Saturdayâ€™s USATF Vertical Mountain Championships, and Murphy doubled up with wins in both daysâ€™ events. You can read our2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships results articlefor more of that race story.																					
â€œThe talent here was amazing for both the men and women, so seeing athletes of that caliber racing on such a technical course on a day like this was absolutely amazing,â€ Hooper said.																					
The light rain that arrived midway through Saturdayâ€™s vertical race turned into a downpour overnight, with temperatures dipping to the low 40s Fahrenheit and the wind gusting to over 30 miles per hour by Sunday morning. Covering 8.2 miles with 3,400 feet of elevation gain, the two-lap course was designed with the world championships in mind, saidPaul Kirsch, race co-director.																					
â€œWe pride ourselves on designing challenging courses that will give the U.S. the best team possible, and these courses are a great test for selecting our top runners for Austria,â€ Kirsch said.																					
Grayson Murphyfollowed up Saturdayâ€™s USATF Vertical Mountain Championships victory with another commanding win in this classic up/down race, finishing in 1:08:56, leadingAllie McLaughlin, 1:11:53	Rachel Tomajczyk, 1:16:35	 andKasie Enman, 1:16:40. These top four made the U.S. team.																			
This means that this yearâ€™s Team USA womenâ€™s classic up/down team will contain three world champions: Murphy, who was the 2019 World Mountain Running Championships winner	 McLaughlin, the 2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill winner	 and Enman, the 2011 World Mountain Running Championships winner.																			
â€œWe have such a strong team and with such great experience, Iâ€™m really excited to see what we can do in Austria,â€ Murphy said.																					
Starting at the base of the mountains, Murphy and McLaughlin stayed close through most of the first climb, with Murphy opening a gap on a flatter section near the summit and gaining a lead of about a minute. But Murphy knew sheâ€™d have to stay aggressive down the steep and untracked ski-area glades just beyond, which saw runners taking spills throughout the day.																					
â€œAllieâ€™s a great competitor. She always comes prepared and shows up with her A game, so I knew I couldnâ€™t afford to back off,â€ said Murphy, who extended her lead to 1:36 by the end of the first lap.																					
McLaughlin, who will compete in both the vertical and classic up/down world championships races, said sheâ€™s worked hard on her downhill technique since she began preparing for the Alaskaâ€™sMount Marathon Racelast year, which she won in course-record-setting time. â€œI could see how strong Grayson was on the downhills, so I really just tried to focus on holding on and having fun with it, without taking any huge risks,â€ she said.

Daniel Curtssaid he had hoped for a better finish in Saturdayâ€™s vertical race, where he took third place, and he went to bed Saturday night thinking about redemption and a win in Sundayâ€™s classic up/down race. But he wasnâ€™t so sure when he woke up.																					
â€œHonestly, my legs felt terrible when I got up. I actually had doubts about finishing,â€ Curts said. â€œBut as we got closer to the race and I warmed up a little, it all came back pretty well.â€																					
Going out in a tight group, Curts gradually opened a small gap by the summit and completed the first lap in the lead by 24 seconds. Keeping the pressure on, Curts padded his lead on the second lap climb, winning in 1:01:04. He was followed closely throughout by a pack that included CanadianAlexandre Ricard, who won the vertical race on Saturday and was second on Sunday, in 1:02:43	Morgan Elliott, 1:02:51	Liam Meirow, 1:03:16	 CanadianRÃ©mi Leroux, 1:03:26	 andEdward Owens, 1:03:27.																	
Curts, Elliot, Meirow, and Owens qualified for the U.S. team, with Ricard and Leroux being Canadian.																					
â€œBasically, I knew I was okay at the top of the second loop, so after that I really focused on staying composed and staying on my feet,â€ Curts said. â€œIt was a tough course out there, and it wouldâ€™ve really easy to take a spill.â€

2023 Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile and 100k Results: Ultramarathon Sprint Finishes and Golden Tickets Galore,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-canyons-by-utmb-100-mile-and-100k-results,"Change was in the air at this yearâ€™s Canyons by UTMB event, held on Friday and Saturday, April 28 and 29, in Auburn, California. There was the addition of a new 100-mile race, as well as a change to a multi-looped format for both the 100-kilometer and 100-mile races, as opposed to the net uphill, point-to-point course which the 100k had traditionally followed.																					
The new routes for both the 100k and 100 miler promised to stay on the historic Western States Trail for at least 50% of the distance â€” taking in 10,500 feet and 17,000 feet of elevation gain respectively â€” but avoided the parts of the trail still feeling the effects of record snowfall this past winter.																					
The 2023Canyons by UTMB 100khad its appeal as the final Western States 100 Golden Ticket race, where the top-two women and men earn entry into the race. The winners wereIda Nilsson, a Swede who lives in Norway, andCole Watson, and both were successful in their second attempts at securing Golden Tickets this year.																					
The event was also a UTMB World Series Major, meaning the top-10 men and women in the 50k, 100k, and 100-mile races secured entry into the UTMB Worlds Series finals, held this August, in Chamonix, France. This brought some competition especially to the 2023Canyons by UTMB 100 Milefor its promised spots on the 2023 UTMB start line, where wins were credited toMathieu ClÃ©ment, of Switzerland, andAlyssa Clark.																					
In this article, we first break down the 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100k, and follow it up with details from the 2023 Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile.

Eventual winnerCole Watsonstarted fairly conservatively, and was still back in sixth place at the 23k Cool aid station, letting others do the leadership work. He had moved into podium position by halfway, eventually taking the lead at Drivers Flat at 78k, to win the race in a time of 8:34:39. Watson missed out on the Golden Ticket with afourth-place finish at the Black Canyon 100kearlier this year, but has now earned his ticket to the Western States 100. From what we understand, he immediately accepted it.																					
Adam Merryâ€” who formed part of the USA team whotook gold at the 2022 Trail World Championships 80kâ€” also started further back to climb up through the field, moving into second position with 10k to go. He finished second in 8:50:40, affording him the opportunity to join those gold-medal-winning teammatesAdam PetermanandJeff Coltat the Western States 100.																					
Justin Grunewaldbounced back from a DNF at the McDowell Mountain Frenzy 50 Mile two weeks ago to take third in 8:53:30, just three minutes back from Merry, who had passed him in the raceâ€™s closing stages.

Ida Nilsson, of Sweden but living in Norway, really wanted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket. Flying all the way to the Black Canyon 100k this past February, andmissing the ticket with a fifth-place finish, she returned to the U.S. to race this event. She held off the rest of the womenâ€™s field commandingly, to cross the line in 9:51:07, and eagerly accepted that coveted Golden Ticket.																					
Canadaâ€™sPriscilla Forgiewas the second-place woman, crossing the line some nine minutes after Nilsson. While she earned a Golden Ticket, we understand sheâ€™s taking some time to decide if sheâ€™ll accept it.																					
Spainâ€™sAroa Siowas back this year, after takingthird at last yearâ€™s Canyons by UTMB 100k. Well guess what, third place for her again, rounding out an all-international podium.

One thing is for sure,Mathieu ClÃ©mentof Switzerland andCan-Hua Luoof China donâ€™t do ties. Neither could shake the other until the home stretch â€” the actual finish chute â€” when ClÃ©ment outsprinted Luo for the win. Both started reasonably conservatively, running in sixth and seventh respectively by the first checkpoint 5k in, before steadily climbing up the field.																					
Luo was the aggressor and was steadily gaining momentum for the first third of the race, before taking the lead by the first Browns Bar checkpoint, around the 30k mark.																					
ClÃ©ment had taken a little longer to make his move, but by the second Browns Bar checkpoint at 49k, he had crept his way up the field and overtaken Luo to move into the lead, by a margin of 32 seconds. We believe that was about the biggest gap there would be between the two for the rest of the day, as Luo caught up and they mostly ran the second half of the race together until that sprint finish.																					
Canyon Woodwardhad started out ahead of the two eventual winners, running in second at the 5k mark at No Hands Bridge, and briefly held the lead at the 23k mark. He fell back as far as ninth at the Mammoth Bar checkpoint, but recovered well to take the third podium spot in 17:46:05.

Alyssa Clarktook the win in 20:13:21, having run a steady and smart race at the front of the womenâ€™s field. This continues a great run of form for Clark, who also won the 2023 Hurt 100 Mile, as well as last yearâ€™s Lake Sonoma 100k and Moab 240 Mile.																					
Alexis Crellinran close to Clark all day, and just five minutes separated the two at Foresthill checkpoint at 106k, but Clark pulled away in the raceâ€™s final third. Crellin ultimately finished second in 20:55:06.																					
Prolific 100-mile racerAnnie Hughesclosed out the podium in 21:26, after running much of the race in third place. Hughes was the winner of the 2021 Leadville Trail 100 Mile, as well as the 2022 Cocodona 250 Mile and Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile.

Also, our article with Sundayâ€™s2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships resultsis now live.]																					
From smooth dirt road to slick roots, mud, and rocky climbs with grades up 40%, New Hampshireâ€™s Mount Sunapee delivered every condition imaginable over four miles and 1,900 feet of gain to test top mountain running talents in the 2023USATF Vertical Mountain Championships.																					
In the womenâ€™s race,Grayson Murphytook home the win via a huge gap on the rest of the field, to become the 2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships winner.																					
In the menâ€™s open race, CanadianAlexandre Ricardwas victorious, while second place and the first American home wasJoseph Gray, 2023 USATF Vertical Mountain Championships winner.																					
On day one of the two-day 2023 USATF Mountain Running Championships, hosted this year by theSunapee Scramble, the USATF Vertical Mountain Championships saw the top-three women and top-four men vying for national team selection for the World Trail and Mountain Running Championships in Austria, from June 6 to 10. The 2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill champion,Allie McLaughlin, earned an automatic spot to compete on Team USAâ€™s vertical team in Austria, leaving one less womenâ€™s spot to be claimed at this event.																					
Runners return to Mount Sunapee on Sunday, April 30, for the classic up/down mountain race, the USATF Mountain Running Championships, an 8.2-mile, two-loop race â€” and with heavy rain in the forecast overnight, a proving ground for both mountain runners and mud-taming trail shoes. Awarding $6,000 in total prize money, the Sunapee Scramble weekend is the first time that the U.S. has hosted a two-day championship to select Team USAâ€™s vertical and classic up/down teams.																					
Grayson Murphyopened a commanding lead from the get-go, hitting the singletrack more than a minute up on the field, and extending the gap through the gnarly climbs and winning the USATF Vertical Mountain Championships title in 35:47, more than four minutes up.																					
Taking second wasRachel Tomajczyk, 40:28	 andAlexandra Lawson, 41:03, with the top-three women punching their tickets to Austria.																				
A cold drizzle that arrived mid-race turned into steady, wind-driven rain, adding a new level of challenge for even the top women finishers.																					
â€œI wanted to go out hard and see if I could open things up before we went on the singletrack,â€ said Murphy, who is also racing Sundayâ€™s classic up/down event. â€œThen I was hoping I could just chill on the second half, where it was so technical I knew itâ€™d be harder for anyone to make up a lot of time.â€

Strategy proved critical over the first 1.5 miles, with the leaders jockeying for position on a smooth gravel road before dropping down onto rugged singletrack, where steep, wet, and technical climbs made picking a line and passing an added challenge. CanadianAlexandre Ricardled a tight pack of five into the woods and never let up, taking the overall win in the open race, in 32:12.																					
Leading the U.S. men and winning the USATF Vertical Mountain Championships title was perennial favoriteJoseph Gray, second overall in 32:23.																					
He was followed closely byDaniel Curts, 32:28	Edward Owens, 32:40	 andGarrett Corcoran, 32:43. Those top-four Americans earned spots on Team USA.																			
Following Ricard closely, Gray took a bad fall on the technical second half, dropping to third before recovering to grab another national title. â€œI took a spill and lost some time there, so I was glad I was able to recover and move back up a bit,â€ said Gray, who will focus on the vertical race at worlds in June. â€œI went down pretty hard, so I was a little worried after that and played it safe to the end.â€

2023 Marathon des Sables Results: Victory for Mohamed El Morabity and Maryline Nakache,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-marathon-des-sables-results-victory-for-mohamed-el-morabity-and-maryline-nakache,"For the 2023Marathon des Sables, victory goes toMohamed El Morabityof Morocco andMaryline Nakacheof France.																					
Taking place in the Sahara Desert in Morocco, the 2023 edition of the 250-kilometer (150 miles), seven-day, five-stage race kicked off on Sunday, April 23, with the final competitive stage closing on Friday, April 28.

Each year, more than 1,000 runners compete in the eventâ€™s five competitive stages, sleep at night in campsites, and operate with food and gear self-sufficiency. The race organization provides a shade tent in the camp, plenty of water, and medical and emergency assistance, when needed.																					
Given it takes place in the Sahara Desert, the event is known for its heat, as well as its sandy and rocky terrain. Official weather sources pointed to temperatures tipping over the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) mark during several days of this yearâ€™s event, and thermometers on the ground pitched up above 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 Celsius).																					
There were big upsets in the latter stages of both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s races, with nine-time championRachid El Morabityof Moroccowithdrawing after receiving a penalty for an infringementfollowing the fourth stage, while in second place in the overall classification.																					
On the womenâ€™s side, 2019 champion, race leader for the first three stages, and Dutch runner and firm favoriteRagna Debatsstruggled with digestive issues during the long Stage 4, and fell back out of contention for the win.																					
Although Mohamed El Morabityâ€™s victory might be somewhat tainted by the controversy surrounding his older brotherâ€™s withdrawal, Mohamed ran a stormer of a race, had already finished first in three of the four stages, and was in the lead overall at the time of the incident. While heâ€™s finished in second place a remarkable five times at this event â€“ each time behind his brother â€” this is his first victory of the Marathon des Sables.																					
Womenâ€™s champion Maryline Nakache had also run a steady and consistent race from the start, finishing second in each of the first four stages before ultimately moving into the overall womenâ€™s lead during Stage 4. This was her debut Marathon des Sables.

It was a speedy start to the week, with the first stage being about 36 kilometers long, featuring a climb to the summit of this eventâ€™s infamous Jebel El Otfal. Stormy and windy conditions in the afternoon made things difficult for the latter runners, but the front end of the race was largely unaffected by the storm.																					
Stage 1 went along predicted lines, withRachid El Morabitytaking the lead and finishing the stage in a time of 2:46. His younger brother,Mohamed El Morabity, and fellow Moroccan,Aziz Yachou, followed just a minute back in 2:47. The 2022 UTMB second-place man,Mathieu Blanchard, of France, was the first overseas runner to finish the stage, in fourth place in a time of 2:51.																					
Stage 2 was a bit shorter at just under 32k, but it moved into more technical terrain with increased elevation change. Rachid again took off in front, but in the latter part of the stage and on a smooth run into the finish, he was overtaken by his brother Mohamed, who won the stage in a time of 2:29, less than a minute ahead of Rachid in second and Yachou in third. Rachid still held the overall lead by a narrow margin at the end of the stage, followed by Mohamed and Yachou. Blanchard, who had finished fifth in the second stage behind Russiaâ€™sVasilii Korytkin, held on to fourth place overall.

In the third stage of around 34k, Mohamed asserted his dominance, winning the stage in 2:30 to Rachid and Yachouâ€™s 2:33, and extending his overall lead to three minutes. Blanchard continued to hold his own in fourth place.																					
The menâ€™s podium race for Stage 4 was so tight, especially given that it was the one long stage in the week in racing, this year clocked at 90k. Mohamed again crossed the line first, in 8:14:39. Yachou finished the stage in second place, just six seconds behind the lead, and Rachid arrived in third, only 19 seconds behind the winner. This tight race kept Mohamed in the lead in the overall classification, Rachid in second, and Yachou in third, but with a spread of only a few minutes.																					
Controversy ensued following this fourth stage, when Rachid was issued a three-hour time penalty for receiving outside assistance and withdrew from the race, which we have more on ina separate news piece. After Rachid withdrew from the race, Yachou moved up to second place in the overall classification. Blanchard, who was steadily running his own race behind the leaders, now found himself in podium position.																					
On the marathon-distance Stage 5, the last competitive stage, Mohamed continued his show of strength to finish in 3:18, five minutes clear of Yachou in second. In a total time of 19:19:54 for the five competitive stages, Mohamed El Morabity was crowned the 2023 Marathon des Sables menâ€™s champion.																					
A battle ensued behind, with Vasilii Korytkin eventually beating Blanchard to the line, to take third place in Stage 5. However, Blanchard hung on to third place overall in a time of 21:21:27.

The fast first stage was dominated as expected by 2019 winnerRagna Debats, who finished in 3:26, almost 10 minutes clear ofMaryline Nakachein second. The top local wasAziza El Amranyof Morocco, who followed in third in 3:53. While this was Nakacheâ€™s first appearance at this race, El Amrany was returning following a third place at the 2022 edition.																					
The more mountainous terrain on Stage 2 played to Debatsâ€™s strengths, and she romped home in 3:19 to Nakacheâ€™s 3:36, thus extending her overall lead to around 28 minutes. El Amrany continued to run steady in third position.																					
Into the third stage, Debats finished 11 minutes ahead of Nakache, for the stage win. But Debatsâ€™s finish time and place doesnâ€™t reveal the full story, that she lagged for a period during Stage 3, was passed and lost the lead, before regaining it to win the stage. As we would soon see, this was a harbinger of problems to come for Debats. El Armany again finished the stage in third, but this time only a minute back from Nakache and appearing very comfortable.

As we all now know, everything changed in the fourth day â€” the notorious long stage, which was 90k for 2023. Debats led at first, but then fell back a few hours after the start, reportedly suffering digestive issues. Admirably, although no longer in contention for a podium spot, she powered on to finish the stage in 21:34, nine hours and 49 minutes back of the lead. El Amrany, who appeared to be getting stronger as the week went on, won the stage in 11:44. Nakache again took second, this time trailing a different leader, and moved into pole position in the race overall, still almost 33 minutes ahead of El Armany in the overall classification.																					
For Stage 5, the raceâ€™s final competitive stage, Nakache sailed smoothly to the stage victory, finishing the dayâ€™s marathon distance in 4:18. This sealed Maryline Nakacheâ€™s victory at the 2023 Marathon des Sables with a total time of 27:02:17.																					
On this final day,Tomomi Bitoh, of Japan, was across the line in second in 4:33, and El Amrany crossed just a few minutes later in 4:36 in third place. El Amrany had a significant lead in second place, over Bitoh in third in the overall classification, so a fast finish was not needed. Following up on her third place last year, Aziza El Amrany improves to take second in the 2023 Marathon des Sables womenâ€™s race in 27:53:37, and Tomomi Bitoh took third in 29:39:51.																					
Early leader Debats finished in eighth place in the overall classification for the women.

2023 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: France Dominates, with Wins for Manon Bohard and Lambert Santelli,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-madeira-island-ultra-trail-results,"The 2023Madeira Island Ultra-Trailkicked off at midnight local time on Saturday, April 22. The 115-kilometer (72 miles) route travels from northeast to southwest, spanning the full width of the beautiful and rugged island of Madeira. Along the way, it takes in 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of arduous climbing and technical descending, beginning at sea level and climbing to almost 1,800 meters (5,900 feet) at its highest point at Pico Ruivo.																					
This yearâ€™s line-up was less competitive on both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s side to last yearâ€™s race, which saw both thewomenâ€™s and menâ€™s event records shattered, byCourtney DauwalterandJim Walmsley, respectively.																					
Where the Americans had dominated last year, this year was a French sweep, with French runners taking the win in both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s races. Menâ€™s winner,Lambert Santelli, was 10th in last yearâ€™s race and fifth in the 2019 edition. He managed to improve on his own time from last year by 38 minutes.																					
Womenâ€™s winnerManon Bohardplaced second in the 85k race at MIUT back in 2019. The 2021TDSwinner was right at home on this technical course, and stormed her debut at the 115k main event.

It was a decisive win for Franceâ€™sManon Bohard, who by the top of the first major climb, 14.5 kilometers in, had already established a lead of just over a minute on chaserAbby Hall(USA), who was two minutes clear ofLucie Jamsin(France) in third.																					
Past halfway at Curral das Freiras, 63k, Hall still hung on in second place, but Bohard had steadily extended her lead and was now almost 20 minutes clear in front. Meanwhile, Jamsin in third was applying pressure from behind and had closed the gap on second to a minute and a half.																					
Hall was found wanting on the mammoth climb that followed â€” 1,475 meters over 11k â€” to Pico Ruivo, the highest terrain of the route. Bohard summitted 19 minutes ahead of Jamsin in second, who was now almost 10 minutes clear of Hall in third.

Meanwhile, Switzerlandâ€™sLuzia Buehler, who had sat patiently in fifth place for the raceâ€™s first half, moved into fourth position by the high point at Pico Ruivo. She passed Hall on the rough, undulating 9k section that followed to ChÃ£o da Lagoa, by which point she had moved into podium position.																					
By the raceâ€™s final checkpoint at Porto da Cruz, 101k in, Bohard had put down an untouchable 45-minute lead. Jamsin followed in second, still 11 minutes clear of Buehler in third â€” who was more than a half an hour ahead of the rest of the field.																					
Having continued to extend her lead all day, Manon Bohard romped home in a time of 15 hours and 48 minutes, the 2023 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail womenâ€™s champion.																					
Luzia Buehler â€” having spent more than half of the race in fifth place before moving up to third for the last quarter â€” had a stormer of a last section, where she passed Jamsin to finish in second place in a time of 16:40.																					
Lucie Jamsin held on for third, crossing the line seven minutes later in a time of 16:47.

At 14.5k in, with already 1,515 meters climbed, just 32 seconds separated the top-four men as they reached the mountain plateau of Fanal â€” known for its ancient forests. These were Madeira Islandâ€™sLuÃ­s Fernandes, Swedenâ€™sPetter Engdahl, and French runners Lambert Santelli andBenoÃ®t Girondel.																					
By the end of the first technical descent to ChÃ£o da Ribeira, the same group made up the top four, with Fernandes having moved two minutes clear of Santelli, who was now in second place.																					
The lead group continued to trade places, with Engdahl leading for a time before Santelli moved into pole position before the 48k checkpoint at Encumeada.

Things then took a turn for the worse for Engdahl, who fell back from first to seventh position in the 16k stretch between Estanquinhos and Encumeada. He reportedly spent 20 minutes in the aid station being attended to by his crew before carrying on, but called it a day before the next checkpoint.																					
Another French runner, 23-year-oldHugo Deck, had climbed up the field to second place by Encumeada and remained in the top three through 84k, but then also withdrew from the race.																					
When the frontrunners reached the 63k checkpoint, Girondel had replaced Deck in second place behind Santelli and the two held position for the rest of the race, with Santelli crossing the line in 14 hours and one minute.																					
Girondel, who excels in technical ultras â€” having previously won the 2018Diagonale des Fousand placed second in the 2021 TDS â€” followed 12 minutes later, to take second place in 14 hours and 13 minutes.																					
Having lead the race in the early stages, and never fallen back further than sixth place, Madeiraâ€™s LuÃ­s Fernandes closed out the podium in a time of 14 hours and 23 minutes.

2023 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Results: Victory for Drew Holmen and Erin Clark,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-lake-sonoma-50-mile-results-victory-for-drew-holmen-and-erin-clark,"The 2023Lake Sonoma 50 Milesaw the race return to its former prominence as one of the most competitive ultramarathons in the U.S. this year. Kicking off at 6:30 a.m. local time on the shores of Lake Sonoma outside Healdsburg, California, both the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s races saw large packs whittled down over the first 20 or so miles of the race, before an eventual leader emerged, whoâ€™d later be overtaken before the finish line. In the end, it wasDrew HolmenandErin Clarkwho would come out on top after tight battles through the front of both fields.																					
This year sees the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile run on a new course, with the biggest change being a move of the start/finish to the parkâ€™s visitor center. The current course features nearly 10,000 feet (9,915 feet/3,302 meters) of climb and an equal amount of descent over its relentlessly rolling 50.8 miles (81.8 kilometers). The previous course had a reported 10,500 feet (3,200 meters) of climb, but thatâ€™s well within the margin of error. Still, itâ€™s best to consider this an entirely new course and only roughly compare this yearâ€™s times with those of the past.																					
For 2023, the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile served as a qualifier for the 2023Trail World Championships80-kilometer race, which will be held in June, in Austria. The menâ€™s and womenâ€™s podium finishers earned spots on Team USA.

A group of a dozen men took out the race, all passing through the Warm Springs Creek aid station at mile 13.5 roughly together. By mile 21, passing through the Madrone aid station outbound,Morgan Elliothad roughly a minute lead withPreston Cates,Zach Perrin,Drew Holmen,Seth Ruhling, andCaleb Olsonabout a minute back and withMatthew Seidel,Tracen Knopp, andRichard Lockwoodall within roughly another minute.																					
Midway though the race, Elliot continued to hold a minute lead on the field at Lone Rock, but he fell back to third with Holmen and Perrin together out in front by the return trip through Madrone at mile 30.4. Eight miles later, on the second pass through Warm Springs Creek at mile 38, Holmen had a full eight-minute lead on Olson, with Cates and Knopp running together in third, 10.5 minutes off the lead, and Lockwood holding fifth just over 15 minutes off the front.

Drew Holmen continued to build his lead on the way to winning the 2023 Lake Sonoma 50 Mile in 6:44 with Caleb Olson finishing less than 12 minutes back in second. Preston Cates pulled away from Tracen Knopp with the pair finishing third and fourth respectively.Chris Myersmoved up in in the final miles to take fifth, only a few seconds behind fourth place.																					
Full results.																					
At mile 13, the Warm Springs Creek aid station saw the first 25 runners through being all men and, then, what must have been the remnants of the womenâ€™s pack, as the next 13 runners through were all women.Tara Fraga,Hannah Osowski,Sarah Biehl,Anne-Marie Madden, andErin Clarkwere the first five in that train, but all 13 passed through within three and a half minutes. Eight miles later, outbound at the Madrone aid station, it was still 13-straight women after the first set of men. Osowski and Clark led that group with Fraga and Biehl less than a minute back andAllison Baca,Sarah Keyes, and Madden in another group less than 90 seconds off the lead.																					
Midway through the race, Keyes had a smallest of leads on Baca with Clark still within a minute of the front. Osowski and Fraga ran together less than two minutes off the lead. What a race!																					
Another four miles closer to the finish at Madrone inbound (mile 30.4), Keyes had built a 90-second lead on Baca with Clark less than two minutes off the front and both Osowski and Fraga still within five minutes of the lead. By mile 38 at Warm Springs inbound, Clark had closed the gap to Keyes with the pair now running together at the head of the womenâ€™s race, and with Baca in third still less than three minutes off the lead. Six minutes off the front, Osowski continued to run in fourth, whileLauren Puretzhad passed Fraga to move into fifth by the smallest of margins.

Mile 45 saw Clark running alone in the lead nearly four minutes ahead of Keyes with Baca now barely 20 seconds out of second place. Meanwhile, Osowski was less than three minutes out of second with Fraga having repassed Puretz to hold fifth position by a mere 90 seconds.																					
After seven hours of tight racing, It was Erin Clark who broke the tape for the women with a five-minute victory over Allison Baca. Sarah Keyes took third less than three and a half minutes behind Baca, and Hannah Osowski took fourth, less than 10 minutes behind the winner. Tara Fraga held off Lauren Puretz to take fifth.

Sanchez, Kelly, and Sabbe Finish the 2023 Barkley Marathons,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-barkley-marathons-results,"After 60 hours of brutal racing at the 2023Barkley Marathons,AurÃ©lien Sanchezof France finished in 58 hours, 23 minutes, and 12 seconds in his first finish of the infamous event. A short time later,John Kellyarrived at the finish in 58:42:23, becoming a two-time finisher and one of only three people to have finished the event more than once.																					
A bit over an hour later and with only 6.5 minutes to spare on the eventâ€™s 60-hour cutoff, Belgiumâ€™sKarel Sabbebecame the third finisher in this yearâ€™s event after crossing the line in 59:53:33.																					
Earlier in the event, the U.K.â€™sJasmin Parisbecame the second woman ever to start the fourth lap of the five-lap event in the eventâ€™s 36-year history.																					
A file photo of AurÃ©lien Sanchez during the 2019 John Cappis 50k. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell																					
The event got underway on Tuesday, March 14, in Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee. The notoriously brutal and mostly off-trail route covers roughly 130 miles and takes in about 63,000 feet of elevation gain. Runners are allotted 60 hours to complete all five 26-ish-mile loops, and up until this yearâ€™s event, only 15 runners had successfully done so in the raceâ€™s 36-year history.																					
This year marked better weather than the event has seen in years, with the main environmental challenges being long hours of darkness and cold nights in the late winter setting. Rain and fog, which have been omnipresent in some years, were absent in 2023.																					
In one of the sportâ€™s greatest quirks, due to the courseâ€™s remote location and an imperative to protect the ecosystem in which the event takes place, which precludes observation of the event by most anyone besides a select few members of the media, nearly the entirety of the event coverage came via theTwitter feed of ultrarunner and longtime Barkley reporterKeith Dunn.																					
Read on for more details on how the event played out on the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s sides.

The menâ€™s race had a promising field, including three-time Barkley Marathons finisherJared Campbell,Nickademus de la Rosa, who finished in 2013, and the most recent finisher â€” from 2017 â€”John Kelly.																					
As ever, the attrition rate was high for the first couple of loops. Campbell completed three loops within the 36-hour time limit to proceed onto loop 4 but opted not to continue and settled for a Fun Run finish.

However, some of the others had not yet had enough, and the race that is normally more about survival was evolving into a neck-and-neck battle. Just over 32 hours in, within seconds of each other,Albert Herreroof Spain, Kelly, and the U.K.â€™sDamian Hallall finished loop 3. Kelly was out on loop 4 first, after 23 minutes, with Hall hot on his heels. Herrero took a little longer and embarked on loop 4 with 33:03 on the clock. Three more men made it within the 36-hour time limit and opted to head out on loop 4, includingAurÃ©lien Sanchezof France.																					
With just two more drops from the menâ€™s field on loop 4, for the first time in Barkley Marathons history, four runners headed out on loop 5. These were, in order: John Kelly, AurÃ©lien Sanchez,Karel Sabbeof Belgium, and Damian Hall.																					
Kelly was first out with 46:02 on the clock, allowing him almost 14 hours to complete his final loop. In one of the many intricacies inherent to Barkley, where the runner is allowed to choose direction as the first runner, Kelly opted to run the final loop clockwise, with all subsequent runners alternating direction. One hour and 47 minutes separated the four remaining runners as they set out on loop 5, but Sanchez was hot on Kellyâ€™s heels, heading out just five minutes after the leader, though in the opposite direction on the course.

A Tweet from Keith Dunn read:â€œJohn is limping, AurÃ©lien is sprinting. In each of their minds, there is a halfway point in loop five, and both want to reach that point first. We have a race.â€																					
It was game over for Hall early on loop 5. Having reportedly gotten lost on Chimney Top, he returned to base with no book pages that serve as intra-lap progress markers.																					
After starting loop 5 in second place by only a few minutes, AurÃ©lien Sanchez ultimately crossed the line to become a finisher in 58:23:12. A scant 19 or so minutes in arrears, it was John Kelly across the line in 58:42:23. This was Kellyâ€™s second finish of the notorious event. Readhis report from his 2017 finish.																					
Belgiumâ€™sKarel Sabbebecame the third finisher in this yearâ€™s event. He crossed the line in 59:53:33, as runners and crews watched his headlamp approach in the night, tension building on if heâ€™d make it before time was up. He did, crossing the line just 6.5 minutes before the eventâ€™s 60-hour cutoff.

This year looked like it could be the year for a female Barkley Marathons finisher, which would have been a first in the eventâ€™s 36-year history. Among what we believe were eight women on the start line wasAndrea Larson, who twice finished fourth at theBandera 100kand earned her spot at the Barkley Marathons with a win at the 2022Barkley Fall Classicâ€” or the â€œBaby Barkley.â€																					
Also on the womenâ€™s roster, we learned as the race progressed, wasKatie Wright(U.K., lives in New Zealand), who, among her notable finishes, was one of the last four people standing at the 2019Big Dogâ€™s Backyard Ultra.																					
In the womenâ€™s ranks were the U.K.â€™sNicky SpinksandJasmin Paris. Spinks and Paris each seemed ideal candidates to be the first woman to complete the Barkley. In 2022, Paris was the first woman in a decade to complete three of the five loops inside of 40 hours â€” to be awarded a Fun Run finish. In 2019, Spinks, alongsideStephanie Caseof Canada, completed one loop and retired midway through the second loop amid deteriorating weather conditions.

This year, as always, there were casualties in the field from the get-go, with Keith Dunn Tweeting:â€œAndrea KooimanandEBdid not complete loop one after getting off course and ending up at Gobey Church (a runner made the same mistake last year). Gutted for both of them.â€																					
Paris put in a supreme effort, bettering her 2022 performance by finishing three loops in 35:40, down from her previous best of 39:49. She had a strong start, finishing loop 1 in a time of 8:36. She was back at the finish of loop 2 with 21:13 on the clock, and following a tight turnaround, was out on loop 3 by 21:27 elapsed. She completed the loop just 20 minutes inside the cut-off to continue â€” also bagging another Fun Run finish â€” but was ultimately timed out on loop 4, returning with nine pages gathered within the allotted time.																					
Spinks completed the first loop in 11:35 but was ultimately timed out on loop 2. She arrived in good spirits at the finish of the loop.																					
Once again, there was no womenâ€™s finisher at the 2023 Barkley Marathons, but Jasmin Paris continued to push the womenâ€™s race a little closer to the mark. Paris is only the second woman ever to set out on loop 4, withSue Johnstonhaving been the first in 2001.

2023 Transgrancanaria Classic 128k Results: Andreu Simon Wins, Courtney Dauwalter Dominates,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-transgrancanaria-classic-128k-results,"The 2023Transgrancanaria Classic 128k, the queen race of the Transgrancanaria (TGC) festival of races, started at midnight local time on Saturday, February 25, in Las Canteras on the northeastern coast of the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. Over the next 30 hours, more than 600 runners attempted to cover the 79.5 miles (128 kilometers) and 23,160 feet (7,060 meters) of vertical gain before reaching the outskirts of the town of Maspalomas on the islandâ€™s southern shore.																					
The race kicked off the 2023 Spartan Trail World Championships series in the Ultra category alongside the TGC Marathon event in the Trail category.																					
After a cold and cloudy night, there were some hours of great running conditions before things got hot around GaraÃ±on at 90k. After some early front running byClaudia Tremps(Spain) andJazmine Lowther(Canada),Courtney Dauwalter(U.S.) would go onto yet another dominating win in the womenâ€™s race, with Lowther and Tremps running in second and third, respectively, for the final three-quarters of the race.																					
While the women quickly sorted into their final finishing order for the podium, the menâ€™s race saw many of its early leaders eventually withdraw from the race. That said,Andreu Simon(Spain) was always near the front on the way to his win, whileMiguel ArsÃ©nio(Portugal) andTyler Green(U.S.) were patient and took advantage of the attrition in the menâ€™s race to finish second and third, respectively.																					
Read on for more details on how the womenâ€™s and menâ€™s races played out.

While she didnâ€™t lead from the very start, this was yet another dominating performance from the U.S.â€™sCourtney Dauwalterafter winning this yearâ€™s Transgrancanaria Classic 128k by nearly two hours over the next woman. Spainâ€™sClaudia Trempsinstead set the pace through Tenoya at 11k, whileJazmine Lowtherof Canada took over the womenâ€™s lead before Arucas at 19k.																					
However, at both points, Dauwalter was just a minute off the lead, and she took a lead that sheâ€™d never relinquish on the climbing-heavy stretch on the way to Teror at 31k. Her three-minute lead at Teror grew to 31 minutes by Artenara at 66k, just a bit over the midway point of the race. By the time she reached the finish in Maspalomas, she had an hour and 46 minute lead on the next woman.																					
Along the way, Dauwalter unfailingly moved up in the overall standings, going from the mid-20s in the early going to the mid-teens at mid-race to seventh overall at the finish.

Behind Dauwalter, a dynamic race emerged for second, and it was one that would last all the way to the finish line. At Arucas, 19k in, Lowther ran in second less than a minute ahead of Tremps before building a three-minute advantage on Tremps at Teror. Both runners were back together again at Fontanales (43k) and essentially together at El Hornillo (53k). From there, Lowther built margins of two minutes at Artenara (66k) and then 10 minutes at Tejada (78k).																					
Things would stay dynamic because, after that, Tremps closed that to less than seven minutes at GaraÃ±on (90k). Then Lowther started rebuilding that gap to 12 minutes at Tunte (102k) and almost 17 minutes at Ayaguares 114k) â€¦ but Tremps more than cut that gap in half in the final 14k to the finish, with Lowther taking second by just under seven minutes and Tremps coming home in third. Phew, talk about some great push and pull between Lowther and Tremps for the womenâ€™s podium positions.																					
Katharina Hartmuthof Germany didnâ€™t go out with the eventual womenâ€™s podium. She was already five minutes behind Tremps at the first aid station and 10 to 15 minutes behind her for much of the race, being only 12 minutes behind the Spaniard at Tejada. While Hartmuth kept moving up in the overall field, Tremps kept growing her lead over the German over the raceâ€™s final 50k, with Hartmuth finishing fourth woman.																					
Belgiumâ€™sDominique Van Mechgelen, who lives on Gran Canaria, was with Hartmuth at the first checkpoint 11k in but slowly lost ground to the German, falling as far back as 53 minutes behind her at GaraÃ±on, before eventually taking the fifth womenâ€™s position, 44 minutes behind Hartmuth.

While most of the women in the top 10 at the raceâ€™s first checkpoint at 11k ended up in the top 10, that was NOT the case in the menâ€™s race. Wow. Of the 14 men to be within about two minutes of the lead at 11k, six would go on to drop out, including the top three at that point:Abel Carretero(Spain),Jia-Sheng Shen(China), andFotios Zisimopoulus(Greece).																					
Now, the guy in fourth at that very early interval â€“ Spainâ€™sAndreu Simonâ€“ well, youâ€™ll continue hearing about him. He, countryman and past Transgrancanaria champPau Capell, and Romaniaâ€™sRaul Butaciwere all within a minute of the lead, with Franceâ€™sArthur Joyeux-Bouillon, Switzerlandâ€™sJonas Russi, the U.S.â€™sTyler Green, and Romaniaâ€™sIonel Manolerounding out the top 10 in the early going.																					
By 30k at Teror, Zisimopoulus, Carretero, Simon, Butaci, and Shen were all still within roughly a minute of the lead, with Capell,Mario Olmedo(Spain),Miguel ArsÃ©nio(Portugal), Green, and Russi all between three and five minutes off the front. Things were much the same at Fontanales (43k), with the same top five all within just over a minute and, really, all together except Butaci a bit over a minute back, and that next group of ArsÃ©nio, Green, Capell, and Olmedo having condensed at just over five minutes off the lead.

Just 10k later at El Hornillo, Butaci shot into the lead, with Carretero, Shen, and Simon chasing 30 seconds back and Zisimopoulus being dropped three minutes off the front. The chase group of Olmedo, ArsÃ©nio, Green, and Capell were now eight to nine minutes back. Butaci continued to push the pace to Artenara, putting an 80-second gap on Simon, 3.5 minutes on Carretero, and 5.5 minutes on Shen, while Zisimopoulus was about to get caught by the chase group led by Green and Capell around 11 minutes off the lead.																					
And then, not long after the sun came up, the race blew up. Simon took the lead on the way to Tejeda (78k) and put 2.5 minutes on Butaci before the aid station with Carretero just 3.5 minutes back, but Carretero would withdraw from the race there. Ten minutes off the lead, ArsÃ©nio was clear in fourth, with Green, Shen, Manole, and Capell in fifth through eighth at 12 to 14 minutes back, with Zisimopoulus and Olmedo 19 and 23 minutes back. However, both Shen and Olmedo would also drop in Tejeda.																					
Moving to Tunte at 102k, the menâ€™s race would continue to see more post-dawn carnage, with Manole (who was fifth upon arrival at Tunte) and Olmedo both withdrawing there. With those drops, Simon lead the race by 4.5 minutes over ArsÃ©nio. Butaci and Green sat 13.5 and 16.5 minutes off the lead in third and fourth. And Capell had just over a minute lead onJoaquin Lopezof Ecuador for fifth.

A full 114k into the race at Ayaguares, Simon had a nearly five-minute lead on ArsÃ©nio. Andreu Simon would go on to win with that same five-minute lead over Miguel ArsÃ©nio. While those two guys were flying, Raul Butaci was pulling his parachute. Tyler Green flew past him on the way to Ayaguares before taking third some 20 minutes out of second, but nine minutes clear of Butaci in fourth. Meanwhile, Pau Capell and Joaquin Lopez came into Ayaguares neck-and-neck, but Capellâ€™s experience paid off, with him edging out the Ecuadorian by eight minutes over the final 14k to take fifth.

2023 Black Canyon 100k Results: Anthony Costales and Keely Henninger Lead Record-Breaking Day,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-black-canyon-100k-results,"The 2023Black Canyon 100kkicked off in a chilly 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and while the competition in both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s races was hot and heavy, the temperatures remained a little lower than in previous years. This surely contributed to the fastest-ever Black Canyon 100k, which saw new course records set by bothAnthony CostalesandKeely Henninger.																					
Three men finished underSage Canadayâ€™srespected 2016 course record, and the first two women both came in underBrittany Petersonâ€™s2021 record, which was indicative of the depth of the field battling it out forWestern States 100Golden Tickets.																					
The Black Canyon 100k begins in Mayer, Arizona, and takes in 5,100 feet of climb and 7,000 feet of downhill on generally dry desert trails to finish at the Emery Henderson Trailhead outside of Phoenix.

Anthony Costalesset a 19-minute course record, finishing in 7:33. Costales placed fifth at the Black Canyon 100k last year after a difficult day and said in his finish line interview, â€œLast year after finishing, I did not think I was coming back. I was like, â€˜I do not want to do that again!â€™â€ He said he was drawn back by the standard of competition he saw appear on the entrants list, particularly when he sawTom Evans(U.K.) had signed up and said, â€œI was really excited to go and race against one of the worldâ€™s best.â€																					
Cole Watsonwas the early race leader, with Evans the first to make a counterattack. Social media indicates that Evans led the race into the Black Canyon City aid station at mile 37.5, but Costales emerged from the aid station in first place, having patiently moved up through the field.																					
Costales was more than five minutes clear of Evans by Doe Springs, mile 58.6, having extended the gap by a minute from the previous aid station.Janosch Kowalczyk(Germany) was now just two minutes back from Evans and applying pressure, having gained four minutes on Evans in the previous seven miles.																					
Anthony Costales (right) on his way to winning the 2023 Black Canyon 100k.																					
Costales seemed to gain momentum as he powered the home stretch to finish in a record-breaking 7:33. Evans came in second in 7:37, still 15 minutes under Canadayâ€™s course record, with Kowalczyk third in 7:40. Cole Watson made it four men under eight hours, finishing in 7:59.																					
Noah Dusseauwas the fifth man home, just a few minutes later, in 8:02.																					
Costales tentatively accepted his Golden Ticket, and with Evans already having secured a place at this yearâ€™s edition of the Western States 100, the second menâ€™s Golden Ticket fell to Kowalczyk.

Triathlete and track cyclistHeather Jacksonis very new to the trail running world, but a lack of experience didnâ€™t show as she was the early pacesetter in a very fast and close womenâ€™s race. She narrowly ledIda Nilsson(Sweden, lives in Norway) in second andKeely Henningerin third at mile 31.																					
The top three women came into the Table Mesa aid station at mile 51 within seconds of one another â€” this time Henninger leading, followed immediately by Jackson, with Nilsson just seconds behind. Henninger cooled off with some ice and was out first, followed by Nilsson, then Jackson. All three were ahead of course-record pace.																					
At Doe Springs, mile 58.6, Henninger and Jackson were just 14 seconds apart at the front, but Henninger managed to pull away in the closing miles and cruised home in 8:45, taking three minutes off Brittany Petersonâ€™s 2021 course record and claiming the first womenâ€™s Golden Ticket. Henninger said at the finish, â€œThat race was awesome, and I knew the course super well, and I knew what I could sustain.â€

Anna Kaciustook the womenâ€™s fourth position, and Nilsson ultimately arrived to the finish in fifth place.																					
As Jackson already has a spot for the 2023 Western States 100, the second Golden Ticket fell to Morgan, who accepted it decisively.

2023 Tarawera by UTMB 102k Results: Kiwis Nancy Jiang and Daniel Jones Victorious,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-tarawera-by-utmb-102k-results,"They say that neither rain nor shine will stop the mail carriers of the world from delivering their mail, and the same can be said for ultrarunners.																					
While a significant storm about a week before the 2023Tarawera by UTMB 102krace weekend caused a landslide and other issues around the remote course based in the city of Rotorua, on the North Island of New Zealand, the race organization rerouted the course last minute and the show went on.																					
The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on Tarawera for the last few years, with the 2021 event held for local runners only due to the countryâ€™s borders being closed, and the 2022 event canceled due to a country-wide outbreak. For 2023, New Zealandâ€™s borders are reopened and Tarawera once again welcomed runners from far and wide.																					
While going on a decade, the 100-kilometer race at Tarawera has attracted international talent, itâ€™s also been a Western States 100 Golden Ticket Race for a few years, wherein for this year two women and two men are awarded entry to the 2023 Western States 100.																					
All of these variables collided early Saturday morning, February 11, as 776 runners streamed off an improvised starting line on the northern shores of Lake Okataina, east of Rotorua, heading for the Rotorua finish line.																					
Some 100 kilometers of racing later, beginning in cool, humid weather and running through warm and still humid weather with peeks of sun through a decent cloud bank all day, it was the national talent that ran best. New Zealandâ€™sNancy Jiangtopped the womenâ€™s race andDaniel Jonestook home the menâ€™s win.																					
Read on for more details about both races.

If the 2023 Tarawera 102k womenâ€™s race is a predictor of what this year is going to look like for womenâ€™s trail ultrarunning, we all had better pay attention. It was the womenâ€™s race that stayed competitive wire-to-wire, with the top five women finishing within 12 minutes of championNancy Jiangof New Zealand. This marks the closest womenâ€™s race in the decade-plus of Tarawera 102k history â€” by a long way.																					
The U.S.â€™sAmanda Bashamwas the early race leader, pushing what other women called a hot early pace. She led for roughly the raceâ€™s first third before slowing to an ultimate eighth place. Then, before the raceâ€™s marathon mark,Stephanie Austonof Australia assumed the race lead. But a passel of women stayed close all day.																					
At the final checkpoint, around six kilometers from the finish, Jiang and Auston ran together, a couple of meters separating them, with Jiang at the helm. When Jiang crossed the line in victory, only 90 seconds of daylight separated her and second-place Auston.																					
Jiang is a multi-time champion of New Zealandâ€™s iconic Kepler Challenge, and in 2022 she was 22nd at the CCC in France. Preceding Austonâ€™s second place at the Tarawera 102k by less than two months was a victory at the 2022 Ultra-Trail Kosciuszko by UTMB 100k in her home country.																					
Spainâ€™sAroa Siospent the entire race running within the womenâ€™s top five. Vacillating all race between second and fifth positions, Sio crossed the line in third place and just about three minutes behind second. Sio appears primed for another big year, following up on her strong 2022, which included takingthird at the Canyons by UTMB 100k, 12th at the Western States 100, and eighth at UTMB.																					
Following the womenâ€™s podium only five minutes later was fourth placeAnna McKennaof Australia, and Chinaâ€™sFu-Zhao Xiangin fifth, the pair only separated by another two minutes.																					
At the time of this articleâ€™s publishing, it was not publicly known who (if anyone) in the womenâ€™s race has yet accepted the Western States 100 Golden Tickets. Two are given out, runners have a couple of weeks to decide if theyâ€™d like to accept them, and the tickets roll down as far as fifth place as needed. Among the top five women, no woman already has a Western States 100 entry by other means.

I was really rooting for New Zealandâ€™sDaniel Jonesto get a Western States 100 Golden Ticket, as heâ€™s been trying for four races to earn one. Jones intended to race the 2022 Tarawera 102k, but it was canceled last minute due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its Golden Tickets were doled out at other events in the series. Then, a few months later, in April of 2022, he took 10th in a tough day at the Canyons by UTMB 100k, another Golden Ticket Race for which he traveled to the U.S. to participate in.																					
After not earning a ticket there, he stayed on in the U.S. to attempt another shot at a ticket, mistaking the 2022 Lake Sonoma 100k for a Golden Ticket Race. He won the race, but heartbreakingly learned after the fact that it wasnâ€™t part of the series â€” in all fairness the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile was a Golden Ticket Race for many years â€” and went home without that Golden Ticket.																					
All this is to say that when the menâ€™s race fired off in the 2023 Tarawera 102k, I couldnâ€™t help but really want Jones to earn one of those tickets. But some 102 kilometers worth of earning he would have to do.																					
Sam McCutcheon, who is from New Zealand, but who lives in the U.K., was the raceâ€™s early pacesetter. Like Amanda Basham on the womenâ€™s side, McCutcheon largely set the pace for the men through the eventâ€™s first third. However, there were always other guys right there, running within seconds of the lead.																					
After the 38k aid station, Jones and the U.S.â€™sHayden Hawksshook free of McCutcheon as well as the rest of the menâ€™s field, settling into what looked like roughly a shared leadership of the pole position. According to the pair, they are friends and have been training partners over the last year both when Jones traveled to the U.S. and when Hawks traveled to New Zealand. There was some leapfrogging, we believe, before Jones was able to shake free of Hawks too, to lead the race solo.																					
At the penultimate aid station, 87k into the race, Jones led solo with a five-minute gap on Hawks, which he extended to more than 14 minutes by the finish line. We understand that Jones is eagerly accepting his Western States 100 Golden Ticket.																					
Hawks crossed the line in second, saying afterward on social media that heâ€™d run his own best race and was happy with his performance. Hawks already has an entry to the Western States 100 courtesy of asecond place there last year, which means the second Golden Ticket rolls down the finisherâ€™s list.																					
Ryan Montgomeryfrom the U.S. raced smart, shadowing those pressing at the front but setting their own sustainable pace. That meant running in the back half of the top 10 for the raceâ€™s first third, moving up to podium position around the close of the raceâ€™s second third, and holding that spot through the finish line, some 40-plus minutes behind the leader. Montgomery, who identifies as nonbinary but who raced in the menâ€™s race, wrote on social media that they are excited about earning that Western States 100 Golden Ticket.																					
McCutcheon ultimately rolled across the line in fourth place, and Australiaâ€™sRhett Gipsontook fifth.

2023 Winter Spine Race Results: Racers Endure Low Visibility, High Winds, and Waist-Deep Snow,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-winter-montane-spine-race-results,"The 2023Spine Racewinter edition saw a record number of participants and a stacked field of competitors on the course, includingEoin Keith(Ireland),Elaine Bisson(U.K.),Damian Hall(U.K.),Kim Collison(U.K.),Eugeni Rosello(Spain),Doug Zinis(U.K.),James Leavensley(U.K.),Ellie Eccles(U.K.), andSharon Gayter(U.K.). In all, 500 racers from 22 countries showed up across the eventâ€™s five races.																					
TheÂ  Spine Race is designed to be grueling, and this yearâ€™s British winter didnâ€™t disappoint. Blizzards, 70-mile-per-hour winds, waist-deep snow, and low overnight temperatures all took their toll on race participants. Nevertheless, stiff competition fueled the runners, and several of the eventâ€™s races saw course records smashed by minutes and even hours.																					
â€œBritainâ€™s Most Brutalâ€ event takes place along the 268-milePennine Way National Trail, which stretches from the Peak District in England to the Scottish borders. Participants run unsupported: they carry all their supplies (food, sleep system, clothing, and medical supplies), and no pacers are allowed.																					
Additionally, the route isnâ€™t marked, and racers navigate the trail on their own. As weâ€™ll see, this fact played heavily into this yearâ€™s final results.																					
The weeklong event and its five races extend for 2023 from January 15 to January 22.																					
In this article, we share highlights from four of the eventâ€™s five races:

The titular event, which travels all 268 miles of the Pennine Way, was full of drama asJack ScottandDamian Hallbattled for first place in the menâ€™s race. It came down to the wire on the last day, with the two racers neck and neck as they crossed the finish line. Unfortunately for Scott, a navigational error in the dead of the night led to a 48-minute time penalty when he strayed off course.

Race directors awarded Scott a seven-minute time credit when he stopped to assist a runner in distress, but the total 41-minute time addition was too much for the 28-year-old to overcome. Hall took the top honors in 84 hours,Â  36 minutes, and 24 seconds, and Scottâ€™s second-place finish clocked 85:16:24 once his penalty time was added.

This yearâ€™s race represents the fourth attempt for Hall. The accomplished runner, who also puts in behind-the-scenes work at the Spine Race, suffered an injury during last yearâ€™s race. â€œI wanted to come back and do better. Itâ€™s been an incredible race,â€ Hall shared.																					
â€œI thought we were going to have a nice time running together,â€ Hall said in reference to the younger Jack Scott. â€œBut every time I saw Jack, he seemed to keep pushing harder.â€																					
At 28, Scottâ€™s just getting started.																					
â€œRunning has become something within me that I now canâ€™t remove. I want to see how far and how fast I can run,â€ he told Spine Race representatives.																					
The competition was certainly effective in pushing both runners to excellence. Their finish smashes the previous male course record, set by AmericanJohn Kelly, by almost three hours.Jasmin Parisstill holds the womenâ€™s and overall course record of 83:12:23.																					
Joe Oâ€™LearyandDouglas Ziniswere over 10 hours behind with a third-place tie in 96:50:53.

Claire Bannwarth(France) took top honors for the women, finishing under 100 hours with 97:39:58. She established an untouchable lead from the early stages of the race and finished almost 24 hours before second-placeHannah Rickman(U.K.), who finished in 121:23.																					
Bannwarth was the winner of last yearâ€™s Kullamannen Ultra 100 Mile and also placed 21st at the 2022 UTMB.

Bradley came out strong in the raceâ€™s opening hours, but a fall before Bellingham crushed his spirits in a big way. Teaming up with Hutchinson in the final stages was the key to eventual success. Irelandâ€™sJohn Murraycompleted the menâ€™s podium in 72:16:52.

â€œIt was a tough day and night on the trail. Iâ€™m just relieved to get through it. The real damage was done coming off Pen-y-Ghent. I battled through headwinds, blizzards, and experienced a complete whiteout. At one point, I couldnâ€™t see my feet,â€ the racer shared in a press release. According to other racers on the course, Harris was unstoppable despite the heinous conditions.

â€œIâ€™d not planned for the podium. My aim was just to finish the race in one piece, so itâ€™s absolutely amazing that Iâ€™ve won and beaten the course record,â€ the U.K. racer said. â€œThe wind was horrendous. Every time the wind blew, I was getting pushed across the moors.â€																					
The Sprint was a good event for U.K. racers all around.Kim KennedyandJulie Taylortook second and third for the home nation (12:47:34 and 13:47:52, respectively).

2023 Bandera 100k Results: A Record for Dauwalter, Colt Gallops Away,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-bandera-100k-race-results,"Hundreds of runners toed the line at the 2023Bandera 100kon Saturday, January 7, all vying for four total Golden Tickets to the 2023Western States 100.

Early rain turned the Bandera course into sludge, then afternoon sunshine cooked it into a hard, hoof-printed jigsaw puzzle. The Bandera course is famously punishing: â€œEverything cuts, stings, or bites,â€ as race organizers say, and technical rock gardens proliferate.Joe â€œStringbeanâ€ McConaughyunfortunately landed in the DNF bucket due to a rumored Achilles injury sustained in that rock.

The Leadville, Colorado, legend didnâ€™t falter down the stretch, running a strong final lap to seal the win and the record.

JP Giblinfollowed, a strong second in 8:29, and accepted his Golden Ticket with no indecision. Twenty-nine-year-oldCanyon Woodwardcrossed the line in third. Woodward didnâ€™t start the 2023 Bandera 100k as a favorite by any means, but led a substantial amount of the race and hung with the overall leaders throughout.																					
Elsewhere, 26-year-oldChris Myerstook fourth in his first-ever official 100k.

2023 Hardrock 100 Lottery Results,https://www.irunfar.com/2023-hardrock-100-lottery-results,"Congratulations to all the runners who were chosen for the 2023Hardrock 100!																					
The Hardrock 100 is a 100-mile race bearing 33,000 feet of climbing that goes in a loop around Coloradoâ€™s gorgeous San Juan Mountains, starting and finishing in the small town of Silverton. The course regularly visits altitudes above 13,000 feet and boasts several climbs exceeding 4,000 vertical feet. The event alternates directions on its loop each year, with the 2023 event heading in the counterclockwise direction.																					
The Hardrock 100 has one of the most difficult lotteries to enter the run â€” in part because the qualifying races which you have to finish in order to enter the event lotto themselves are all notoriously challenging, and in part because, for this year, some 2,414 people vied for the eventâ€™s 146 spots.																					
In this article, we attempt to distill the complicated lotto process and highlight those runners who we expect will make a speedy lap around the San Juans at the front of those 146 very lucky participants.

The Hardrock 100 lottery is complicated, so setting the stage with the parameters of this yearâ€™s lotto gives context for the rest of this article.																					
The 2023 Hardrock 100 will start 146 runners. As mentioned at the outset of this article, 2,414 people applied for the lottery. This is significantly up from the 2022 lotto which had 1,916 applicants.																					
The 2023 lottery was divided into two categories, the Never Finished and Finished divisions:																					
For 2023, the event chose 73 runners from each category.																					
For the 2022 event and beyond, the organization adopted a gender policy to help account for the historic underrepresentation of women in the Hardrock 100. The policy states that the event will start at least the percentage of women who apply for the lotto. For 2023, 19.7% of the lotto applicants were women, so 29 of the 146 starters will be women for 2023. The organization allotted 18 of those spots to the Never Finished category and nine of those spots to the Finished category.																					
Historically, several runners are chosen ahead of time by the run director,Dale Garland, and announced among the names chosen in the lottery. The run organization indicated Garland chose six runners for 2023, and those entries were applied to their respective categories.																					
Returning champions are given entrance to the event. The 2022 womenâ€™s championCourtney Dauwalterhas accepted that entry, while 2022 menâ€™s champKilian Jornetdeclined it. Dauwalterâ€™s entry comes from the Finished category.																					
There are four runners whose 2022 entries were deferred to 2023, and whose entries were applied to their respective categories.																					
All told, it looks like the lotto selected 135 runners for 2023, with the 11 remaining entrants Daleâ€™s picks, the reigning womenâ€™s champion, and the 2022 deferments.																					
The chances of a runner gaining entry to Hardrock depend upon which division of the lotto they are in and how many tickets they have in the lotto. TheHardrock 100 websiteâ€™s lottery pageexplains the details and nuances, but in short, tickets are gained through previous finishes as well as volunteer service to the organization.																					
In addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into four division- and gender-specific waitlists.																					
Even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is competitive in nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit upon which the Hardrock 100 prides itself. In the rest of this article, we document the women and men who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main contenders. We also mention who is on a waitlist with a reasonable chance to get in.

As mentioned above, just about the only way to gain automatic entry to the Hardrock 100 is by winning. The 2022 womenâ€™s champion Courtney Dauwalterwill be back to defend her title. Below are the notable women who were chosen in the 2023 lottery as well as the defending champ, listed in alphabetical order:

2022 Trail World Championships 80k Results: Peterman and Lâ€™Hirondel Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-trail-world-championships-80k-results-peterman-and-lhirondel-win,"This yearâ€™s much anticipatedTrail World Championships, now part of the combinedWorld Mountain and Trail Running Championships, was very different from the usual European courses the event tends to visit. The course saw some of the worldâ€™s best battling it out over 78 kilometers of Thailand jungle, on a three-looped course taking in 4,807 meters (15,771 feet) of climbing and descending in the Doi Suthep-Pui National Park on the outskirts of Chiang Mai on Saturday, November 5.																					
The favorites for the individual win were Franceâ€™sBlandine Lâ€™Hirondel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), reigning Trail World Champion and this yearâ€™s CCC winner, for the womenâ€™s race	 and the U.S.â€™sAdam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), making his international debut and coming off a win at Western States 100, on the menâ€™s side.																				
There was also a team race in store, with strong contingents from France, Italy, Poland, and the U.S., to name but a few.																					
While the wins in the individual races went along predicted lines, there were some surprises along the way, including an off-the-charts comeback performance from Swedenâ€™sIda Nilsson(post-race interview) in second place in the womenâ€™s race, who made Lâ€™Hirondel work very hard for the win. On the menâ€™s side, Franceâ€™sNicolas Martinâ€™s(post-race interview) second place was especially impressive, his sixth time representing his country at this event shining through via his steady performance on a pressure-filled day.																					
The 80k race wasnâ€™t the only one run the past few days. You can also check out our results articles for the2022 World Mountain Running Championships Up and Down,2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill, and2022 Trail World Championships 40kraces.

Eight kilometers into the womenâ€™s race, the early pacemakers wereEmma Pooleyof Switzerland, reigning world championBlandine Lâ€™Hirondel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), and Swedenâ€™sIda Nilsson(post-race interview) â€” all running within seconds of one another. It was Nilsson who made the first move, and by 30k in she had established a lead. Lâ€™Hirondel pulled away from the others in second, just a minute back from Nilsson, leaving a sizeable gap to the rest of the field.																					
A long game of cat and mouse ensued between the two leaders, with Lâ€™Hirondel closing the gap to just 45 seconds at the 50k mark, but Nilsson pulling away again â€” coming through 60k more than three minutes ahead of the favorite, Lâ€™Hirondel, and looking the stronger of the two. The two still maintained a gap of more than 13 minutes to Spainâ€™sGemma Arenas(post-race interview), who had moved into third at point.

Lâ€™Hirondel had spoken about the course in herpre-race interviewand its challenging last section, and said that she planned to run prudently to hold something for the end. She was as good as her word, as on the last major climb â€” some 1,000 meters of ascent in 6k, from Huay Tung Tao up to the village of Ban Khun Chiang Khian â€” she not only passed but pulled seven minutes ahead of her rival.																					
Nilsson, now in second at 66k, was visibly working but still moving at a great pace and undeterred. Even more, she was 14 minutes clear of Arenas in third as she powered toward the finish.																					
Lâ€™Hirondel continued to pull away on the last stretch to the finish, a 12k descent, and romped home in a time of 8:22, to continue her reign as 80k Trail World Champion. Lâ€™Hirondel is more known for the marathon to 50k distance. She holds the course record for the 55k OCC, which she set last year, and herprevious Trail World Championships win in 2019was over the shorter 44k distance. This year she stepped up to the 100k distance with a win at CCC, and today she has once again demonstrated her versatility with a win in this hot and humid 80k jungle race.

Nilsson, who had set an incredible pace all day, showing that she still has it after two decades of representing her country, came home in 8:34 â€” well clear of the rest of the field. Her long career has included wins at The North Face 50 Mile in 2016 and 2017, the Zegama Marathon in 2018, and the Marathon du Mont Blanc in 2016. She has demonstrated today that there is still a lot more to come.

Gemma Arenas in third was rock solid all day. She came through 30k in fourth, about a minute and a half back from Emma Pooley. She moved into podium position shortly thereafter and maintained it all day â€” never quite closing the gap on the leaders, but not falling back either â€” and finished in a time of 8:46.																					
Hungaryâ€™sEszter Csillagdid what she does best, starting calmly and expertly moving up through the field all day. She finished fourth, just three minutes back from Arenas in 8:49, in a similar manner to her fifth-place finish at this yearâ€™s UTMB.																					
Germanyâ€™sRosanna Buchauerwas a minute and a half back in fifth, and Franceâ€™sAudrey TanguyandMarion Delespierrefinished together in sixth and seventh to seal the womenâ€™s team gold for France.																					
The Spanish team took second withMaite Maiora(eighth) andMarta Molist(15th) behind third-place Arenas. Team Italy came in third, and ninth-placeGiuditta Turiniwas followed byCamilla Spagnol(23rd) andAlessandra Boifava(25th).

Adam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)went into this race as the odds-on favorite, and he didnâ€™t disappoint. By 8k into the race, alongside Italyâ€™sAndreas Reiterer(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), he was already up front and setting the pace. By the 30k mark, Peterman was discernibly in front but still looked very calm and controlled â€” keeping just a few seconds clear of Franceâ€™sNicolas Martin(post-race interview), who had moved into second place. Just a minute back from the leaders, Reiterer and Spainâ€™sAritz Egearan together in third.

When the race reached the 50k mark in Ban Khun Chiang Khian village, after the second of three major climbs on this three-looped course that each topped out in this village, Peterman had started to pull away, extending the lead on Martin to three-and-a-half minutes.																					
By 60k, Reiterer had pulled away from Egea and was putting the pressure on Martin to hold on to second.

When Peterman reached the top of the third ascent, at 66k, he was 10 minutes ahead of Martin in second but visibly working hard against the heat. His downhill legs clearly had some muscle memory from the Western States 100 this summer, as he put another three minutes on the chaser in the last crushing descent to the finish, crossing the line as 80k Trail World Champion in a time of 7:15.																					
He adds this latest achievement to an already astonishing early career in ultrarunning. He has thus far won all six of his six ultramarathon starts â€” including last yearâ€™s Speedgoat by UTMB 50k and JFK 50 Mile and this yearâ€™s Chuckanut 50k, Canyons by UTMB 100k,andÂ Western States 100.

Nicolas Martin, who at times had looked under pressure to hold on to second, had a great last loop and finished eight minutes clear of Andreas Reiterer in 7:28. This was Martinâ€™s sixth Trail World Championships, and he matched his previous best result, asecond-place finish in 2016.																					
Reiterer, who is a relative newcomer to international trail racing, crossed the line in third in 7:36.																					
Spainâ€™sJosÃ© Fernandezand Aritz Egea came in fourth and fifth, helping to seal Spainâ€™s third-place team result. France took silver in the team competition, withThibaut Garrivier(sixth) andPaul Mathou(10th) joining teammate Nicolas Martin in the top 10.																					
In what has to be the biggest upset of the weekend of racing so far, Team USA took menâ€™s team gold, beating out perpetual team stars France and Spain, along with several other great teams on the day. This was thanks to Petermanâ€™s win, a seventh-place finish fromEric LiPuma, and a 14th-place finish forJeff Colt.

2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile Results: Lockwood, Hughes Hop Away With Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-run-rabbit-run-100-mile-results,"The 2022Run Rabbit Run 100 Milegot underway Friday, September 16. The â€œhares and tortoises,â€ as race organizers playfully frame competitors, started from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, at noon and 8 a.m. local time, respectively.																					
They then clambered through the day, night, and day again over an exhaustive roundtrip through the mountain bike trails and dirt roads encircling the town.																					
The circuit is nothing if not a rugged one: the race website says an entire eight miles of it are paved, 86 are trails, and the remainder consist of â€œrough jeep roads.â€ Over â€œabout 101.5 miles,â€ runners ascend some 20,391 feet â€” then descend it, of course.																					
This year, the weather featured heavily, with waves of rain heavily wetting the course, making it, at times, a humorous slip-and-slide.																					
For the hares, mainly consisting of highly attuned professionals, there was a lot at stake in the high-altitude race. Prize purses totaled $75,000, distributed equally between both the top-seven men and women. Each winner snagged $15,000, what together represent one of the highest prize purses in ultrarunning.																					
Menâ€™s leaders began to trickle into the finish line just before dawn on Saturday, September 17, with the top women a few hours behind.																					
In the menâ€™s competition,Richard Lockwoodprevailed, breaking away from the rest of the men at a little over halfway, and never failing to relinquish his lead at any timed checkpoint overArlen Glickin second place.																					
On the womenâ€™s side,Annie Hughestailed her competitors early before taking the lead about a third of the way through the race, methodically adding time on her chasers, and posting a decisive victory.

Richard Lockwoodnever wavered in the punishing 100 miler, at times appearing obstinate in his determination to lead Glick. At Long Lake, 24.3 miles in, the two ran together about a half minute off the lead pace and 10 seconds apart. Six miles later at Summit Lake, they were still in the thick of it together.																					
Richard Lockwood, 2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile champion.																					
But it wasAvery Collinswho got off to a hot start and led the field through about the halfway point. By Dry Lake at mile 44.5, heâ€™d built his lead on the field to over eight minutes. However, by 64 miles into the race, Lockwood was in lockstep with Collins, and would take over the lead and run away with things.																					
And by the second Long Lake timing point at 89 miles, Lockwood led by what might as well have been light years. No one ran within an hour of his pace by the finish line.																					
Nick Elson(Canada) did lead Glick late, by up to 79 seconds at the mile 95.8 mark, but couldnâ€™t hang on for the rousing final descent and finished third. Glick turned around hispodium finish at the Western States 100earlier this year, and Elson debuted well in his first 100 miler.																					
Samuel Collinstook fourth, and the other Collins, the early leader Avery, finished in fifth position.

As has become the case in every race she starts, this was theAnnie Hughesshow. Early on, Hughes let other women take the race out, staying in contact with the front of the pack before taking over the lead by one third of the way through. Her smart racing meant that, aid station by aid station, she grew her lead, splitting each section faster than the rest of the field.																					
By the finish line, she was some 100-plus-minutes clear of any other woman. This makes a trio of big victories in competitive events in 2022 for Hughes, withwins at the Cocodona 250 Mileand the High Lonesome 100 Mile in addition to here.

The rest of the top womenâ€™s field highlighted whatâ€™s so exciting about womenâ€™s ultrarunning right now, some six or seven women running nearly together in a tight pack well clear of the halfway mark. In that group included eventual top-five finishersTara Dower,Rachel Lemcke,Kasey Nobert, andMary Baughmanwho were just minutes apart for so long.																					
By the time the women returned to the start-finish line, the race for the top spots was still incredibly close, with second- and third-place Dower and Baughman under three minutes apart, and fifth- and sixth-place Lemcke andSarah Boughnerjust 21 seconds apart. Once a phenomenon only seen in much shorter races, the down-to-the-wire duels are now a thing of 100-mile mountain ultrarunning.

2022 Pikes Peak Ascent Results: Brinkman, Bonnet Prevail,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-pikes-peak-ascent-results,"The 2022Pikes Peak Ascentkicked off today at 7 a.m. local time. Toeing the start line on the streets of Manitou Springs, Colorado, amounts to a singular moment for the many who join the deeply competitive field each year. The objective is straightforward but daunting: climb the requisite 7,815 feet to the finish line just below the Pikes Peak summit at 14,050 feet faster than everyone else.The 13.32-mile courseup the well-known Barr Trail averages â€”averagesâ€” an 11% grade.Â And thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s been for 66 years.																					
As part of this yearâ€™s Golden Trail World Series (GTWS), this edition of the Ascent saw a stacked field take off under an unobstructed sun and cool temperatures. While thePikes Peak Marathonhas previously been featured in the GTWS, the switch was made to the shorter race this year to allow competitors better race again at the next GTWS race at theFlagstaff Sky Peaksin Arizona next weekend.																					
A wrinkle in the Pikes Peak Ascent prize purse: anyone who clocks a faster time than one the organizers set before the race banks an extra $10,000. This yearâ€™s times to beat were two hours even for men, and 2:21 for women. Briefly, it looked likeRÃ©mi Bonnethad a shot â€” but in the end, neither he nor womenâ€™s race winnerNienke Brinkmanclaimed it.

Nienke Brinkmancaptured the womenâ€™s title with a time just a few minutes back of the course record, whileMaude Mathysran hot on her heels while moving up in the second half of the race.																					
[In 2015, Mathys received a warning without suspension from the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases of Swiss Olympic for two positive tests for clomifene (previously clomiphene) after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.]																					
Brinkman finished in 2:27:26 to take the win. The Dutch sensation threatened at times to breakKim Dobsonâ€™s2012 course record, but finished moderately behind Dobsonâ€™s 2:24:58 mark. Dobson ran this year, finishing fifth.Sophia Laukliran six minutes back of Mathys and five minutes beforeAllie McLaughlinin taking third.

Near the midway point of the climb, Bonnet ledJoseph Grayby 45 seconds â€” a decent margin but far from comfortable. Eight men passed the trailside marker, â€œ1/2 way to Heaven,â€ shortly before Barr Camp within roughly three and a half minutes.																					
Gray dogged Bonnet, and some live feed trackers thought he could execute a pass near race end. But in the end, nobody could catch Bonnet, who won with a 2:07:02.																					
Drama did ensue behind Bonnet, asDaniel Osanzovertook Gray late and then gained some distance on the 38-year-old. Osanz clocked a 2:08:42, well behind Bonnet but also a half minute ahead of Gray, who finished third.Eli HemmingandFrancesco Puppirounded out the top five.

2022 IAU 100k World Championships Results: Hot and Okayama Prevail,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-iau-100k-world-championships-results,"For the first time since 2018, runners lined up for the 2022IAU 100k World Championships. This yearâ€™s edition, hosted by the town of Bernau, Germany, just northeast of Berlin, saw athletes from 42 countries tackle the flat-and-fast course on the wide Wandlitzer Chaussee, a wind-protected path through the neighboring forests. All of the race festivities centered around the cityâ€™s Bernau Bauhaus monument, with runners coming back through the start and finish line a total of 14 times.																					
Runners started out with a quick 2.5-kilometer opening lap before embarking on 13 laps of a triple out-and-back, 7.5k course with two tight 180-degree hairpin turns and one more gradual turn through the start/finish area. The unique format of this race allowed competitors to see each other potentially up to three times per lap. With minimal elevation gain on the course, it was a perfect setup to see records being broken.																					
In the womenâ€™s field, the favorites includedCamille ChaigneauandFloriane Hot, both of France. For the men, it seemed that the Japanese team would be dominant with previous 100-kilometer world record holderNao Kazamiamong the field. It was just a matter of how many team members the Japanese contingent could place on the podium, and who would be the one to try to knock them off.																					
In the 100-strong womenâ€™s field, it was the French team to watch with the top duo ofCamille ChaigneauandFloriane Hot. As the 2022 French 100-kilometer national champion, Hot had high ambitions for the race.																					
It was a fast start at the front of the field for Chaigneau, who quickly showed her intentions of taking control of the race. Just a little over halfway, at 55 kilometers, she led the field with a minute gap over Finlandâ€™sSatu LipiÃ¤inen.Courtney Olsenof the USA,Caitriona Jenningsof Ireland, andFloriane Hotof France all sat in the top five biding their time.																					
After 70 kilometers, the top five stayed nearly the same, with only Olsen slipping two positions down the leaderboard to fifth. The gaps remained small between the top five and the order unchanged for the next 10 kilometers before Hot surged to the lead at 80 kilometers, quickly putting a 36-second gap on teammate Chaigneau. A fading Chaigneau couldnâ€™t hold on to the relentless pace over the closing kilometers, eventually losing nearly a minute and a half to Hot but retaining her second position. Jennings made a valiant attempt to catch Chaigneau, but was only able to get within 45 seconds, and Olsen and LipiÃ¤inen raced hard to the end, finishing within eight seconds of each other for fourth and fifth.																					
Hotâ€™s time of 7:04:03 bested her previous 100-kilometer personal record of 7:42 by a lot and was a European record for the distance. Jenningsâ€™s third-place finish was a world record in the womenâ€™s 40 to 49 age group.																					
In the womenâ€™s team race, Team USA took home gold, with France and Japan earning silver and bronze, respectively. The top-three individual finishers of each team scored for the team event. Team USA was led by Olsenâ€™s fourth-place finish,Anna Kaciusâ€™sseventh place, andNicole Monetteâ€™s11th place.

All eyes were on the Japanese team heading into the event. With a strong four-man roster that includedNao Kazami, the previous world-record holder for the 100-kilometer distance, there was talk of a Japanese podium sweep. But with 133 runners starting, there were sure to be plenty of others to challenge the teamâ€™s dominance.																					
But it was a young 24-year-old French runner,Guillaume Ruel,setting to pace straight out the gap, and he maintained the lead until about 75 kilometers into the race. At that point, Japanâ€™sHarukiOkayamamoved into pole position, being tailed closely by Ruel.Jumpei Yamaguchikept the gap close in third while Kazami in fourth started to fade back. The two leaders would continue to run within a few minutes of each other through 85 kilometers with Yamaguchi sitting in third andPiet Wiersmafrom The Netherlands working his way into fourth.																					
As the kilometers wound down, Yamaguchi made a strong surge into second place, passing a fading Ruel in the final minutes. By the end, Wieisma and Norwayâ€™sSebastian Conrad HÃ¥kanssonwould also pass Ruel to place third and fourth with Ruel holding onto fifth.																					
Okayamaâ€™s winning time of 6:12:10 was over four minutes faster than his previous best of 6:16:44, and good enough to crown him the 2022 IAU 100k world champion.																					
In the menâ€™s team race, Team Japan took home gold, with France and South Africa respectively earning silver and bronze. Team Japan was led by first-place Okayama, second-place Yamaguchi, and sixth-place Kazami.

2022 UTMB Results: A Record for Jornet and a Runaway Win for Schide,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-utmb-results,"Thanks to HOKA for sponsoring iRunFarâ€™s coverage of the 2022 UTMB.																					
This yearâ€™sUTMBmenâ€™s race was billed as a likely showdown between two of the greats in menâ€™s ultrarunning,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) andKilian Jornet(post-race interview), with predictions that whoever came out ahead would also hold a new course record. And while it initially seemed that the race would play out as expected, with Walmsley and Jornet trading blows for the first 142 kilometers, it would beMathieu Blanchard(post-race interview) who made the final attempt to dethrone Jornet. But it was not to be, with Jornet breaking both previous course records, by a significant margin, in a time of 19:49:30.																					
The womenâ€™s side of the 2022 UTMB had an openness that perhaps fans had not felt in years. With no previous champions or clear favorites on the starting line, instead, we all ruminated about the 10 or 12 women with the potential to win or challenge for it. Even then, we all also noticed the deepening womenâ€™s field year over year, with this one likely requiring getting to the finish line quicker than was previously normal to secure a top-10 finish. From the start line,Katie Schide(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews) led aggressively, only relinquishing the lead for a handful of kilometers around daybreak during a rough patch, before getting her stomach under control and finishing with a time of 23:15:12 way in front of the rest of the field.																					
Covering 171.5 kilometers (106.5 miles), the UTMB creates an aesthetic and rugged loop around Mont Blanc in the Alps. Starting and ending in Chamonix, France, before paying a visit to both Italy and Switzerland, the loop has some 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) of elevation gain and loss. Arguably the most competitive trail ultramarathon of the year, UTMB is an event to behold. The final and most prestigious race of the week-long UTMB Mont-Blanc festival, it reliably draws top talent and some of the biggest crowds in the sport.																					
This year, 2,795 starters headed out from Chamonix at 6 p.m. on Friday, August 26, under cloudy skies and a sprinkle of rain, but with a forecast for potential rain and thunderstorms throughout the evening. The forecasted storms never really materialized, and runners enjoyed favorable weather throughout the race.																					
Jornet and Schide took similar paths to the win, both starting out strong before fading in the middle of the race and then surging to the front when it really mattered. And both saw strong challenges from second-place finishers, Blanchard andMarianne Hogan(post-race interview).																					
Several top runners would end up dropping out due to various ailments, including last yearâ€™s third-place womanMimmi Kotka(pre-race interview) and sixth-place manHannes Namberger(pre-race interview).

As expected, the men took the race out fast from the start on the relatively flat roads and trails from Chamonix to the village of Les Houches. Spainâ€™sPau Capell(pre-race interview), the 2019 UTMB winner, led a charging group through Les Houches, seven kilometers into the race, followed closely byMathieu Blanchard(post-race interview), a Frenchman living in Canada, andJia-Ju ZhaoandGuo-Min Deng, both of China. All the top contenders were in a massive chase pack, settling in for the long night and day ahead.																					
It didnâ€™t take long forJim Walmsley(pre-race interview) of the USA to make his intentions for this yearâ€™s race clear, coming into Saint-Gervais, at 20 kilometers into the race, in the lead, looking strong and relaxed.Kilian Jornet(post-race interview) and Capell were just seconds behind with Deng, Zhao, and AmericanZach Miller(post-race interview) making up a chase group half a minute in arrears. They were followed by FrenchmanGermain Grangier, Blanchard, FrenchmanThibaut Garrivier, andYan-Qiao Yunof China.																					
Unsurprisingly, by Les Contamines, 31 kilometers into the race, it was shaping up to be a showdown between Walmsley and Jornet. They came into the aid station together looking relaxed, Walmsley taking the time to high-five fans, and were shortly on their way into the night together. Capell and Miller came in just 30 seconds back, and Grangier rounded out the top five, just a minute behind them.																					
A notable withdrawal around this time due to physical issues is last yearâ€™s second-place finisher, FrenchmanAurÃ©lien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-race interview).																					
Climbing over the high Col du Bonhomme, 43 kilometers in, Walmsley, Miller, Jornet, andTom Evans(pre-andpost-race interviews) of the U.K. shared the lead. With 1,160 meters (3,800 feet) of climbing down just on this one climb, everyone in the group looked relaxed and was moving well. Capell was just 90 seconds back, trying not to let the elastic to the front group snap in the dark of the night on the run over to Col du Bonhomme before the long descent into the remote French outpost of Les Chapieux.

The four leaders stayed together down to Les Chapieux, 50 kilometers into the race, where last yearâ€™s winner, FranÃ§ois Dâ€™Haene â€” not participating this year â€” was spectating and cheering on runners. Unfortunately, Capell had lost contact with the lead group over the previous section, coming into the aid station more than two minutes back. The rest of the top nine stayed relatively the same withErik Sorensonof the USA slotting in 10th for the first time.																					
Coming into Lac Combal, 66 kilometers into the race, after crossing country borders into Italy and traversing the most remote part of the course, Walmsley and Jornet had only slightly pulled away, their gap to Miller and Evans hung at a tenuous minute. All four looked strong, but it seemed like pre-race predictions of a two-man showdown were about to be realized.																					
Walmsley, with his arms and legs fully covered from the cold of the night but shirt front open, came into the town of Courmayeur, 80 kilometers in, solo and in the lead, but his gap on Jornet was just 80 seconds. Both men were moving well and left the aid station together after only a few minutes.																					
It was a significant 12 minutes before Evans and Miller came through, staying in Courmayeur for under three minutes. Blanchard, looking more relaxed than any of the previous four, was also in and out of the aid station quickly, 18 minutes off the lead. Known for his slower starts and late race surges, Blanchard appeared to know exactly what he was doing.																					
It was never a question of if Walmsley or Jornet would strike out on their own, it was just a matter of when. Walmsley was the first to throw down a serious acceleration, coming into Arnouvaz (97 kilometers) solo and with a 2.5-minute gap on Jornet. Both were in and out of the aid station quickly, looking strong and motivated. Blanchard also chose the trail between Courmayeur and Arnouvaz to make his move, coming into the Arnouvaz aid station in third, looking very controlled and 14 minutes behind the leaders.																					
He was familiar with that position in the race, having finished third in UTMB in 2021. He was also familiar with the race tactic of starting slower, letting the leaders fight it out early and tire themselves out, and then moving up as the fast starters dropped back. It had brought him success the previous year, and he was seemingly employing the strategy again. Miller and Evans continued to run near each other, what Evans would later refer to as a â€œbromanceâ€ that lasted over half the race, and both looked like they had less spring in their step than the men ahead of them.																					
Committed to making the move stick, Walmsley climbed the Grand Col Ferret at 102 kilometers with a strong powerhike and held a five-minute gap over Jornet. Seemingly unconcerned with his position, Jornet chatted in French with both spectators and volunteers before vanishing into the night. Moving faster and looking stronger over the col than the previous two men, Blanchard continued the chase in third 17 minutes back. Miller and Evans continued to work together to keep the gap manageable.																					
The gap between Walmsley and Jornet stretched even further to 14 minutes by the sleepy Swiss village of La Fouly, 112 kilometers into the race. Both men were running under course-record pace, and both looked calm and collected. Still running strong into La Fouly, Blanchard kept the leaders within reach.																					
But Walmsley was committed to stretching the elastic on the field as much as he could, coming through Champex-Lac at 125 kilometers with 13 hours and 40 minutes on the race clock, gaining even more time on the course record and moving strongly. Itâ€™s generally a bad idea to bet against Walmsley after heâ€™s put his mind to something, and after a fifth-place finish in 2017 and DNF in 2018 and 2021 at UTMB, his commitment to the race and move to Europe to train on the trails seemed to be paying off. But Walmsley is also known for going out fast and strong, and it doesnâ€™t always stick.

One could argue that Jornet was just biding his time, letting Walmsley burn his matches out front. However, there were times around this point in the race when Jornet just plain looked like he was working, enough so that we all began to wonder if the GOAT of trail running would have a crack in his armor today. However, by Trient at 142 kilometers, Jornet had decided to make his move, coming into the aid station in the lead.																					
But instead of seeing Walmsley behind him, it was a surging Blanchard, less than a minute back, that Jornet would have to now battle. It was a long 19 minutes before Walmsley would arrive, appearing to be in discomfort. The dynamic duo of Evans and Miller continued to run together, still holding the gap to the race leader at just over 30 minutes, as they had for much of the race.																					
As the kilometers ticked down, it was indeed a showdown between two men, except it was Blanchard challenging Jornet, with both men coming into Vallorcine at 153 kilometers together, well ahead of the course-record pace. With Walmsley slowly losing time to the leaders but still in third, eyes moved to Evans whoâ€™d finally dropped Miller after nearly a night and a day of racing side by side to see if he could make the pass.

By this time, it felt nearly inevitable that Jornet would run to the win and it was no surprise when he came into Tete aux Vents solo looking focused and fast with an 11-kilometer downhill run to the finish. Blanchard never gave up the chase, seven minutes back, while Evans passed a tired but â€œpumpedâ€ Walmsley to slot into third for the first time.																					
Jornet would finish with a course-record time of 19:49:30, besting both FranÃ§ois Dâ€™Haeneâ€™s 2014 record time (20:11:44) on a course that did not include the Pyramides Calcaires, a gnarly little climb and descent added to the UTMB course a few years back, and Capellâ€™s 2019 time (20:19:09), which did include those extra kilometers. This is his fourth win at UTMB. Just five minutes back, Blanchard would also come into the finishing chute under the previous course record in second place. An elated Evans rounded out the podium, a stellar finish for his first UTMB.																					
Walmsley came across the line in fourth, releasing the two DNF monkeys on his back and finishing the next step in his goal of ultimately winning this race someday. Miller, no longer on the comeback trail following surgery and recovery, but fully back, crossed the line in fifth place.																					
Most of the back half of the menâ€™s top 10 are runners who started slower and bided their time, moving up in the raceâ€™s second half, including Franceâ€™sBeÃ±at Marmissolle, Franceâ€™sArthur Joyeux-Bouillon,Jonas Russiof Switzerland, and Romaniaâ€™sRobert Hajnal. The final member of the menâ€™s top 10, however, is Franceâ€™sThibaut Garrivier, who went out hot and looked like he paid for it later, but ultimately held onto 10th place.

An American living in France and eighth-place finisher at UTMB in 2021,Katie Schide(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews)Â set out to make her mark on the race from the beginning, leading the womenâ€™s field after seven kilometers into Les Houches while being trailed closely by the trio ofMarianne Hogan(post-race interview) from Canada,Kaytlyn Gerbin(post-race interview) from the USA, andHillary Allenfrom the USA.																					
Schide grew the gap over the next 13 kilometers into Saint-Gervais. With only one hour and 48 minutes on the race clock, a truly raw opening effort, her lead over second place Hogan was already five minutes, and she had eight minutes on third placeAudrey Tanguy(pre-race interview) of France.Jocelyne PaulyandManon Bohard, both from France also, came through in fourth and fifth withMimmi Kotka(pre-race interview), a Swede living in Chamonix, just behind them in sixth.Fu-Zhao Xiang(pre-race interview) of China,Ragna Debats(pre-race interview), who is Dutch but lives in Spain, andAzara GarcÃ­a(pre-race interview) of Spain rounded out the top 10, running together 13 minutes behind Schide.

Keeping up her consistent and strong pace, Schide continued to increase her lead on the rest of the womenâ€™s field, coming into Les Contamines at 31 kilometers with 2:50 on the race clock. By then, sheâ€™d extended her lead on Hogan to over nine minutes, Tanguy to 12 minutes, and Bohard and Pauly to 15 minutes. Tanguy was probably relieved to make it past Les Contamines where she had dropped last year from severe stomach cramps. A visibly limping Kotka, who had challenged Courtney Dauwalter during last yearâ€™s UTMB during the early miles of the race before finishing third as Dauwalter won, came into Les Contamines nearly 20 minutes off the lead in sixth and would not continue.																					
Schide continued to smile coming through the Col du Bonhomme, at about a marathonâ€™s distance into the race, clearly enjoying her run through the night and appreciating the cheers of the spectators. Climbing one of the largest passes of the race only seemed to make her stronger. Her gap to Hogan and Tanguy had grown to about 20 minutes as the two chasers crested the col. The cheers from the enthusiastic French crowd brought smiles to both womenâ€™s faces as they passed through. The cheers continued for Bohard and Pauly, who were still running together.

The crowd at Les Chapieux, 50 kilometers in, was enthused to see Schide, erupting in huge cheers as she came in. While the gaps between the women in second through 10th grew and shrunk over the kilometers, Schideâ€™s gap on the field had only gone one direction so far: up. She was now more than 22 minutes up on second place Hogan. By the time Schide got to Lac Combal, 66 kilometers into the race, the gap was up to 25 minutes, and it would be an additional 20 minutes for Tanguy to arrive after that.																					
With 80 kilometers run, Schide came into Courmayeur flying, spending only eight minutes at the aid station approximately halfway into the race. The crowds were thrilled to see her, providing a warm and raucous welcome as she ran into the aid station looking smooth. But for the first time in the race thus far, Hogan had started to close the gap to the leader, whittling it down to just over 20 minutes. Smiling but with a stomach that couldnâ€™t handle gels anymore, she quickly drank a Coke and opted for pizza for fuel. The gap between the top two women and the rest of the field continued to grow, and it was over an hour before Tanguy, Pauly, and Gerbin ran through, and a few more minutes after them to the sixth woman,Emily Hawgood, of Zimbabwe, who lives in the USA.

While Schide had seemed unstoppable before Courmayeur, the tables seemed to turn over the next 17 kilometers to Arnouvaz as night turned to day. Schide came in with stomach issues, clearly in a rough spot, with Hogan hot on her heels, now only two minutes behind. Closing a gap of more than 18 minutes is a feat to be acknowledged, and a feisty and strong Hogan seemed energized by the coming of the day and the idea of leading the race for the first time.																					
A struggling Schide maintained her lead over the Grand Col Ferret at 102 kilometers, but it was down to a minute, and when the womenâ€™s leader arrived at La Fouly at 112 kilometers, it was Hogan instead of Schide for the first time, with a sizable six-minute gap. By Champex-Lac at 125 kilometers, it was still Hogan in the lead and well under course record pace, now with a 10-minute gap to second. But Schide wasnâ€™t about to give up, slowing down to let her stomach recover from its previous rough spell, and finally eating a cheese sandwich and starting to move well again.																					
One hundred miles is a long distance to race, long enough that runners can get through rough spells and rebound. And thatâ€™s exactly what Schide did, regaining the lead in Trient at kilometer 142, not only eliminating the 10-minute gap but putting an additional 10 minutes on Hogan. By Vallorcine at 153 kilometers, the gap between the top two was up to 41 minutes, with Hogan nursing a hurt left leg. By the time the pair reached the finish line in Chamonix, they maintained their one-two position with Schide having extended the gap to some 75 minutes.																					
It was another 35 minutes later that we saw the final member of the womenâ€™s podium arrive, Gerbin, who ran for much of the second half of the race in what she described as â€œno womanâ€™s land,â€ well in front of those behind her but out of contact with the lead. It was apparently a comfortable spot for her, though, as she held her position strongly, and crossed the finish line back in Chamonix like she could run plenty more kilometers if needed.

Pauly finished fourth, the successful conclusion of a focused day of racing.Eszter Csillag(post-race interview), who is from Hungary but lives in Hong Kong, moved up later on to take fifth. Emily Hawgood ran strong all day to set and maintain a very similar position of sixth place. Xiang held tight to seventh place with Spainâ€™s Aroa Sio just behind in eighth.

2022 OCC Results: AvilÃ©s and Merillas Lead Spanish Sweep,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-occ-results,"The 2022OCCrace started on Thursday, August 25 in OrsiÃ¨res, Switzerland, ran through Champex-Lac, Switzerland, and finished in Chamonix, France. Itâ€™s this OrsiÃ¨res, Champex-Lac, Chamonix point-to-point route that gives the race its abbreviated name. The OCC is 55 kilometers (34.2 miles), but with 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of elevation gain and a field numbering 1,200 runners.																					
Neither defending champion â€”Blandine Lâ€™Hirondel(France) norJonathan Albon(U.K.) â€” were back for this yearâ€™s race. Both instead will contest the longerCCCrace. Both also set course records last year in 5:45 and 5:02.

2022 TDS Results: Pommeret and ValmassoiÂ Run to Victory,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-tds-results,"All roads lead to Chamonix, France. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s sometimes felt this summer, and thatâ€™s how it is with all of theUTMBMont-Blanc festival group of races too. The 2022TDS, an acronym for Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, left from Courmayeur, Italy, at midnight local time on Tuesday, August 23. Some 1,600 runners lit the night on clockwise route back to Chamonix. The challenging 145-kilometer (90 miles) path totaled 9,100 meters (29,855 feet) of elevation gain on a course thatâ€™s been run since 2019.

Ludovic Pommeret(France) added another win to his rich UTMB festival history. Pommeret, age 47, started as far back as 25th some seven kilometers into the race and finally moved into the standalone lead near the 99k point. There would be no question of the raceâ€™s outcome the rest of the way. Pommeret finished in 18:37, spraying champagne around the finish area before backtracking to collect high fives.

His finish time compares favorably toErik-Sebastian Krogvigâ€˜s2021 18:49 win, though Pommeret did not approachPablo Villaâ€˜s2019 18:03 course record. Pommeret was third himself at TDS that same year, and coincidentally also in 18:37. He was sixth earlier this year at theWestern States 100in June and famouslywon the 2016 edition of UTMBwith a big comeback.																					
No one was close to Pommeret, butJoaquin Lopez(Ecuador) was just ahead of 26-year-oldElias Kadi(France) for second. The two finished in 19:32 and 19:49, respectively. Lopez was sixth at UTMB in 2019, but it was Kadiâ€™s first race in Chamonix.

2022 Leadville 100 Mile Results: Gallagher and Macdonald Notch Second Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-leadville-100-mile-results,"The latest edition of theLeadville 100 Milehas wrapped for 2022, leaving a host of ultrarunners with bragging rights and shiny new belt buckles for their efforts.																					
This event is among the most famous 100-mile trail races. Runners make their way through the Rocky Mountains of Colorado at elevations starting at 9,200 feet all the way up to thin-aired high point of Hope Pass at 12,508 feet.																					
The extreme elevation and altitude make breathing difficult and add exponentially to the fatigue athletes feel as they make their way through the course.																					
The race has been a staple of the ultrarunning community since its inception in 1983. This year, the customary shotgun blast sounded on Saturday, August 20, 2022, at 4:00 a.m. local time. A slew of contenders from previous years left the starting line, includingClare Gallagher, who won the only previous Leadville 100 Mile she had run, in 2016, as well asAdrian Macdonald, last yearâ€™s menâ€™s champion.																					
The Leadville 100 Mile trail race is known as the â€œRace Across the Sky.â€ It features elevations of more than 12,500 feet and sweeping views of the Colorado Rockies. Photo: Life Time																					
Adrian Macdonaldturned heads in 2021 when he won the race as a first-time 100-mile competitor. It was clear from the start that Macdonald was primed for a repeat win if he could hold it together.																					
All of the top 10 runners stayed close together through the first few miles of the race.																					
But as mile 30 approached, gaps began to develop in the pack, and leaders emerged who would keep pace in front throughout the rest of the day.																					
At the halfway mark, Macdonald had found the front of the pack and edged out a nearly 15-minute lead overTyler Andrewsin second place. Other racers includingJP Giblin,Ryan Kaiser, andChristopher Harringtonalso stood out in front.																					
That group kept its distance from the field for the remainder of the race. But Macdonald made consistent gains in the final quarter of the race that gave him a commanding lead coming into the finish. Macdonald crossed the finish line more than two hours before anyone else.																					
The race for the next three places stayed considerably tighter. Giblin finished second with Kaiser just about 14 minutes in tow. Andrews came through about 20 minutes later, followed by Harrington.

Back in 2016, Boulder, Coloradoâ€™s Clare Gallagher threatened to reset the Leadville 100 Mile course record in her first-ever 100-mile race. This year she came back to Leadville for the first time since then â€” and won again.																					
Gallagher topped the womenâ€™s field after sparring intensely withAddie Bracythroughout much of the run.																					
Gallagher and Bracy were neck-and-neck at the first split, running at an 8:33 pace together with only nine seconds between them. The pair traded the lead for a couple of checkpoints, but Bracy managed to pull ahead to gain about a six-minute lead on Gallagher at the 50-mile mark.																					
Gallagher, however, used the next six miles to pull back time and pass Bracy early in the second half of the course. At the 56.5-mile mark, the coin had flipped, and Gallagher led Bracy by a roughly six-minute margin. After that, Bracy found herself unable to continue and dropped out of the race, leaving Gallagher with a dominant lead over the pack, which she held until the end.																					
Gallagher finished at 19:37:57, more than two hours ahead of her nearest chaserAlisyn Hummelberg.																					
Third- through fifth-place finishersLindsey Herman,Roxanne Vogel, andMadeline Hirschfeldbrought the womenâ€™s top five all in under 24 hours.

2022 Sierre-Zinal Results,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-sierre-zinal-results,"[Editorâ€™s Note:On October 11, 2022, the organization behindSierre-Zinal released this statementregarding disciplinary proceedings for doping againstMark Kangogo, the winner of the menâ€™s race. The final menâ€™s ranking for the 2022 edition was suspended, pending the conclusion of these disciplinary proceedings.																					
On October 13, the organizationreleased another statement, in which they announced thatAndreu Blanesis the winner of the 2022 Sierre-Zinal menâ€™s race, saying â€œMark Kangogoâ€™s suspension is final. Athletics Integrity Unit informs us today that the athlete concerned â€˜admitted the infraction, accepted a sanction, and waived his right of appealâ€™.â€]																					
The 2022 World Mountain Running Association World Cup season hit the halfway point, with its sixth race, and the Golden Trail World Series progressed too, with its fourth series event, at the 2022Sierre-Zinal.																					
Run on storied trails in the Swiss high country each year since 1974, the ferocious 31-kilometer (19.2 miles) course consistently draws the worldâ€™s best mountain runners. The stacked field runs through the Swiss Canton (read: wine country region) of Valais, between the mountain villages of Sierre and Zinal. The compelling course kicks off on a steep climb, and then finishes on a careening downhill. The course gains 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) and loses 1,100 meters (3,600 feet).																					
Roll call at Sierre-Zinal often reads like an all-star lineup:Jairo Correa,Anna Pichrtova,Sally Goldsmith, andRicardo MejÃ­ahave highlighted tickets that regularly brim with world champion mountain runners, Olympians, and world record holders.																					
Todayâ€™s 2022 entry was no different:Maude Mathys(Switzerland) returned to vie for her fourth straight Sierre-Zinal win, whileKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway) was looking for his 10th title in Valais.																					
Hereâ€™s how the race shook out.																					
Mathys may have won the last three womenâ€™s Sierre-Zinal entries in a row, but that didnâ€™t impress the mountain running newcomer who took the field.																					
Kenyaâ€™sEsther Chesangleft every woman except Mathys in the dust, posting a 2:52:01 to win. She broke out fast but soon Mathys hounded her. The pair traded fastest splits throughout the middle of the race, but Mathys could not establish a lead. Despite flying through the descent thanks to her technical prowess, Mathys finished just 30 seconds behind the 27-year-old Chesang. At times, Mathys got close enough to see the Kenyan had she broken her concentration on the choppy trail.

KenyanPhiliares Kisang, the only woman to beat her countrywomanJoyce Njeruin any other World Cup race this year, took third in 2:58:00. She ran very closely with Mathys early, checking in just three seconds behind the Swiss runner at the first checkpoint of Ponchette at 58:17.

Njeru, meanwhile, posted a disappointing DNF. The rest of the field finished minutes behind the front three.																					
[In 2015, Mathys received a warning without suspension from the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases of Swiss Olympic for two positive tests for clomifene (previously clomiphene) after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.]

Kenyan-bornMark Kangogobroke the tape first on the menâ€™s side, finishing in 2:27:31. The 33-year-old came into the race fresh off breaking a course record at the last World Cup tour stop inThyon-Dixence, also in Switzerland, just last weekend, and he just missed turning the same trick at Sierre-Zinal: Jornetâ€™s 2019 mark is just under two minutes faster. [Updated October 13, 2022] Kangogo was later disqualified,as per this statement from Sierre-Zinal.																					
Spainâ€™sAndreu Blanesfinished second at 2:29:19 [Updated October 13, 2022] but was later awarded the win. No one came close to matching his pace on the back end of the course as he doggedly gained places. Also remarkably, Sierre-Zinal was only his second World Cup race this season	 at Thyon-Dixence, he took fourth.

And for the first time this year, Kenyaâ€™sPatrick Kipngenofinished somewhere other than first place in a World Cup race. Heâ€™d won all five previous events this season, some resoundingly. Kipngeno slated a respectable third place but faded late. Kangogo broke free from him after the uphills eased, and then Blanes blistered past him on the downhills. [Updated October 13, 2022] Upon Kangogoâ€™s disqualification, Kipngeno was awarded second place.																					
EritreanPetro Mamunipped Jornet in the finish chute and the pair finished just a couple hundredths of a second apart.																					
[In 2017, Mamu failed two doping tests, after both the World Mountain Running Championships and the World Long Distance Mountain Running Championships. He was given a nine-month ban starting in September of 2017 by the IAAF for testing positive for fenoterol.]

2022 Hardrock 100 Results: Dauwalter and Jornet Smash Course Records,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-hardrock-100-results-dauwalter-and-jornet-smash-course-records,"The 2022Hardrock 100was one for the record books, literally. While strong from the start, neither field went out blazingly fast, at least in relation to the fastest times run previously in this yearâ€™s clockwise direction. (The course alternates directions every other running.)																					
However, a day later, bothKilian Jornetof Spain andCourtney Dauwalterwould shatter not only the slower clockwise course records, but the overall course records, previously set in the opposite direction with Dauwalter running 26:44:36 and Jornet recording 21:36:24. The two runners ran their respective records in very different fashions, with Courtney dominating the womenâ€™s field from â€œgoâ€ and Kilian having to race Franceâ€™sFranÃ§ois Dâ€™HaeneandDakota Jonesbefore finally pulling away for good on the last climb of the day.																					
Before diving into the exciting stories from the front of both races, what was the arena where this would take place? The 2022Hardrock 100kicked off at 6 a.m. on Friday, July 15. The notoriously challenging loop around the San Juan Mountains starts in Silverton, Colorado, and runs clockwise through Telluride and Ouray before heading east in the direction of Lake City and then returning to Silverton. This year, a few key changes to the course brought the total distance up to 102.5 miles, packing 33,000 feet of elevation gain and loss, all at high altitude and over rough terrain.																					
Pre-race discussion largely focused on the meeting of Jornet and Dâ€™Haene, respectively, the clockwise and the counter-clockwise course record holders, on the menâ€™s side, andUTMBcourse record-holderCourtney Dauwalterâ€™ssecond attempt at the Hardrock 100. These expectations didnâ€™t disappoint, with Jornet and Dâ€™Haene running neck and neck for 95 miles for the win and a new overall menâ€™s course record, and Dauwalter finishing more than seven hours ahead of her nearest rival, also setting an overall course record for women. On to the full story!																					
The menâ€™s race at the 2022 Hardrock 100 finished pretty much in line with expectations â€” with an epic showdown between two of the greatest talents ever seen in the sport â€“Kilian Jornet(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews)Â andFranÃ§ois Dâ€™Haene(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews). But there was plenty more action along the way, with bold moves fromDakota Jones(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews), and some strong running further back the field. Hereâ€™s how this yearâ€™s clockwise action played out.																					
From the start, the runners made a fairly predictable formation at the front of the field. Dakota Jones, Francois Dâ€™Haene, and Kilian Jornet led the charge, running together, with Jones joking with one of our reporters that they had agreed to finish in the aforementioned order. A very happy-lookingDani Jung(pre-race interview) followed close back from the leaders in fourth at the KT aid station at mile 11.5, withJohn Kellythree minutes later in fifth. There was a gap of 10 minutes or more from this front pack toJeff BrowningandLuke Nelson, who looked to be taking it very easy in sixth and seventh.

The front trio remained within a few strides of each other the whole way into Ouray at mile 44, and although looking relaxed, they were already 12 minutes up on course record pace. Jung still followed in fourth, but the gap had widened to almost half an hour. He still looked very fresh and appeared to be taking the high road and running his own race, rather than getting caught up in anything outside of his comfort zone. The next three positions â€” Kelly, Browning, and Nelson â€” also remained unchanged with Kelly appearing more somber than the others, but still making a fast turnaround in the aid station.																					
Jones was the one to make the move that cracked the front trio, and he came into the Engineer aid station at roughly the halfway point 11 minutes clear of Jornet and Dâ€™Haene, who remained together. Jung held on steadfastly in fourth, and former Hardrock champion Browning had moved up to take fifth from a struggling John Kelly.																					
Dakota Jones leading at Animas Forks (mile 58).																					
Jones continued to lead the way through Grizzly Gulch, two-thirds of the way into the race, but the Euro duo of Jornet and Dâ€™Haene had begun to close. By Sherman at mile 73, the two had joined forces, entering and leaving the aid station together eight minutes ahead of Jones.																					
They continued to run within seconds of each other, but by Cunningham Gulch at mile 93, there was a notable shift in tone as the race had begun in earnest. Jornet was the first to leave the aid station with Dâ€™Haene following seconds later. Dâ€™Haene looked strong and can never be underestimated in the finish, but after the headtorches began to flicker on the final descent through Arrastra Gulch, it was Jornet who emerged first from the darkness, having put five minutes on his friend and opponent in the roughly four-mile stretch.																					
Jornet powered through to the finish, taking his fifth victory in five Hardrock starts, and a clockwise and overall course record in a time of 21:36:34. Dâ€™Haene followed and touched the rock at 21:51:21, which was also under the original clockwise record from Jornetâ€™s 2014 run.

Further back, despite losing hold of first place, Dakota Jones never stopped pushing and took third in a strong 23:06:19, making his pre-race goal of breaking 24 hours.																					
[Bonus:Video of the top three men â€“ Jornet, Dâ€™Haene, and Jones â€“ chatting after the race.]																					
An emotional Dani Jung came home in fourth, a position he held essentially all race, in a time of 25:53:47. This is just the beginning of Jungâ€™s season, with UTMB andDiagonale des Fousstill to come, and it will be interesting to watch him build on this performance.																					
Jeff Browning was next home, finishing his sixth Hardrock in a time of 26:17:47, saying at the finish, â€œIt doesnâ€™t get any easier.â€

The 2022 Hardrock 100 start list included 27 women, the most the race has ever had. As anticipated,Courtney Dauwalter(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews) scored a decisive victory, setting a new clockwise and overall womenâ€™s course record.Diana Finkelpreviously held the clockwise record of 28:32 (2010) and the overall record of 27:18:24 (2009). Further back in the field, the top 10 of the field was much more closely packed this year than weâ€™ve seen previously at Hardrock, including last yearâ€™s second- and third-place finishersDarcy Piceu(pre-race interview) andMeghan Hicks, late entrant off the waitlistHannah Green(post-race interview), and 450k Tor des Glaciers winnerStephanie Case(preâ€“ andpost-race interviews). Hereâ€™s how the race unfolded.																					
Dauwalter was off to an early lead, but started conservatively enough without trying to gap the course record pace immediately. She got through the Chapman aid station at mile 18 with 4:16 on the clock. Darcy Piceu andMaggie Guterl(pre-race interview) followed in second and third, some 37 minutes back, in jovial humor, waiting for each other at the aid station. They were followed 10 minutes later by Hannah Green in fourth, with Stephanie Case another two minutes back in fifth.																					
Darcy Piceu getting her walk on at mile 11.																					
Through Telluride at mile 28, Dauwalter had extended her lead on second place, Guterl, to 67 minutes, with Piceu coming in a close third and leaving the aid station alongside Guterl. Hannah Green followed in fourth, with Stephanie Case in fifth, who was already recovering from some early stomach issues.																					
Past mile 33 at Krogerâ€™s Canteen, as Dauwalter barreled ahead, the chasing women had paired off and were working together â€” with Piceu and Guterl still in second and third and all smiles, while Green and Case had joined forces 22 minutes back from that duo.																					
Dauwalter arrived at the Engineer aid station, just past the halfway point, in sixth-place overall with 12:10 on the clock, still looking strong and in control. The effort was starting to show by Sherman at mile 73, but she was still eating well and focused.																					
Hannah Green in her element at mile 11.																					
Stephanie Case, who had crept up the womenâ€™s field, arrived into Sherman as second woman. Hannah Green followed in third at mile 73 â€” looking tired, but calm and collected as she had done all race â€” with Darcy Piceu and Meghan Hicks nipping at her heels in fourth and fifth.																					
By this point, Dauwalter was more than five hours clear of her nearest womenâ€™s competitor, and thoughts were starting to turn to Diana Finkelâ€™s longstanding course records. After a relatively conservative beginning, Dauwalter finally took the lid off of course record pace by mile 93 at Cunningham Gulch, coming in with 24:16 on the clock. She seemed to grow in strength and resolve as the finish line approached, and eventually stormed home in a time of 26:44:38, to add Hardrock 100 to her litany of wins, course records, and other ultrarunning achievements.

Case ran strong to the ending, finishing her first Hardrock 100 in second place in 33:52:46. The town of Silverton came out to celebrate local resident Hannah Greenâ€™s third-place finish in a time of 34:26:39, taking nearly two full hours off her time from 2017.																					
[Bonus:Videos of each of the top three women â€“ Dauwalter, Case, and Green â€“ finishing the 2022 Hardrock.]																					
For the first time in her nine starts, Darcy Piceu finished lower than second, but she worked through endless challenges to finish fourth in 35:08:06. And Meghan Hicks was the fifth woman home in 36:32:52.

2022 Marathon du Mont-Blanc Results: Gold for Jon Albon, Sara Alonso,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-marathon-du-mont-blanc-results,"This weekend, the 2022Marathon du Mont-Blancreturned to lush Chamonix, France, just before 8 a.m. local time on Sunday, June 26.																					
As part of theGolden Trail World Series, the marathon is known to draw some of the worldâ€™s highest-performing trail runners each year. And this yearâ€™s lineup was no exception.																					
For 2022, race organizers repatterned the course and opted for an all-new finish line at Place du Triangle de lâ€™Amitie â€” in the heart of Chamonix. The route charts competitors over 42 kilometers (26.2 miles) of immensely varied terrain, from gentle municipal roads to rocky switchbacks. Cumulatively, it climbs some 2,540 meters (8,333 feet). Itâ€™s one short race thatâ€™s just as stunning as it is grueling.

U.K. favorite â€” and 2019 Trail World champ â€”Jonathan Albonbroke the tape with 3:35:20 on the clock. That time put Albon ahead of the rest of the menâ€™s field by more than four minutes.																					
Italyâ€™sDavide Magniniwas second to the podium with an official time of 3:39:41.																					
A minute later,Ruy Uedaof Japan clinched the final podium spot, at 3:40:42.																					
Moroccan-Swiss athleteElhousine Elazzaoui(3:43:19) and Franceâ€™sThibaut Baronian(3:47:27) rounded out the top five in the menâ€™s race.

2022 Western States 100 Results,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-western-states-100-results,"Thanks to HOKA for sponsoring iRunFarâ€™s coverage of the 2022 Western States 100.																					
After the COVID-19-pandemic-year cancellation of 2020, followed by a year of travel restrictions, which reduced the numbers of overseas runners, the 2022Western States 100was back to being a truly international celebration of ultrarunning. Roughly 380 runners from 32 countries began their journey from Olympic Valley to Auburn, California, at 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 25, 2022.																					
After unusually chilly and wet weather in the days beforehand, normal service resumed on race day with another scorcher of a day for this yearâ€™s race. The heat wasnâ€™t enough to slow downAdam Peterman(post-race interview), who decisively won his first 100 miler in a superb 15:13:48, orRuth Croft(post-race interview), who returned following a second-place finish last year to take the win in 17:21:30, shaving 12 minutes off her previous time. In doing so, she ran the third-best time in the raceâ€™s 49-year history.																					
A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of the Western States 100 possible!

Last yearâ€™s winnerBeth Pascallwas absent from the start list for 2022, but there was still plenty of talent toeing the line. Six of last yearâ€™s top 10 made the final starting list, including hot favorite and previous second-place finisher, New Zealandâ€™sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and last yearâ€™s seventh-place womanEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview), a Zimbabwean living in the U.S., who was believed to be capable of ruffling some feathers on her second attempt.																					
Outside of the returning top runners, this yearâ€™s start list also featured 100-mile world record holderCamille Herron(post-race interview), former podium finisherLucy Bartholomewof Australia, and second-place woman at last yearâ€™s UTMB, Franceâ€™sCamille Bruyas(pre-race interview).																					
Herron was first to the top of the Escarpment, the raceâ€™s high point at mile 3.5, withEllie Pellhot on her heels. They were followed byKeely Henninger, Polandâ€™sDominika Stelmach,Katie Asmuth(pre-race interview), Canadaâ€™sMarianne Hogan(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Lindsey Hagen, and Bruyas, all within a couple of seconds of each other. Hawgood followed along in ninth position, followed by Switzerlandâ€™sLuzia Buehler(pre-race interview) in 10th.																					
The race had yet to space out at Lyon Ridge at mile 10, with Stelmach, Herron, and Hogan coming in together, closely followed by Henninger, Hawgood, Asmuth, and Pell.																					
By Red Star Ridge at mile 15, Croft had begun to make her presence felt and climbed up the field to fourth position. Hogan led the field into Duncan Canyon, mile 24, just 20 seconds clear of Stelmach in second, and then Hawgood, Henninger, and Croft.																					
By Robinson Flat, mile 30, Hawgood and Croft had moved up to share the lead, and they continued to run together through mile 38, which they passed just under course record pace. At the finish line, Hawgood remarked that she and Croft ran together for so long that they felt like it was a weekend-long run and not a race, a great experience for her. Stelmach followed about 90 seconds back in third, a minute clear of Henninger in fourth. Herron had moved back to seventh position but still looked good.

The two leaders were still together at Devilâ€™s Thumb, mile 47, but shortly after Croft managed to break away and ran through Deadwood Cemetery, mile 49.5, seven minutes back of course record pace. Hawgood came through just 30 seconds later, still looking happy and fresh and Henninger looked strong in third, 1:15 back from Croft.																					
The top two remained the same through mile 62, Foresthill, but Herron had begun to fight back and moved up to third position, about 18 minutes back from the leader and four minutes clear of Canadaâ€™sAilsa MacDonald(post-race interview) who had moved into fourth after running the first half of the race right outside the top five looking steady.

By Cal 2 at mile 70, Croft maintained an 11-minute lead on Hawgood, who was continuing to apply pressure, and MacDonald had edged past Herron into third.																					
By the Rucky Chucky river crossing, mile 78, Croft had further extended her lead, but the real action was taking place behind her, with MacDonald making moves and climbing up to second place, 24 minutes back from Croft and three clear of Hawgood.																					
As she crossed the river, she was legitimately smiling from ear to ear, remarking, â€œIâ€™m having the best day of my life!â€ Then with 10 miles to go at Quarry Road, Hogan, who had never been too far out of the frame, made a push and climbed up to third position.

Croft sealed the deal with a 17:21:30 finish to take the win, the third-fastest womenâ€™s time on record. MacDonald finished impressively close, just 25 minutes back in 17:46:46. Hogan took the final podium spot in 18:08:32, less than three minutes clear of Buehler in fourth, in a race that really wasnâ€™t over â€™til it was over.																					
Hawgood, who ran a brave race, finished fifth in 18:16:02, almost an hour better than her previous time. We expect there will be more to come from her if she takes her place on the 2023 start line. In what is certainly a first for the event, the top five women were all from abroad â€” what an international event at the front of the womenâ€™s field this year!

Leah Yinglingwas sixth in 18:32:31 after running outside the top 10 until the raceâ€™s final third, andTaylor Nowlin, who had a strong second half, took seventh in 18:46:42, in her debut 100-mile race. Herron, whoâ€™s had bad luck in this race before, had a strong eighth-place finish in 18:51:54, and Asmuth and Bruyas rounded out the top 10 in 19:30:26 and 19:34:24 respectively. Ultimately, 11 women broke 20 hours this year, with CanadianAnne-Marie Madden(pre-race interview)Â finishing just outside the top 10 in 19:38:44.																					
Womenâ€™s DNFs included Bartholomew and Henninger, both due to injury.

This yearâ€™s menâ€™s race had the notable absence of course record holderJim Walmsley, who has dominated the race in recent years, leaving it wide open for a good number of runners with the potential to win. Among them were seven of last yearâ€™s top 10, including second-place finisherTyler Green(pre-race interview) andTim Tollefson(pre-race interview), who was fifth last year but hotly fancied to be capable of winning this race on a good day. Last yearâ€™s eighth-place man,Hayden Hawks(post-race interview), who ran Western States as his debut 100 miler, was also believed to have more to offer in this race.																					
Notably, joining them as a Golden Ticket entrant wasJared Hazen(pre-race interview), the second-fastest Western States finisher of all time.																					
And last, but certainly not least, the relative new kid on the block, who has quickly shot up through the distances and dominated every ultra heâ€™s ever started â€”Adam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Peterman won his way into Western States with a Golden Ticket at theCanyons by UTMB 100k, where he toppled the course record in his first-ever 100-kilometer race. He took a gamble by taking on his first 100 miler a little over two months later, and defended the decision to iRunFar in his pre-race interview saying: â€œI donâ€™t feel like I always need to just make logical steps because weâ€™re running 100 miles, thatâ€™s an illogical game.â€

The first 3.5 miles of Western States feature 2,550 feet of climbing, to the first landmark at the Escarpment. First to the top wasAdam Kimble, closely followed by Franceâ€™sLudovic Pommeretâ€” with Hawks, Franceâ€™sSeb Spehler(pre-race interview), and Hazen coming through in quick succession.																					
Tollefson,Tom Owens(U.K.), Peterman,Jonathan Rea, andAlex Nicholscompleted the front 10, all within a couple of minutes of each other.																					
By Lyon Ridge at mile 10, Ludovic had taken the lead and he came through Red Star Ridge at mile 15, four minutes clear of Spehler in second, with Kimble in third, and Hawks and Tollefson a few minutes back, followed by Hazen, Peterman, andArlen Glick(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). Nine minutes separated the first eight runners to this point.																					
The two Frenchmen held the top positions into mile 24, just before Duncan Canyon, with Pommeret coming through six minutes off course record pace. At this point, Tollefson had moved up to third, and Hawks and Peterman sat comfortably in fourth and fifth, 8:10 back from the lead, with Glick following 10 seconds behind.																					
Pommeret held the lead into Robinson Flat, mile 30, with the pressure starting to show. Hawks had moved up to second by now and was looking a lot more comfortable, just two minutes back from the leader.																					
Peterman had then moved up the field also to third position, just in front of Spehler, whoâ€™d dropped back to fourth, with Tollefson seconds behind. This chasing pack was just four-and-a-half minutes off the leader.

By Millerâ€™s Defeat at mile 34, Hawks had closed the gap to a minute, and by Dusty Corners, mile 38, heâ€™d taken the lead from Pommeret.																					
Through Deadwood Cemetery, mile 49.5, Hawks maintained the lead and looked like he was having a super day. There had been some reshuffling in the other top positions, with Peterman, Hazen, and Glick all still in the mix.																					
By Foresthill, mile 62, Hawks was still in the lead but Peterman had separated himself from the other chasers in second. He arrived just three minutes back from Hawks and almost eight minutes clear of Hazen in third. Spehler, who had a promising first half, had dropped back the field suffering stomach issues, and Tollefson had also fallen back from the front runners.																					
Hawks was still in the lead after Foresthill, but by Cal 2, mile 70, Peterman had joined him at the front and the race was on! Hazen held third place, 14 minutes back from the leaders, with Glick in fourth another 15 minutes back from Hazen.

When the race reached the Rucky Chucky river crossing at mile 78, Hawks still looked comfortable but Peterman had stretched four minutes ahead, putting 30 seconds per mile on his opponent since Cal 2, showing unbelievable strength and poise for a 100-mile debut.																					
Hazen maintained third position, now 24 minutes off the lead, with Glick and Franceâ€™sVincent Vietmaking up the front five. Notably, Viet was running a strong race, running around the fifth to seventh positions all day.																					
Hazen had started to struggle and soon took a chair at the mile 85 aid station, with Glick moving up to third. Peterman had by now extended his lead to 10 minutes.																					
The top three positions remained unchanged for the remainder of the race, but Peterman utterly dominated in the closing miles, finishing in 15:13:48, almost 34 minutes clear of Hawks in 15:47:27. Glick rounded out the top three in 15:56:17.																					
Adam Peterman wins the 2022 Western States 100 in his first effort at the 100-mile distance. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell																					
Itâ€™s clear from this 100-mile debut that we will be seeing a lot more of Peterman. He executed this win in a similarly patient manner to his win at the Canyons 100k, and he races like a runner with a lot more ultrarunning experience than he has.																					
Moving up all race again, Green ended the day in fourth position in 15:57:10, what was two places back but some 13 minutes faster than his debut at this race last year.Drew Holmen(pre-race interview) finished fifth after a strong, all-day performance. His 16:09 finish this year is also two places back but 14 minutes faster than last year. These two gentlemen have much in common, including their remarks at the finish that they were incredibly happy at the finish having gotten the best out of themselves on the day.																					
Frenchman Pommeret stayed strong to finish in sixth place and as the first menâ€™s masters finisher, and he was closely chased by fellow Frenchman Viet. Nichols moved up two spots this year to take eighth.Cody Lind(post-race interview) moved back from fourth last year to ninth this year. AndScott Traermeted out his race effort perfectly to run his way into the menâ€™s top 10 late in the day for a 10th place.																					
Menâ€™s DNFs included Spehler and Hazen, both due to various physical issues.

2022 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon Results: Nienke Brinkman and Kilian Jornet Break Records,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-zegama-aizkorri-marathon-results,"The last time iRunFar covered Spainâ€™s legendaryZegama-Aizkorri Marathon, the runners in the field made it count. In 2017,Stian Angermund-VikandMaite Maioraset the previous menâ€™s and womenâ€™s course records, respectively, at 3:45:08 and 4:34:27.																					
This year, the first race of the Golden Trail World Series (GTWS) promised no less excitement when the gun sounded at 9 a.m. Central European Time on May 29, 2022. And it delivered â€” the thinnest of margins separated the menâ€™s leaders for the bulk of the race, and the dominant womenâ€™s leader set a record pace.																					
After two years of cancellations due to COVID-19, runners took off on the marathon-length course covering 8,876 feet of vertical climb. To say thefield was stackedwas like saying the sky is blue.Kilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway),Maude Mathys(Switzerland),Nienke Brinkman(The Netherlands, lives in Switzerland),Oriol Cardona(Spain),Manuel Merillas(Spain), andCourtney Dauwalter(USA) packed the grid, among others.																					
Itâ€™s hard to imagine a more formulaic race, and the use of that adjective is not a knock. Like the Alpe dâ€™Huez climb in the Tour de France, the course surges out into the thick of a 15,000-spectator throng crammed along its hyper-technical route.																					
Zegama is Zegama, they say. Verily.																					
Crowds of supporters lined the route for the 2022 Zegama-Aizkorri Marathon. All photos: ToÃ±o Miranda																					
You could sayNienke Brinkmanâ€™sfirst Zegama was a good one. You could also say it was a historic one.																					
Brinkman ledMaude Mathysby three minutes around the halfway point. That condition prevailed and the young Dutchwoman ultimately defied expectations to beat Mathys by over nine minutes and turn in a 4:16:43 to smash the existing course record by more than 18 minutes.																					
Brinkman never trailed in the race past the five-mile mark and ran almost the whole race alone, during a seasonreplete with headline performances. In her post-race interview, she said she came into the race underprepared. Sure. Itâ€™s fair to say that Brinkman, who has notched a 2:22 marathon performance and a Zegama course record within the span of two months, is changing the sport of running as we type this.																					
Sara Alonso(Spain) rounded out the top three, 37 seconds behind Mathys and well inside the previous course record.																					
(In 2015, Mathys received a warning without suspension from the Disciplinary Chamber for Doping Cases of Swiss Olympic for two positive tests for clomifene [previously clomiphene] after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.)

Kilian JornetandDavide Magnini(Italy) ran neck and neck â€” amazingly so â€” for over 14 miles on Sunday. At the first checkpoint at 5.3 miles, Jornet led Magnini by a second. By the next one, 3.1 miles later, Magnini had grabbed a one-second lead.																					
The two ran side-by-side, never hitting a checkpoint more than two seconds apart, until Jornet started to pull away during a steep descent in the raceâ€™s 16th mile. And by the time he cruised down the cobblestones on his way to the finish line, he held a commanding two-minute, 30-second lead.																					
Jornet broke the tape at 3:36:40 and won the race for the 10th time, turning in a new record more than nine minutes faster than the existing one. Magnini followed at 3:39:31, also well inside the old course record and the second-fastest time logged on the route ever â€” a valiant effort by the 24-year-old Italian ski mountaineer.

2022 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: Gold for Joe McConaughy and Annie Hughes,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-cocodona-250-mile-results,"The second annualCocodona 250 Milebegan at 10 a.m. U.S. Mountain Time on Monday, May 2, in Prescott, Arizona. Runners endured scenic but brutal terrain over the 254-mile course and climbed more than 30,000 feet to arrive in the northern city of Flagstaff.																					
This yearâ€™s course was heavily modified from its intended route due to wildfires. The official cutoff time for the race is 122 hours, and it ends on Saturday, May 7.																					
This yearâ€™s event, put on by Aravaipa Running, did not disappoint and saw some impressive times set by those earliest to the finish line.																					
Thru-hiker and ultrarunnerJoe McConaughyand young phenomAnnie Hughesclinched the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s top spots on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, respectively. At the time of publication, runners continue to trickle across the finish line, totally worked but generally beaming.																					
Joe McConaughy, aka Stringbean (his trail name in the thru-hiking community), ran the entirety of the race in absolutely stellar form and broke the tape in a diminutive 59:28:54. That signified a more than six-hour lead over the rest of the field.																					
Michael McKnightpicked up the pace in the back half of the race to close that gap. At 65:39:16, McKnight crossed the threshold at Heritage Square, claiming second place in the menâ€™s race.																					
United States Marine veteranMatt Smithgained steady momentum, moving from the middle of the pack to round out the menâ€™s podium late in the race. He finished in 73:01:19.

Thereâ€™s just something about Leadville, Colorado, legend Annie Hughes. With just 71:10:22 down, the 24-year-old claimed first in the womenâ€™s race. She led the women all race, and did so with nearly no sleep â€” only a few catnaps along the way. This is Hughesâ€™ second 200-plus-mile race in seven months, as she won the 2021Moab 240 Milelast October.																					
Second in the womenâ€™s race belonged toLauren Jones, whose steady pace throughout delivered her to the finish line at 78:34:16.																					
Some five hours later, Aravaipaâ€™s ownSarah Ostaszewskilanded the final podium spot, with an official time of 84:21:24. Notably, Ostaszewski finished fifth in last yearâ€™s Cocodona showdown and looked pleased to have bested her previous performance by two spots.

2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k Results,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-canyons-by-utmb-100k-results,"A weekend for record-shattering continues, with both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s course records falling at the 2022Canyons by UTMB 100k.Adam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished in 8:31:58, taking almost 40 minutes offAnthony Costalesâ€™s2021 record of 9:11:40. Canadaâ€™sJazmine Lowther(post-race interview) dominated the womenâ€™s race from the get-go, and finished in 10:01:54, shaving just one second offBeth Pascallâ€™srecord of 10:01:55, also set at the 2021 event.																					
The 2022 Canyons 100k had double appeal, as one of the 25 worldwide events on the inaugural UTMB World Series, but, more pressingly, as the final Golden Ticket race for theWestern States 100.																					
The race attracted a stacked field, in both the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s races, eager to battle it out for those top three spots.																					
A lot of eyes were onJared Hazen(post-race interview), who is no stranger to these trails, albeit more often seen running them in the other direction. His time of 14:26:46 from the 2019 Western States 100 is still the second-fastest time on record. Having yet to secure a place in this yearâ€™s Western States 100, the stakes were high for him toeing the line at Canyons.Brittany Peterson(pre-race interview) was also hard to ignore, with a strong resume in similar races to this challenging, uphill course.																					
The Canyons by UTMB 100k starts in Auburn, California. It at times runs parallel to and at other times tracks on the Western States Trail in the opposite direction, before deviating onto wilder terrain with steep and rocky descents, and ends with a grueling climb out of an upper drainage of Eldorado Canyon to the finish at China Wall.																					
The gun went off at 5 a.m. on Saturday, April 23, in favorable conditions following a turbulent few days of rain, thunderstorms, and even snow at higher elevations.

Jazmine Lowther(post-race interview) was making moves from the start. The Canadian runner was clearly in fast shape going into the race, coming off a third-place finish at the competitiveChuckanut 50klast month. She covered the first 5.5 miles in 41 minutes and had already extended a two-minute lead at that point on second-placeAroa Sio(post-race interview), winner of the 2019Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 85k, who was followed in quick succession byAnne GeorgeandCarla Molinaro.Jenny Quiltywas through a minute later in fifth position.																					
Positions six to 14 all stuck together for the early part of the race, and the pack included strong contendersBrittany Peterson(pre-race interview),Ladia Albertson-Junkans(pre-race interview), andAnna Mae Flynn(pre-race interview).																					
By mile 14.8, Lowther and Sio maintained the top-two spots, while Albertson-Junkans had broken away from the pack and moved up to third place. Albertson-Junkans had to be a strong contender following her win at Chuckanut 50k last month, and she has proven herself in the past at longer distances too, including a second-place finish at theBandera 100kin 2019.																					
Ladia Albertson-Junkans running happy during the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k.																					
Coming into the Foresthill aid station at mile 32.5, Lowther was still in the lead with 4:47 on the clock. Albertson-Junkans was through 17 minutes later having moved up to second with Sio in hot pursuit. Peterson had also broken away from the chasing pack at this point and moved up to fourth position.																					
The top-three positions remained unchanged when the race reached Deadwood Cemetery 1, 44.3 miles in, with Lowther continuing to dominate and maintaining her 17-minute lead on Albertson-Junkans, and Sio trailing three minutes back in third.																					
Peterson had fallen back to ninth position, and later withdrew from the race. She was replaced in fourth byLeah Yingling(post-race interview) â€” the third-place woman at this yearâ€™s Bandera 100k.																					
Jazmine Lowther won the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k and narrowly set a course record in doing so.																					
While battles were fought for the remaining podium spots, Lowther never faltered in her tour de force. Coming back into Deadwood Cemetery #2 at the final aid station in 7:54:16, now almost 23 minutes clear of the rest of the pack, she appeared to be on course to threaten Beth Pascallâ€™s 2021 course record of 10:01:55.																					
It was nail-bitingly tight, but with an unbelievable one-second margin, Jazmine Lowther broke the tape in 10:01:54 to claim victory in the 2022 Canyonâ€™s by UTMB 100k, a course record, and a coveted Golden Ticket.																					
Following a very patient run, where she climbed steadily up through the field all day, Leah Yingling finished in second in 10:24:51.																					
Aroa Sio, who had a great run and was never out of contention, rounded out the womenâ€™s podium in 10:27:42.																					
Both Yingling and Sio also immediately accepted their Western States 100 Golden Tickets.

The 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k womenâ€™s podium (l-to-r): 2. Leah Yingling, 1. Jazmine Lowther, and 3. Aroa Sio.																					
The menâ€™s race was not run quite so decisively from the start. At 5.5 miles, the elites were tightly packed together, with, it seemed, no one wanting to be the one to make the first move.																					
By 14.8 miles, the top three were still running together, making good tracks with just 1:54:30 on the clock. The trio was made up ofAdam Peterman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),Tim Freriks(pre-race interview),David Sinclair(post-race interview),Jared Hazen(post-race interview), andAnthony Leefollowed in fourth and fifth, still with the lead pack within sight.																					
Peterman undoubtedly had the speed to do well at Canyons, with 2021JFK 50 Mileand 2022 Chuckanut 50k wins under his belt, but it remained to be seen how the step-up in distance would suit him. Tim Freriks has plenty of experience going back as far as the 2016Lake Sonoma 50 Mile, where he finished second.																					
Adam Peterman wins the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k in course-record time.																					
At Cal 2 (mile 24.5) it was still anybodyâ€™s race. At 3:14 into the race, the lead pack of David Sinclair, Adam Peterman,Daniel Jones,Dave Stevens, Jared Hazen, and Anthony Lee all entered the aid station together. Tim Freriks had fallen back a little and followed in seventh place, four minutes off the leading pack. He would unfortunately later drop from the race.																					
By Foresthill (mile 32.5) things had finally started to space out a little and the lead pack was reduced to two, Peterman and Sinclair, who ran through looking fresh, 4:17 into the race. Hazen took up position in third, two-and-a-half minutes back from the leaders.																					
By Michigan Bluff, at mile 38.7, Sinclair had taken the lead by a minute and a half. Peterson did not appear to be panicking and looked happy and relaxed, while Hazen maintained his third-place position, with the pressure beginning to show.																					
David Sinclair is stoked on second place at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k.																					
The order was the same coming into Deadwood Cemetery 1, with Peterman now just 30 seconds off Sinclair in front, and Hazen holding his own in third, about 15 minutes ahead of Daniel Jones in fourth.																					
Peterman took the lead out on the loop and came through the final checkpoint, Deadwood Cemetery 2, four minutes ahead of Sinclair.																					
He proved the 100k distance was no trouble at all to him, and he continued to distance himself from the chasers through the tough final section to finish in a remarkable 8:31:58.																					
Sinclair finished second in 8:43:00 and Hazen in third in 8:47:33, with all three coming in under the previous course record of 9:11:40.																					
After finishing third at the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k, Jared Hazen earned a Western States 100 Golden Ticket.

2022 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: Event Records for Jim Walmsley and Courtney Dauwalter,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-madeira-island-ultra-trail-results,"The 2022Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) kicked off at midnight on Saturday, April 23, in Porto Moniz on the northwest coast of the Portuguese island of Madeira. Runners endured steep, technical terrain over the 115-kilometer (72-mile) course and climbed some 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) to arrive in Machico on the southeast coast.																					
The 13th MIUT took off without a hitch, and favorable island weather paved the way for a handful of exceptional performances.																					
This yearâ€™s MIUT belonged to American favoritesJim WalmsleyandCourtney Dauwalter, with both setting event records, although the course has changed a bit through time. At 12:58:27, Walmsley broke the tape in Machico and surpassedFrancois Dâ€™Haeneâ€™s2017 MIUT timeby more than seven minutes. Less than two hours later, Dauwalter claimed a beyond-decisive win in the womenâ€™s race in 14:40:35. Her time broke the previous womenâ€™s event record of 15:00:55 set byCaroline Chaverotin 2016.																					
The two American runners continue to dominate following their highly successful 2021 race seasons. Their sweep in Madeira this weekend is reminiscent of their similarly impressivesweep at the2021Ultra-Trail Cape Town.																					
In a notable coincidence, both menâ€™s and womenâ€™s silver medals went to French runners, while Switzerland took both bronzes.

The MIUT course apparently plays to Dauwalterâ€™s strengths, and the temperate conditions may have had something to do with her strong run on this unrelenting course. She led the womenâ€™s pack through all but the second checkpoint (kilometer 22.4), where she was tied with Franceâ€™sAudrey Tanguy. But by the 32.7-kilometer mark, the Coloradan had moved more than six minutes clear of Tanguy. She cemented her lead, expanding it to nearly 20 minutes by kilometer 48.4.																					
Dauwalter last raced MIUT in 2019, and she claimed a similarly decisive win in that race (2019 MIUT interview), finishing in a time of 15:17:05, 26 minutes clear of second-placeKatie Schide. Her performance in 2022 improved on her 2019 winning time by more than half an hour.																					
Tanguy arrived in Machico with 16:15:17 on the clock, claiming second in the womenâ€™s race. Though she finished nearly 1.5 hours behind Dauwalter, Tanguy ran a strong race, maintaining second place throughout all but the second checkpoint, where she ran with Dauwalter. The French runner held her own, running within five minutes of her own time from her2019 MIUT showing, where she eked out a bronze in a time of 16:10:59.																					
Switzerlandâ€™sKathrin GÃ¶tzclaimed the final podium spot in MIUT, crossing the line at 16:39:11. GÃ¶tz, like the two women ahead of her, ran a similarly steady race. The Swiss competitor took the third position by kilometer 22.4 and never let go.																					
Rounding out the womenâ€™s top five were Franceâ€™sMaryline Nakache(16:56:06) and Swedenâ€™sElisabeth Borgersen(17:30:22).

Walmsley took an immediate lead in his first international race of the year and was thefirst to enter each of the ten checkpointsbetween Porto Moniz and Machico, finishing 26:44 ahead of the runner-up.																					
Thibaut Garrivierwas second to the podium, arriving at 13:24:58. The Frenchman ran a patient race, sitting back in ninth and seventh at the first and second checkpoints, respectively. By the time he arrived at the checkpoint in Casa do Pico Ruivo (kilometer 74.2), Garrivier had climbed up through the field and was in second place. He maintained that position for the remaining 40.8 kilometers (25.4 miles).																					
Switzerlandâ€™sJean-Philippe Tschumiclosed out the menâ€™s podium at 13:38:55, nearly 41 minutes behind Walmsley. Tschumi and Garrivier were hot on each otherâ€™s heels from the start â€” both men shared the ninth position at checkpoint one. The Swiss runner had pulled into second place by the 48.4-kilometer mark, then dropped to third at kilometer 63.2 and kept that rank through to the end.																					
Fourth and fifth place belonged to Frenchman living in CanadaMathieu Blanchard(13:51:43) and Italyâ€™sAndreas Reiterer(14:10:01).

2022 Marathon des Sables Results: Rachid El Morabity Comes Back, Anna Comet Sizzles,https://www.irunfar.com/2022-marathon-des-sables-results,"The Sahara Desertâ€™sMarathon des Sables(MdS) is as scorching as it is revered. After an October comeback last year following a 2.5-year COVID-19-induced hiatus, the race returned to Morocco again this March.																					
Temperatures well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit and plenty of blistering sunshine are hallmarks of the seven-day, 155-mile desert stage race. Finishing it â€” or simply running in it â€” is no joke. Each year, race organizers deploy 120,000 liters of water, a support staff numbering in the hundreds, and a wide array of vehicles, aircraft, and even camels to monitor the action and keep runners safe.																					
Last year, brutal heat and a virulent stomach bugcaused an unusually high 40% dropout rate. In this edition, conditions in the field appear somewhat more stable. However, challenging desert weather still wreaked havoc at times throughout the week of racing.																					
The 2022 Marathon des Sables started with fair weather on Sunday, March 27. But high heat and howling wind beset the raceâ€™s second stage the next day. Though only moderately long, Stage 2 also negotiated plenty of steep terrain.																					
The wild second stage scrambled runners, especially some perennial race favorites. Eight-time MdS winnerRachid El Morabity(Morocco) led the field coming out of Stage 1 but lost 9 minutes during the marathon-length Stage 2. He landed in third place behind his younger brother,Mohamed El Morabity, a first for the pair as Mohamed has finished second in this race four times, and each behind his winning brother. Mohamed maintained his lead â€” by a razor-thin margin of 37 seconds â€” through Stage 4 on Wednesday.																					
On the womenâ€™s side, first-time Marathon des Sables entrantAnna Comet(Spain) was untouchable. Comet ran in a league of her own for the majority of the race, building a lead of up to 53 minutes by the end of Stage 4.Sylvaine Cussot(France) set an equally solid course all week, generally finishing several minutes behind Comet but well in front of the rest of the field, to hold in second place all week.																					
The gun sounded at the 2022 Marathon des Sablesâ€™ fifth and final competitive stage on Friday, April 1. The first finishers broke the tape in the early afternoon, Moroccan local time. The final, noncompetitive Stage 6 takes place on Saturday, April 2.

Rachid El Morabity stormed back to win, outpacing the rest of the field â€” and his younger brother â€” in the raceâ€™s final stage. Mohamed led by around half a minute at all checkpoints on Stage 5, but Rachid overtook him late, and then pulled away.																					
His Marathon des Sables dominance continuesâ€” itâ€™s the ninth time heâ€™s won the race.																					
Mohamed El Morabity played second fiddle yet again. He claimed his fifth runner-up MdS finish all-time.																					
Aziz Yachou(Morocco) was the only other runner to finish under 19 hours cumulatively. A strong Stage 5, where he took second, left him 4 minutes back of Rachid El Morabityâ€™s week-long pace. This is Yachouâ€™s second MdS effort, and he improved on his fourth-place debut in 2021.																					
Merile Robert(France) took fourth and missed the podium for the first time since 2017, andJordan Tropf(United States) took fifth.

Thanks to Anna Comet, the 2022 womenâ€™s Marathon des Sables was never close. She came into Stage 5 leading by almost an hour, and then broke the tape over an hour before second-place finisher Sylvaine Cussot in the cumulative rankings.																					
Aziza El Amrany(Morocco) rounded out the podium, a sharp debut performance for this Moroccan breakout runner.																					
2021 MdS womenâ€™s winnerAziza Raji(Morocco) finished fourth andManuela Vilaseca(Spain) came in fifth.																					
Bethany Rainbow(United Kingdom) finished sixth as the only other woman to run the race in under 30 hours. She ran a valiant final stage to come in under the gun, finishing just 4:30 behind Comet for second place in the stage.

The 126-kilometer (78-mile) â€œClassicâ€ Transgrancanaria course is a dream race for ultrarunners for a few reasons: the sublime island backdrop just off the Moroccan coast makes for inspiring scenery, the weather can lead to an unpredictable race, and the course is demanding with its 7,500 meters (24,000 feet) of gain.																					
This yearâ€™s race kicks off the second annualSpartan Trail World Championshipscircuit, which covers every continent except Antarctica. The gun sounded at the start line at Las Canteras Beach at 11:00 p.m. local time on Friday night and concluded Saturday at Parque Sur in the town of Maspalomas. Early finishers broke the tape around noon local time on Saturday.																					
Harsh weather hounded the runners from the get-go as consistent rain, high wind, and fluctuating temperatures made for tough going. Conditions were so adverse that race officials chose to cut the route in the steep, high-altitude terrain around Roque Nublo.

The nasty weather didnâ€™t bother Dutch runnerRagna Debats, who prevailed in the womenâ€™s race with a time of just over 16 hours. Debats distanced herself from the pack around midway and never looked back, winning comfortably over second-place finisherAbby Hallof the U.S. Debats came in as a favorite after retiring from last yearâ€™s Transgrancanaria.

2021 Desert Solstice Track Invitational Results: American Records Galore,https://www.irunfar.com/2021-desert-solstice-track-invitational-results,"Sustained speed was on full display at the 2021Desert Solstice Track Invitationalon Saturday and Sunday, December 11 and 12. The invite-only meet, taking place on a traditional track, brought together a fascinating combination of quick-footed trail and road specialists in the 24-hour and 100-mile event, and a number of those runners took home new American overall, track, and age group records, includingNick Coury,Camille Herron, andPam Smith.																					
The weather was excellent, with temperatures ranging between 45 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and low humidity, during the late fall event in Phoenix, Arizona. Though the Aravaipa Running race was open to spectators both in-person and onlive stream, just 25 elite runners participated, the event pitting them against the eternal question, â€œHow far can I run in a day?â€																					
Any ultramarathon of this length holds surprises, and the 2021 Desert Solstice was no exception. Records were set, some runners finished at 100 miles or 200 kilometers into the event, and by the time it was all over, just three women and four men participated in the final hours of the 24-hour race.																					
The top performance of the weekend goes toNick Coury, who nabbed a new menâ€™s American 24-hour record. Previously held byMike Mortonat 172.45 miles, Coury ran a masterclass of a race to finish in 173.01 miles.He ran nearly every single lap under 2 minutes and 10 seconds, with a few at 2:20-plus sprinkled in there for refueling and bathroom breaks. Incredibly, his last eight laps were under 2:00, and his last few at or under 1:30 â€“ thatâ€™s six-minutes-per-mile pace! Coury also won the 2020 Desert Solstice 24 Hour by posting 155 miles.
