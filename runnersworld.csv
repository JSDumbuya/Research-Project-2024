What You Need to Know About Running With Diabetes,"We spoke with a certified diabetes educator for tips on how to keep your blood sugar level stable on the run. Proper nutrition is key to a successful run, race, or workout. But for runners with diabetes, fueling (and the timing of your fueling) is even more important. And, often, medication plays a role as well. We spoke withAmanda Kirpitch, MA, RD, certified diabetes educator (CDE), to break down everything runners with diabetes need to know to keep running strong. Keep in mind, every person is different, so it’s important to speak to your healthcare professional before making any dietary or exercise changes. There are two kinds of diabetes diagnoses—type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition in which the body produces little to no insulin, which is the hormone needed to allow sugar to enter the body’s cell from the bloodstream. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body can’t effectively use sugar as fuel, creating too much sugar in the bloodstream. The most common symptoms of diabetes are increased thirst, urination, hunger, exhaustion, and weight loss. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms without cause, you should contact your doctor. →Sign up for Runner’s World+ for unlimited health, fitness, and nutrition tips! Whether you have type 1 or type 2, you should monitor your glucose levels closely during your run, Kirpitch says, because your glucose levels may fall during and after your run. It can fall as quickly as 30 minutes into the activity and anytime thereafter. (Also, exercise can exacerbate an already-falling glucose level, highlighting the importance of monitoring your sugar before activity.) The risk for hypoglycemia remains immediately following activity and up to 24 to 48 hours after. However, the body’s response to activity may differ depending on the medication a person may be taking to manage their diabetes. If a runner is taking a hypoglycemic oral medication or insulin, the risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is higher.  If a runner with type 2 diabetes is not taking insulin or hypoglycemic agents, the run may require less monitoring. When using insulin to manage diabetes, keep in mind that if there is insulin in the body from a previous meal still working to reduce glucose (commonly referred to as insulin on board or active insulin), the risk for hypoglycemia is higher and adjustments should be made, says Kirpitch. “A recent insulin dose can be more powerful if it is quickly absorbed into a working muscle,” Kirpitch says. “Many runners choose to inject insulin into their abdomen, and avoid dosing in legs and arms, which are muscles most engaged during running.” There is also a risk of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), particularly if diabetics may reduce the amount of insulin they receive during a run, or if they don’t think about the impact of anaerobic activity, says Kirpitch. High blood sugar can cause the body to produce ketones (molecules produced by the liver), which can also be quite serious. Checking glucose throughout the day (via CGM or fingersticks) can help to better understand glucose patterns and adjust medications accordingly. Eating a variety of foods helps to better understand glucose response and better dose for the meals/snacks you’ll need to fuel your workouts and your day. “Working with your diabetes team to learn the response to running at different times of day and planning nutrition and medications to optimize performance and glucose management is key,” Kirpitch says. If you’re not wearing a CGM, it is good practice to check glucose at 30-minute intervals during exercise to assess patterns and make adjustments to management routine, Kirpitch says. It is best to catch a dropping glucose level before it goes low, so you can appropriately treat and continue activity. Once glucose is low, activity should stop until glucose returns to normal. Keep in mind CGMs use interstitial fluid to monitor glucose, and there is a delay from blood glucose. Due to rapidly changing glucose during activity, it is good to recognize that glucose may be lower than value displayed on CGM. Typical symptoms of low blood glucose vary from person to person, but they can include feeling: It’s important to keep in mind that with adrenaline and focus that often comes with exercise, especially on race day, classic symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked. This is why it’s critical to spot check glucose frequently throughout activity or utilize a CGM to assess patterns, Kirpitch says. Generally, thefueling for runswill be similar to what would be recommended for those without diabetes. “Ideally the medications and/or insulin would be dosed according to the fuel needed and subsequent glucose response,” says Kirpitch. Experts recommend that your glucose levels pre-workout should be about 126-180 mg/dL. Choose snacks that are quick-digesting carbohydrates and have small amounts of protein and fat closer to the time you run in order to minimize gastrointestinal stress. Have more substantial meals including fat, protein, and higher-fiber carbohydrates 3 to 4 hours pre-run. If you’re running for less than an hour, you don’t need to worry about bringing fuel for that run; pre-run snacks and meals are usually sufficient. However, runners at risk for low blood glucose should carry a form of quick-acting glucose to treat potential low blood glucose or hypoglycemia. Typical treatments are glucose tabs,glucose gels, dried fruit, candy, orsports drinks, suggests Kirpitch. Runners at risk for low blood glucose should also carry a meter or wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to monitor glucose during activity. Runs that last longer than one hour can be aided by fueling with mostly carbohydrates every 30 minutes to one hour. Fueling can begin 30 minutes into the run at 30 to 60 grams per hour for runs lasting one to two hours and 60-90 grams per hour if runs are longer than two hours. “I always recommend runners carrying their own fuel and treatment as opposed to relying on fueling stations to have what they want or need at the right time,” Kirpitch says. There are many factors that go into managing your diabetes on race day. Running is considered an aerobic activity, which often results in a drop in glucose. However, your surge of adrenaline before the race starts (and at any other points in the race) can cause a rise in glucose, Kirptich says. So, you should learn how your body reacts during different exercise intensities and lengths before race day so you know what to expect. “It’s important to consider the different ways your body responds to glucose throughout a run as well as different types of runs,” Kirpitch says. “Practicing with some shorter race events can give you an idea of how your body responds to the stress of a competition prior to your big day.” After the activity, refuel with carbs and some protein.  There is a risk for hypoglycemia immediately following activity and up to 24 hours later.  There is also an increased risk for hypoglycemia overnight particularly following a late afternoon or evening workout.  It’s a good idea to ensure adequate carbohydrates at these pre-run meals and snacks. Activity passively allows glucose into the cells, reducing the body’s need for insulin. This allows for increased insulin sensitivity—which in turn can make glucose levels lower. Often, activity (as part of a healthy lifestyle) can improve glucose regulation, Kirpitch says. However, self-management strategies around exercise and activity are highly individualized.

Top Scientists Dispel Myths About Women in Sports,"Only six percent of sports science studies focus on women, but these top researchers aim to change that number. Here’s what they’ve learned in their work about how to train and reach peak performance. Michelle Barrack, Ph.D., associate professor of nutrition and dietetics at California State University, Long Beach, fell in love with running her sophomore year of high school. While she played other sports like soccer and tennis, there was nothing like lacing up her spikes and racing on thetrack. And she excelled. Butbone stress injuriesand low bone density limited her training and eventually forced Barrack to quit running competitively while in college. Her experience sparked a new passion. She wanted to understand the risk factors associated withbone healthin runners and help others, especially young women, avoid a similar experience with low bone density and injury. Barrack isn’t the only scientist whose personal interest inspired their research.Shefali Christopher, D.P.T., Ph.D., associate professor at Tufts University and a former collegiate athlete, was competing intriathlonswhen she got pregnant with her first child. She wanted to keep training but when she searched for advice on exercising whilepregnant, she came up empty handed. A few years later, she noticed that many of the runners in herphysical therapypractice were sidelined with injuries one to two years postpartum. “There’s no research in this field. I started to think, is there something that we’re missing?” she says. Barrack and Christopher are part of a growing group of women who are studying female athletes and closing the gender data gap in sports science research. Currently, only6 percent of sports science studiesfocus exclusively on women. That means that most training and nutrition guidelines, along withinjury preventionprotocols, are based on studies of men and how male bodies adapt and perform. The good news? The research world is starting to change. For example, Christa Wille, D.P.T., Ph.D., who studies biomechanics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, insists on including women in her data sets even though it makes her work more challenging. The female body’s fluctuating hormones can add more “noise” to the data, a main reason why women are excluded from scientific studies. “Why not include women? Why not let them be a part of this? Why not let them benefit from this research as well? We’ve got to start somewhere,” she says. On anInstagram post, celebrating her successful defense of her Ph.D.,Megan Roche, M.D., Ph.D., research lead for theStanford Female Athlete Science and Translational Research (FASTR) Programand ultrarunning coach wrote, “I hope this research plays a small part in building more complete female athletes, with strong physical and mental health. Female athletes and coaches are the future. And I’m so excited to help the research catch up.” Runner’s Worldtalked to seven women scientists and researchers who are helping to bring better guidance to girls and women in sport. They’re also debunking myths and setting the record straight about the best way women should train. Whileosteoporosisseems like a concern only for older adults, low bone density is a problem among young runners, as Barrack’s experience shows. Approximately20 percent of collegiate runnerssuffer from one or more bone stress injuries per year. What’s more, when Barrack looked at the data on femalehigh school runners, she found that low bone density was prevalent in these athletes too. Among this younger population, Barrack and her colleagues identified threefactors associated with poor bone health. Athletes with fewermenstrual cyclesper year or no cycle had lower bone density. Those who ran more than five or more seasons—a sign they may be training year-round—and those who exhibited higher levels ofdietary restraintalso had lower bone density. The findings surprised Barrack, suggesting that you don’t have to be a high-level athlete, like collegiate or pro runners, to suffer from low bone density. Barrack worries because adolescence is a critical bone-building period when you accrue the majority of your adult bone mass. Once bone density has decreased, it’s challenging to recover. Among high school runners who had poor bone health, researchers foundnearly 90 percentstill had low bone density three years later. Barrack says these trends are showing up in middle school athletes too. “Prevention is just really important to optimize bone health,” she says. “We can’t start young enough.” For young athletes who are girls, expand your horizonsbeyond just runningand play multiple sports, especially high-impact, multi-directional sports. (Parents should encourage this too.) For instance,studieshave found that ball sports improve bone health in young athletes. Strength training can also help. In Barrack’sresearch, she found that more muscle mass was beneficial to bone. Researchers have identified inadequate nutrition as the key factor in the persistent problem of low bone density among runners. “We know it’s likely low energy availability that is contributing and affectinghormonefunction, which will impact bone health,” Barrack says. When athletes are under-fueled, the body prioritizes essential systems and suppresses the menstrual cycle and other hormones that are essential for bone health. But, if athletes improved their nutrition and maintained a positive energy balance, would that reduce the number of bone stressinjuriesamong female runners? Barrack and Roche were both part of aseven-year study involving collegiate runnersat two NCAA Division I universities that set out to answer that question. Athletes received nutrition education combined with individual consultations with a sports dietitian. Sessions focused on helping athletes optimize energy intake and supporting athletes identified ashigh-riskfor bone stress injury, based on menstrual health, previous injury and bone health history, and eating behavior and attitudes. They found a clear link betweennutrition, hormones, and bone health. When athletes ate enough to support their training, they maintained healthy levels of hormones (like estrogen) that are critical for building and maintaining bone. They saw fewer bone stress injuries in female middle- andlong-distance runners, specifically in the pelvis, sacrum, and femoral neck. Bone tissue in these areas is more hormone-sensitive and likely to be more resilient because of the healthy hormone levels. Roche says paying attention to a stress fracture’s location could provide insight into an athlete’s hormonal health. If the injured bone tissue is more hormone-sensitive, it may suggest that the athlete and her healthcare team should take a closer look at hormonal health and nutrition. While the answer to improving bone health seems simple—eat more—it’s not always easy. Barrack says runners may not meet theircalorie requirementsbecause they don’t know how many calories they actually need or they aren’t hungry after exercising, a time when they should refuel. Plus, it’s hard to fit meals andsnacksinto a busy schedule. The key is intentional planning. “What’s my next day look like? How can I make sure that I have food available to me throughout the day?” Barrack says. If you don’t have time for a fullbreakfast, think of grab-and-go options. The goal is to distribute your calories frequently throughout the day and avoid long periods of time without eating. Aim to eat every two to four hours. And Barrack says don’t skip thecarbs. It’s an essential macronutrient for overall health and athletic performance. According to a recentsurvey, only a third of new moms received any guidance on physical activity. For those looking for sport-specific advice like how to resume running, there’s little to no information. Izzy Moore, Ph.D., associate professor in human movement and sports medicine at Cardiff Metropolitan University, wanted to fix that. She, along with her colleagues, set out to understand what factors contribute topostpartumwomen’sreturn to runningand what hinders it. In herresearch, she found that women were hesitant to resume running because they didn’t know “what happened down there.” If they felt heaviness in the vaginal area (a sign of possible pelvic organ prolapse), they didn’t lace up their shoes. The lack of guidelines compounded this uncertainty because it led women to catastrophize every twinge or ache and left them scared to run. Moore says this fear of movement has been identified as a factor related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries but hadn’t previously been linked topostpartum runners. Pain is also a barrier to running and Christopher’sresearchwas one of the first to examine the risk factors that lead to running pain in postpartum women. She found that incontinence, fatigue, lack of sleep (less than an average of 6.8 hours per night), and a previous running injury all increased the odds of experiencing pain. Returning to runningpostpartum will depend on personal experience: How much did you used to run? Did you run during pregnancy? Did you experience any pregnancy orchildbirth complications? Are you experiencing symptoms of incontinence? Both Moore and Christopher recommend consulting with a physical therapist first—ideally one who works with postpartum runners or a pelvic floor specialist. Concreteguidancemay alleviate some of the fear of movement and uncertainty women may experience. If something doesn’t feel right in your pelvic region, consult apelvic floor physical therapist. “A lot of women run and leak urine and think it’s normal, but we confuse common with normal,” Moore says. “Women shouldn’t have to accept that. It can be treated and managed.” Physical therapists can also identify areas of weakness and develop astrength-buildingprogram to support your running. “Your body will be deconditioned after pregnancy,” Moore says. Start with gentle core andhip-strengthening exercises, like pelvic tilts and hip bridges, before progressing to moves likesquatsandlunges. From there, be sensible. “If you used torun a 5Kin 20 minutes, don’t do that straightaway,” Moore says. Stick with a plan that gradually builds your run volume like acouch-to-5K program. While lack ofsleepis inevitable for new parents, Christopher says you can adapt your training based on your level of fatigue. You can also reimagine your goals. “If you want tobreastfeedand wake up to feed at night, maybe your baseline for running is lower than normal. Maybe you’re running for exercise but not competing because your goals are different right now,” she says. There’s no denying that bodies change as we get older and running can feel different. Duringperimenopause, the phase leading up to the final menstrual period, many women notice an increase in body fat along with hot flashes,fatigue, and brain fog, symptoms that can be debilitating. While changes inbody compositioncan play a role in the change in fitness you feel, research suggests that body fat isn’t entirely to blame. In a recentstudy,Sam Moore, a doctoral student at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, found that higher body fat percentage was linked to more symptoms in perimenopausal women. But she’s quick to note that the actual percentage isn’t what’s important. Rather it’s maintaining a steady body fat percentage. “Even women who enter [perimenopause] with a higher percent body fat, if their percent body fat was stable across the menopause transition, it was indicative of lower symptoms,” she says. “Percent body fat is the relationship between fat and muscle. Women are maintaining or increasing fat but more importantly, they’re losing muscle,” saysAbbie Smith-Ryan, professor of exercise physiology at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, who’s working with Moore. Muscle mass and quality declines because of age and decreasing hormones. “That’s the conversation we should be having,” she adds. Studiesfrom Smith-Ryan’s lab show that women who engaged in vigorous exercise had fewer menopause symptoms. They believe it’s becausehigh-intensity exerciseactivates muscle, potentially blunting the loss of muscle and keeping body fat percentage more stable. “It also targets visceral fat, which is likely linked to increased symptoms,” Smith-Ryan says. While researchers continue to tease apart the cause of menopause symptoms, Smith-Ryan says a great step is to focus on building and maintainingmuscle. “Running long distance is good for your mental and cardiovascular health but doinghigher-intensity worklike intervals stimulates muscle, which is what we see changing the most in perimenopausal women,” she says. Target 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week and strength train twice a week. Runners can be creatures of habit. We love moving our bodies on theroads and trails. Why wouldn’t we run all the time? Well, there can be too much of a good thing, especially for women in peri- and post-menopause. “One of the things with runners is our mitochondria are really efficient,” Smith-Ryan says when describing the energy center in our cells. While efficiency sounds like a good thing, it means that if you run regularly, your body burns less calories than when you were a new runner. Plus, Smith-Ryan says perimenopausal women show greater signs ofmetabolic inflexibility, meaning your body has a harder time switching between burning carbohydrates andburning fat, which is key to health. Taken together, this can lead to weight gain and potentially more menopause-related symptoms. You don’t have to give up running. Instead, Smith-Ryan recommends picking something you’re not good at whether it’s swimming,lifting weights, or doingintervals. Being a beginner will challenge your body—andmetabolism—and can help you feel more like you. And while this is true especially for peri- and post-menopausal women, almost everyone will benefit from trying fresh forms of exercise and challenging the body in new ways.

The Best Gifts for Ultrarunners in 2023,"You’ll get some real mileage out of these gifts. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Ultrarunners tend to be unique people. They’re often more dedicated than your typical folk, turning their enthusiasm for running—and running a long, long way—into a lifestyle. To that end, they’re sure to appreciate a gift that somehow lends itself to their unbridled passion forlong-distance gallops. But choosing such a gift can be a challenge, especially if you yourself are not an initiate of the singular realm ofultramarathons. Never fear—we have suggestions. Below, you’ll find the best gifts to help ultrarunnerstrain, compete, andrecover. Your primary consideration when shopping for an ultramarathoner involves which phase of their experience you hope to contribute to: training, competition, or recovery. Here are some ideas for each phase. Ultramarathoners train for running, obviously, but when it comes to races of ultra duration, they’re specifically training for stamina, mental fortitude, and injury avoidance. There are a variety of tools that can support these pursuits, like fitness trackers, training shoes, resistance bands, and much more. There are a lot of specific pieces of equipment that can vastly improve an ultrarunner’s competitive abilities once the race has started, like race-friendly hydration vests or energy gels for mid-race refueling. From items that support comfort and safety to straightforward race essentials, you can help them gear up for race day. While post-activity recovery is important in any sport or fitness pursuit, few endeavors require rest and recuperation quite like an ultramarathon, which can involve running as far as 100 miles. There are many ways you can contribute to your favorite ultrarunner’s convalescence once the race is finished, including cozy recovery shoes, percussive massage guns, and muscle-icing apparatus. As a lifelong runner, I’ve spent decades experimenting with an expansive range of running gear, and I’m an old shoe at recognizing quality from inconsequential. I’ve bolstered this experience with input from the editors atRunner’s Worldand other outlets, and have taken into account reviews from customers, too. The recommendations below span a wide range of budgets, tastes, and ultrarunner needs, and each will in some way contribute to ultramarathon training, performance, or recovery—and in some cases all three. A qualityhydration vestis at the core of any dedicated ultrarunner’s kit. The Ultra Vest 5 from Ultimate Direction does everything a runner could want it to, offering plenty of cargo space within its 10 pockets, conveniently located trekking pole holders, outstanding comfort and durability, and high water capacity with its dual 17-ounce flasks and space for a 68-ounce reservoir. Some buyers do report quality issues with the included flasks, but those are easily replaceable. It’s a great vest in every other way. If you’re looking for replacement flasks to include with the Ultra Vest, or simply just a pair of high-quality running flasks by themselves, you can’t do better than HydraPak. These 17-ounce flasks will fit in most vests, collapsing as they empty. An easy open cap and easy access straw make it effortless to sip while you run, and a speed-fill lid makes stops at the water station as short as possible. A very small number of buyers didn’t like the straw, but they are in the minority. Ultrarunners tend to spend a lot of time under the sun, which means they need to pack protection. This sunscreen stick from Verta is a great option as it’s highly packable and easy to apply while in motion. It has no nasty ingredients and is water resistant for 80 minutes. I’m recommending the clear version in particular, which is SPF 45. There is a stronger SPF 50+ version, but only in the visible cream option, which can start to look very streaky once you get sweaty. If you’re shopping for an ultrarunner who tends to race on trails rather than pavement, Saucony’s updated Peregrine 13s are a great fit. Not only are they extremely lightweight and comfortable—as all ultra running shoes should be—but they offer solid foot protection and traction. Some users say that the large traction knobs take some getting used to, but once that’s accomplished wearers report that they deliver an outstanding degree of stability, and a rock plate built into the sole ensures that sharp rocks don’t jab through and interrupt the race. Read Peregrine ReviewsShop Women’s For long races over pavement, most ultrarunners look for a shoe that offers plenty of cushioning and minimal weight. The Saucony Triumph 21 delivers on both fronts. At just 9.8 ounces, it rates alongside other ultralight shoes, and its pillowy soles will provide outstanding cushioning through dozens of miles of racing. What’s more, the new flat-knit upper and redesigned lacing system translates into impressive comfort. Support is very limited, but beyond that these are fantastic shoes for long road races. Shop Men’s When a person runs for dozens and as many as 100 miles, chafing can and likely will be an issue. This anti-chafe balm from Body Glide will solve the situation by reducing the friction caused by rubbing while running, and it does so without leaving an oily or greasy residue. If you hear your giftee often complaining of chafing between their thighs or on their underarms, this is a great gift that’ll get plenty of use. It’s sweat and water resistant, and is sure to help improve comfort over the course of the race. Garmin makes a lot ofgreat fitness watches, some of which are theoretically more running-oriented than the Venu 3. But I’m suggesting the new and improved Venu 3 because it boasts the brand’s most accurate fitness and sleep tracking yet, along with their latest fitness and sleep coaching programs. This makes it an invaluable tool for training, competition, and recovering afterward, helping the wearer to track data and improve their performance and rest. It’s also a great all-around smartwatch, so you can’t go wrong. When it comes to entering the singular realm of ultrarunning, it’s sometimes hard to know where to begin.The Ultra Marathon Bibleprovides a wealth of great information on various race types, training, mental preparation, in-race advice, post-race recovery, and more. Perhaps just as valuable as all that info is the motivation it imparts, as there are few mental and physical challenges quite so extreme. For the ultrarunner who’s just starting out, this book is a must. Ultrarunners almost always rely on various forms of on-the-go energy to make it through their lengthy races. That’s where Honey Stinger enters the picture. These energy chews are easy to pack, taste great, and provide a burst of carbs and calories to keep runners fueled. My only wish is that they would offer a variety pack spanning a range of their sports snack products. I said I wanted more Honey Stinger items, right? So here we are. Sometimes the energy chews aren’t enough, and runners need something a bit more substantial to keep them fueled. These tiny waffles taste great, are easy to carry in a vest or pocket, and make for solid snacking throughout the race. The variety pack includes five flavors, and I personally am partial to the cinnamon. Every ultramarathoner wants to show and share their accomplishments. With the BibFOLIO Plus, they’ll have amplehooks for hanging medalsand a bib holder for collecting and displaying race numbers. Its minimalist design fits into any living space, and it’s easy to install. Gone For a Run has even thrown in a dozen bib protectors, just for good measure. Ultrarunners go through a lot of socks. Theserunning socksfrom Feetures are my favorites because they feel great, with a tailored design that doesn’t bunch up or shift around to cause blisters. Our staff even recommends them as the best socks for long runs—and we’ve tried a lot of socks. They’re moisture-wicking, which is important as sweat and precipitation can build up over a long race. All in all, these will help make the whole thing more comfortable. When you’re running an ultramarathon, stretching before and after is essential. Manduka’s Pro Mat is widely considered the standard-bearer among yoga mats—and it lasts for decades. Its 6-millimeter thickness delivers cushioned support without making it tough to balance. The surface materials and uniquely textured top layer are as slip-proof as they come. And it has some great color options, which never hurts. Before and after the race, most ultramarathoners appreciate something warm and cozy to wear. The Scuba Hoodie from Lululemon offers outstanding comfort, with its thick, soft, breathable cotton. Our tester particularly liked the oversized hood (more space for long hair or just to burrow into) and thumb holes. Its relaxed fit is designed to be worn comfortably over workout clothes, and it looks fantastic. For men, I like this affordable hoodie from True Classic. All of True Classic’s products are made of soft, comfy material, but what I really like about its various lines—the Active Hoodie included—is that they’re cut for more athletic frames. The hoodie is also quick-drying and moisture-wicking, as well as antimicrobial to prevent odors. It’s a welcome thing to slip into after a rigorous race. Brooks’ Run Visible line not only delivers the best visibility of any running jacket, period, thanks to its eye-catching combo of high-vis colors and patterns plusreflective material, but it’s also simply a great running jacket in general. It’s got decent wind and water resistance and is warm enough for cooler temperatures. But if the wearer heats up while running, the jacket can be converted into a vest that will continue to provide visibility and a bit of cargo storage. Any time of day—but especially during low-light conditions—this is an outstanding piece of running apparel. For earbuds that not only sound fantastic but feel comfortable through hour after hour of running, the Jabra Elite 8 Actives are unrivaled. Their sound quality is surpassed by few earbuds, but where these truly stand out is in terms of more practical ultramarathon considerations such as durability, battery lifespan, and comfort. The Elite 8 Actives adhere to military standards for rugged electronics. They’ll keep pumping out sound for eight hours with noise canceling on or 14 hours with noise canceling off, and can last up to 56 hours with a fully charged case. And they feel great in the ear.

Is the Keto Diet a Smart Choice for Runners?,"Here’s what runners should know about how ketosis may affect their performance. The ketogenic diet has been popular for several years now, as its hailed for limitingcarbohydratesand uppingfatintake, mostly in the name ofweight loss. If you’re looking to change up youreating habitsthis year, you may be wondering if the keto diet is right for you—and can it help your run performance? To get to the bottom of the pros and cons of the keto diet for runners, we talked to dietitians to get the full scoop. Here’s what to know before you swap all the carbs for all the fats. The ketogenic diet (or keto diet) sets very strict guidelines on how to break down your macronutrient (carbohydrate,protein, andfat) intake. Those following keto consume 80 percent of their calories from fat, 15 percent from protein, and 5 percent of calories from carbohydrates—the fuel source your body and brain prefer to tap first as it’s the fastest and most easily accessible. Staples of the keto diet include fish, meat,eggs, dairy,oils, and green veggies. Even healthy, complex carbs such as whole-wheatpasta, rice, potatoes, and fruit are off-limits. Here’s how the keto diet works: When your body no longer has access to fuel from carbohydrates—either because they’ve been cut from your diet or you haven’t eaten in a long time—it goes into a state called ketosis. That means, your body looks for the next best fuel source: fat. And it uses the available fatty acids to produce a compound called ketones, which is why people who are in ketosis and eating more fat will start to burn more fat. The ketogenic diet is not to be confused with a low-carb high-fat diet, which is similar. The difference is the keto diet aims to increase the ketone levels in your blood, causing your body to enter ketosis. While our bodies prefer to feed on carbohydrates, ketonescanactually fuel thebrainand body, saysLizzie Kasparek, R.D., a sports dietitian with theSanford Sports Science Institute. So it’s not like you’re depleting your body in a dangerous way. “Being in ketosis does not imply reduced muscle glycogen levels. Over time, the keto-adapted athlete may improve his or her ability to burnfatfor fuel and still have glycogen available,” saysKenneth Ford, Ph.D., director and CEO of the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition. (As long as the athlete carb loads.) Whether runners, specifically, should put their bodies in a state of ketosis depends on your goals—and the verdict is still out on whether it really helps with performance. Most studies on keto and athletes involve only a small number of participants and most researchers say we need more studies on the topic. For example,one small studyof five endurance athletes, published in theJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,showed that a 10-week keto diet improved the athletes’ body composition and well-being but not their performance. In fact, the athletes initially experienced reducedenergy levelsand an inability to undertake high-intensity bouts of exercise. Anothersmall studyin the journalMedicine & Science in Sports & Exerciselooked at the effects of the keto diet on exercise efficiency in eight trained athletes. After following the diet, the athletes saw a decline in running speed and power—running speed atVO2maxdeclined by 5 percent. Other research, including areviewof seven articles on the subject, says that there’s limited findings on the benefits of keto for endurance athletes and results are mixed when it comes to VO2 max and other performance outcomes. “There isn’t really a lot of good research that shows those people can perform better, and that’s really what runners care about,” Kasparek says. Ford also points out that in the studies looking at ketosis and performance with negative results, the athletes are not often sufficiently fat-adapted (when the body is trained to tap fat stores for energy, which can take several months) or even in ketosis, making it hard to truly gauge whether the diet is effective when it comes toperformance. Also, performance generally involves an athlete exercising at a relatively high intensity, which requires carbohydrates as the main fuel source. Runners who may benefit from fat adaptation are those running long, long distances, likeultramarathons. Once you hit those later miles, your body relies on fat for energy production. For everyone else, carbs are still probably your best bet, especially if you’re running at higher intensities than you would be when running 50 miles. When you’re running at alower intensity, your body is able to burn fat as fuel, Kasparek explains. “But because carbs are the main source of fuel at higher intensities, you may be sacrificing keyworkoutsor your race to follow a certain diet,” she says. So, does the keto diet work and should you try it? The bottom line is: If done right, runners who need to be able to tap into fat stores overlong distancesmay benefit from occasionally eating fewer carbs and relatively more fat around longer, less intense training sessions. A runner does not necessarily need to be in ketosis to follow this type of “carbohydrate periodization.” Runners who dospeed workoutsor who enjoy shorter distances at faster paces or who incorporatehigh-intensity workoutsinto their training are still better off eating a healthy,balanced dietthat includes carbs. For weight-loss goals, Kasparek says, it’s possible to lose weight by tweaking a regular diet, say, by adding more healthy fat or cutting outprocessed foods. (And focusing on a calorie deficit.) But there’s more than one way to lose weight, and onebananaisn’t going to set you back—we promise.

16 Best Gifts for Active Kids,"No matter their sport, these gifts will excite kiddos and keep them moving. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Kids love to move. After all, playgrounds provide an infinite source of exercise in the form of play. And most outdoor games require some form of exercise—often running—like tag, hide and seek, and hopscotch.Regular exercise for kids has a host of health benefits, not unlike those for adults, including stronger muscles and bones, decreased risk of chronic health conditions, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and improved mood, according toKidsHealth.org.The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americansrecommendthat children ages 6 to 17 years old do at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day.To get (or keep!) your kids excited about regular exercise, we’ve rounded up our favorite items. What kid doesn’t love a good competition? The FitBit Ace 2 tracker makes it easy for little ones to hit that 60-minute daily activity recommendation with a customizable goal. In addition to movement reminders, sleep tracking, and kids-only view on the app, FitBit Ace 2 has active incentives like virtual badges, to stay moving and compete with friends. No more “but it’s cold and rainy” excuses for staying inside all day, thanks to the Patagonia Baggies Jacket. It’s light enough for running and other outdoor activities, while still fending off rain and wind. Like adults, kids have stuff to carry and the Baggies jacket has hand and chest pockets for the essentials. The perfect hoodie for little runners (and their friends). “Let’s race!” How many times have you heard kids yell that to each other? Whether they’re logging miles at recess or playing in the yard, theserunning shoesdeliver on speed, comfort, and durability. Adults love theFresh Foamline from New Balance, making them the perfect option for active kids. (Unfortunately, adults don’t have the option for lace-less in rainbow colors.) Socks can make or break good, hard play. Ditch the worries for blisters or sweaty feet with Bombas youth socks. The calf and ankle variety pack means different sock lengths for comfort and activity. Most runners know the story ofBobbi Gibb, the first woman to complete the Boston Marathon (as an unregistered runner), disproving the notion that girls and women can’t run long distances. Kids of all ages will love this book with gorgeous illustrations and a catchy mantra. It’s probably no surprise that there was a time when women were scared away from riding a bike just as they were from running long distances. Girls and women who rode bikes were at risk for “bicycle face,” a made-up condition said to be caused by overexertion, the upright position, and the effort to maintain balance. This children’s book tells the story of a girl who sets out to disprove “bicycle face” and show girls everywhere that they can do anything the boys can do. Active kids need nourishing, tasty fuel. Nature’s Bakery Fig Bars are made with whole grains and real fruit for a snack that will keep little ones moving. One serving is a two-pack bar. But like all things sweet—these have 14 grams of addedsugar—enjoy in moderation and balance with other healthy snacks like fruits and veggies.

For additional protection, Boco Gear masks also have an interior pocket for filters. For toddlers who are starting out on the bike, fellow test editors with kids highly recommend Woom (forhelmets, too). Unlike other balance bikes, Woom has a handbrake to help kids get comfortable going fastandslowing down. Once your kiddo gets moving, have him or her ride alongside you while you log miles on foot.

Pack a healthy lunch whether it’s for the cafeteria or a backyard picnic with this trendy bento box, made with food-safe ABS plastic andwithoutBPA or phthalates. The silicone lid creates a leakproof seal (but won’t contain liquids like soup). The latch is easy to open for small hands, and the removable tray makes it effortless for grownups to clean. Let your littlest kids take charge of their hydration with a mini CamelBak that holds 50 ounces of water, perfect for bike rides and hikes. Just like the grownup version, the mini pack is comfortable, easy to use, and has plenty of storage for gear and treasures. Good gear means a good workout for kids, too. These no-frills mesh shorts are breathable and come in colors other than pink—refreshing, right? For warmups, workouts, or an old-fashioned game of tag, kids will love these slim-fit training pants that won’t impede movement.

Marathoner Dakotah Lindwurm Connects With the Boy Who Inspired Her at Olympics,"Turns out, 11-year-old Jackson Li is a running super fan. And wow, does he have stories from Paris. Dakotah Lindwurmfinished the Olympic Marathon on August 11 in Paris and in a post-race interview, she mentioned a young American boy, about 10 years old, who was running alongside her at about the 22-mile mark and yelling her name during the race. “He gave me so much inspiration,” said Lindwurm, who wasthe top American, in 12th place, in 2:26:44. “I need to find him. I need to give him a high-five.” Runner’s Worldwrote about it—and the internet did its thing. Later that day, Jackson Li of Larchmont, New York, was identified as the boy. He’s 11, so Lindwurm was pretty close in guessing his age. And he runs distances—cross-country and the 1500 and 3,000 meters for the Tailwind Track Club in Westchester County, New York. Li toldRunner’s Worldhis PR for the 1500 meters is 5:05. So it makes sense that he could keep up with Lindwurm for roughly 400 meters, according to his estimates, even when he was dodging other spectators and cheering for her. Once they were connected, Lindwurm sent him a package of goodies, including one of her bib numbers in Paris, photos, a hat, and some Puma shoes. On her bib she wrote, “Jackson, Bet on yourself.” That turned out to be an appropriate message for a sixth grader with a few nerves before his first year of middle school. The connection with Lindwurm, however, was just the final chapter in an incredible Olympics for Jackson, his younger siblings, Cody and Hazel, and his parents, Courtney Knowlton and Terence Li. Jackson is something of a running super fan. He and his mom, who has a two-year running streak going, never miss an episode of the popular podcastAli on the Run, and recently, they’ve addedNobody Asked Uswith Kara Goucher and Des Linden to the rotation. He watched every episode of Clayton Young’sYouTube seriesdetailing his Paris Olympics build. Jackson even watched the Team Ingebrigtsen television series, subtitled in English.Jakob Ingebrigtsenof Norway was his favorite athlete—until the Olympics. (Now it’s Lindwurm.) About a year ago, Jackson started pointing out to his parents that the Olympics would be happening in Paris and wouldn’t it be fun to go on a family vacation? He kept bringing it up. His parents hemmed and hawed. And then over the winter, Terence Li lost his mother, and the situation made Knowlton decide they were going. “We’ve got to just do the things we want to do,” she said. They were in the stadium for the dramatic men’s 1500 meters and watched AmericanCole Hocker take the gold. Ingebrigtsen was fourth. They also sawGabby Thomaswin the women’s 200 meters. As the track was emptying out, Jackson managed to get close to where Thomas was waiting to do a television interview. He screamed her name, and she signed his hat. The next day, Jackson and his dad, who runs ultramarathons, went out to examine the hilly section of the marathon course a few days before the men’s marathon and to scout viewing locations. Out on the course, they encountered Jess McClain, who took a selfie with them, although she asked them not to post it immediately. Unbeknownst to them,she was on her own course reconnaissance mission, in case she would be needed as the Olympic alternate. (McClain ultimately wasn’t entered, although Fiona O’Keeffe dropped out in the first mile of the Olympic marathon with an injury.) For the men’s marathon, they staked out a cheering position near the 30K mark. Jackson ran alongside Young briefly, cheering for him, and Young later mentioned on theCitius Magpodcastnoticing a young boy cheering for him and running next to the course. At the 30K fluid station, American marathonerLeonard Korirtossed out his hat and picked up a fresh one that was affixed to his fluid bottle. Who picked up the hat Korir threw to the side? Jackson, of course. (He’s holding the hat in the image at the top of this article.) Amy Begley, USA Track & Field’s director of long distance running programs, was working at the fluid station, and she pointed out to Jackson that the hat was autographed inside. Back at the track that night, Jackson managed to get photos withFaith Kipyegon, who won her third gold in the 1500 meters, and Masai Russell, who won the women’s 100-meter hurdles. And he handed his hat back to Gabby Thomas for autographs from the rest of the women’s 4x400-meter relay team. Jackson, his parents noticed, was the perfect age to be seeking autographs. “In four years, it wouldn’t be as endearing,” Li said. The next morning, after a late night at the track, it was a bit of a struggle to rouse the family to go back out to the women’s marathon. Knowlton was insistent, especially because they had had so much fun cheering on the men the previous day: “We’re not skipping the women because we’re tired,” she said. And that led to the moment—or about 90 seconds—alongside Lindwurm. All in all, it was a dream vacation for the family. Knowlton called it “wholesome,” and she said it was fun to root for the American athletes and wave their U.S. flag in Europe, even as the country experiences divisiveness at home. “We’re so grateful for the whole experience,” Knowlton said. “The athletes were so open to the kids. It was an amazing way to spend time with our family.” Sarah Lorge Butler is a writer and editor living in Eugene, Oregon, and her stories about the sport, its trends, and fascinating individuals have appeared inRunner’s Worldsince 2005.

The Best Gifts for Triathletes in 2023,"Give the gift of running, cycling, and swimming excellence. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Triathletes aren’t like other sports aficionados. As the name suggests, they have to be three times the athlete, as a standardtriathlonspans 1.5 kilometers of open-water swimming, 40 kilometers ofcycling, and10 kilometers of running. These races are among the most challenging of physical endurance competitions, so any gear that can help with training, performance, and generally surmounting the ordeal will always be appreciated. Accordingly, you’re searching for something that will help lend your favorite competitor an extra dose of oomph. As a lifelong runner, cyclist, and swimmer, I’m not only highly knowledgeable about these activities, but have used and tested countless pieces of gear spanning virtually every imaginable relevance, and I know which products actually help and which are all hype. To expand upon this, I have scoured reviews from top triathletes and other sport and fitness experts, as well as reviews from real buyers on Amazon. Based on this experience and research, I’ve made recommendations that are specific to each triathlon segment, others that apply to them all, and others still that aid with training and recovery before and after. These are the best gifts for triathletes spanning a range of budgets and competition levels. The Garmin Venu 3 is a great gift for triathletes as it can support all aspects of the sport, assisting with training, collecting performance data, and helping with sleep management. I was already a huge fan of the Venu 2, and the latest generation has taken notable steps forward by improving the fitness and sleep tracking accuracy, adding a bevy of new functions pertaining to training, recovery, and sleep, and improving the design in a number of practical ways. And beyond sports, it’s a great smartwatch in itself, providing plenty of applications and communication tools. There’s even a flashlight! If weather or circumstance prevents cycling outdoors, a cycling trainer allows dedicated riders to use their bike indoors. Frequently these trainers can be so jerky and rattly, however, that the experience is rather tedious, and those who live in apartment buildings end up angering their neighbors with vibration. The Garmin Tacx Neo T2 Smart Trainer eliminates all of that. Its incredibly smooth flywheel feels like real outdoor riding, and reduced vibration means that you won’t bother anyone. Connect to the included app to track performance, and the Tacx training subscription allows you to follow immersive training videos on TV. While it’s definitely one of the pricier indoor trainers, it’s also definitely among the best. A solid transition bag—the hub where a triathlete stores and switches through all their gear—is a must on race day. Zoot’s Ultra Tri Bag proves why thanks to its smart, durable design. With plenty of storage space and dedicated pockets for everything, including a helmet and wetsuit, it does a great job of keeping everything organized while separating the dry from the wet. Comfortable on the back and shoulders and durably crafted, this bag will be a welcome inclusion for years of racing. Energy gels are a tried and true go-to for a bit of extra fuel on the go, providing a dose of vitamins and nutrients to help a triathlete keep up their pace over the course of a race. I’m a fan of Honey Stinger’s wide-ranging sport snacks in general, and that includes its energy gels. With this variety pack you can give the gift of ten gel packs spanning two flavors, which should last through somewhere between 3 and 10 competitions. Whenever you’re discussing the best helmets for road cycle racing, the Giro Aerohead will inevitably enter the conversation. Thanks to its outstanding aerodynamics it helps riders cut through the wind, but the reason I’m singling it out is thanks to the outstanding protection afforded by its MIPS rotational impact liner. Other helmets might be a bit lighter, while others still may have better visor optics (though the Aerohead visor’s magnetic attachment is nice), but I’ve seen enough smashups on race day to know that safety takes priority. There are a ton of adequate massage guns on the market, but I’m recommending the TheraGun Mini because triathletes can toss it in their bag and pack it along for race day. That way you have it on hand if a cramp strikes. The Mini has three speed settings and provides firm, steady repetition. It also comes with three different massage heads so you can choose how wide or targeted you want its strike to be. People love this thing. Pretty much the only criticism you can level at it is that the price certainly isn’t cheap. For truly dedicated triathletes, data is essential to analyzing and improving performance. With Form’s smart goggles, wearers benefit from practical swimming considerations like a comfortable, leakproof fit and anti-fogging, but they also receive an array of data in real-time pertaining to factors like time, distance, stroke rate, pace, and more. They come with a one-year subscription that includes over 1,500 workouts and 30 training plans which are instructed live via the in-goggle display. Is a transition mat going to make or break a triathlete’s performance? Probably not. Will it make the race a bit more comfortable? Sure! This mat from Kona provides a non-slip, dry surface for changing out of a wetsuit, then rolls up small for easy packing. As an added bonus, its bright color options are easy to spot among a sea of towels in the transition area. When it comes to choosing cycling shoes specifically for a triathlon, two considerations surpass all else: easy transitioning—meaning that the shoes will come off fast when it's time to switch to running shoes—and minimalized weight. These shoes from Triseven nail both factors, delivering fast removal and clocking in at a feather-light 285 grams. They’re breathable yet adjust well to provide a firm fit, and work with all the most popular pedal systems. Their unisex fit makes them highly versatile, but that can make it tricky to choose the right size. The Endorphin Speed 3 from Saucony is an outstanding pair of running shoes by pretty much every consideration. They consistently receive high praise for their outstanding cushioning and neutral yet stable support, and I personally think they’re among the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever run in. Designed to add an extra spring to your step, they’re great for both training and race day. Some wearers do report that their pillowy cushioning takes some getting used to, but the vast majority think they’re just as comfortable as I do. You can’t enter the race without a number, and this race number belt from RJ-Sport not only holds a triathlete’s number bib securely in place, but its soft elastic makes it comfortable enough that it won’t hinder performance. As an added bonus, it’s equipped with six loops for holding energy gel or bars. It won’t work with waists under 26 inches, but it adjusts and stretches to fit up to 70 inches. As any experienced triathlete will tell you, when you’re running for long periods with clothing and gear rubbing against your skin, things can get pretty chafed and uncomfortable. This anti-chafe balm from Body Glide helps prevent chafing, and it does so without leaving the wearer coated in greasy oil. It’s resistant to sweat and rain, and there are no nasty chemicals in the ingredients. A quality tri-suit is essential not only for competing, but for staying relatively comfortable throughout the race. Santic’s tri-suit for women is a great option thanks to the fact that both its material and butt pad are fast-drying, which is very handy when you’re going directly from the water to a bike. It also has extra-wide arm holes, which helps to reduce chafing. A long cord attached to the zipper makes it easier to dress, and there’s a pocket on the left leg for energy gels, keys, or phone. Fast-drying, with extra-wide armholes to prevent chafing and an extra-long zipper to make it easier to put on and take off, this tri-suit from Synergy hits on all the key points. As an added bonus, it features silicone leg grippers to keep the legs from riding up, as well as a modesty panel at the crotch to provide a bit of…modesty. While it does have a zipping pocket at the back, it can be difficult to reach, especially on the go. As any fitness enthusiast knows, few things impact your training and performance as much as what you eat. The Endurance Training and Diet Cookbook is packed with great information about how and what to eat specifically for endurance competitions like triathlons. It details the best nutrition and foods to consume while training, then before, during, and after a race, and can generally help any triathlete up their game through proper eating habits. While the recipes it contains are only decent, the nutritional information it offers is invaluable. A solid set of swimming goggles are an essential part of a triathlete’s kit, and Speedo pretty much sets the standard in that realm. With its Vanqisher 2.0 line, the brand has increased peripheral vision by 25 percent while improving its anti-fogging capabilities. Super comfortable and watertight, they feature interchangeable nose pieces so you can find your best fit—though a few reviewers do have issues swapping them out. That aside, these are all-around great goggles. For races that demand swimming in colder water, a wetsuit with full body coverage and greater warmth is key. The Volt wetsuit line from XTERRA goes the next step by providing not only warmth and comfort, but improved performance. It accomplishes this by decreasing drag in the water while improving the wearer’s buoyancy—both of which translate into easier, faster swimming. This is a good wetsuit for competitors of any experience level, though more experienced racers may want to step up to Xterra’s advancedVortexline. Bike boxes tend to get a lot of complaints leveled against them, largely because they’re typically used to check a bike onto a plane, and anything involving airports, flying, and checked luggage is destined to draw ire. Air travel issues aside, the RoundTrip Transition Case from Thule is the best bike box out there. Super protective and relatively straightforward to pack, it’s an unrivaled option for keeping your bike safe while in transit. It also boasts integrated wheels for easier mobility and a built-in repair stand, the latter of which is completely unique. The case is very heavy and pretty bulky to store, but if protection is the priority, it will absolutely deliver. A travel towel is always a great item for a triathlete to pack along, and this microfiber towel from Youphoria is a solid option. It’s available in a range of sizes from hand to full body, dries fast, and is highly portable. Like all microfiber towels it’s only moderately absorbent, but it will more than suffice for a quick post-swim dry-off or to sop up some sweat.

"How to Run With Poles, According to a Pro Mountain Runner","Follow these tips for maintaining your footing on rough or steep terrain. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Watch any Europeantrail raceorultramarathonand odds are you’ll find runners huffing and puffing up insanely steepclimbsor tip-toeing atop razor-thin mountain ridges with poles in their hands. Running and racing with poles is common practice in Europe. Yet, here in the United States, there seems to be a stigma that running with poles is a sign of weakness. “I’ve had people tell me that I’m ‘cheating’ using poles when I pass them because they allow me to push with both my legs and my arms and go faster. It’s not cheating. It’s a choice,” saysHillary Gerardi, 2021Marathon du Mont-Blanc90km winner and professional mountain runner for Black Diamond. Despite being a perfectly acceptable and legal choice, manytrail runnersstill shy away from using poles. But you don’t have to. Here’s how to run with poles, why they’re helpful, and tips for using them to help your performance. “If you can learn to use your poles efficiently, you’re reducing the amount of output and energy you need to use from yourlegs,” explains Gerardi. This is because you can push with yourarmsand legs (versus only your lower body without poles), thus reducing the strain on your legs, “particularly if you’re going to be doing a bit of vertical gain,” adds Gerardi. By dispersing weight between your arms and legs, it saves leg energy that can equate torunning fartherandfasterthan you could without poles. Another benefit to using poles, especially for beginner trail runners, is that poles help youbalance better, particularly through technical and rocky terrain. Instead of having two points of contact (your legs), you now have four to help keep balance. Gerardi explains that having the two extra points of contact can help you more easily retreat to safety if you experience aninjury, like rolling an ankle, so they also provide a security measure. While poles can be a tremendous asset, they can also slow you down on the wrong terrain, so it’s important to know what type of terrain you’ll be running before thinking about bringing poles. Poles are most useful whenclimbingsteep trails, however, determining how steep and long a climb needs to be to use poles largely depends on the individual.Beginnersthat aren’t so focused on time may find poles useful on the shorter climbs, whereas time-focused runners may not want to take the time to break out the poles for short climbs. Another time to use poles isduring descentsbecause they can help you maintain balance through rocky and dangerous footing while lesseningeccentricloading (that’s the weight you carry own a downward movement) of the muscles and joints. Poles can also be a lifesaver for some runners during longultra-distance raceswhen your legs are screaming and you have nothing left in the tank. Except for vertical kilometer races (very short, steep uphill races with no downhill), where you’ll be using your poles the entire time, you’ll most likely alternate between using your poles and not using them, so you’ll need to stow your poles away when not in use, such as on nearly flat trails. Mosthydration veststhese days have some mechanism to carry poles when not in use. Keep in mind, it takes time to take the pole out and stow them away when not in use, so that’s part of the strategy of using them too and something to practice. While there is no definitive rule of thumb for when to use poles, only by practicing can you develop an understanding of when poles are helpful and when they aren’t. Running polescome in two configurations—fixed and adjustable. Gerardi says that if you already know your pole length, it’s probably best to go with fixed poles because they are lighter. Adjustable poles are better if you’re unsure of your length or want to share your poles with someone else. First-time pole users should start with adjustable-length poles. This will allow you to play with different lengths to find your ideal height, which is usually when your elbows bend at a 90-degree angle when holding the handle. You can also buy foldable poles, such as theBlack Diamond Distance Carbon, that can stuff into your hydration vest when you’re not using them, making them easier for travel. Once the poles are adjusted to the correct height, knowing how to use the pole straps properly is vital. Using the straps allows you to get better leverage by bearing weight on your wrist versus solely using your hand grip. To do this, thread your hand up from underneath the strap so it wraps around the bottom of your wrist. There are two main approaches to poling technique: double-poling and alternating poles with your legs. Double-poling:This is when you place both poles simultaneously in front of you and take three steps between them. As you move forward, push through the poles with a slight lean forward and repeat. Double-poling is typically used in very steep terrain. Alternating poles:To do this, plant your pole in sync with your naturalstrideandarm swing. The best way for beginners to learn this method is to start walking with a natural stride and arm swing with the poles hanging down from the straps. Once you settle into a comfortable walkingcadence, grip the handles and begin planting the poles with an opposite arm and opposite leg pattern without altering your natural arm swing. Plant the pole at roughly a 45-degree angle at a distance in line with your opposite foot. As you walk past the planted pole, push through the ground as your foot lifts. Once you feel comfortable using the alternating pole walking, practice it while running. At slow speeds, you’ll plant the poles every step as you did while walking. As the pace quickens, you’ll want to plant the poles every second or third step. Gerardi warns that if you don’t practice before using them before a race or big trail run, “poles won’t help you, they’ll get in the way, you’ll getblisters, and you’ll get frustrated.” So to get better before using them for big events, start with short runs; as you get more comfortable using poles, you can take them on more extensive outings. Running with poles will initially look and feel awkward. That’s expected and okay. As with any skill, it takes time to learn it. And as far as looking awkward while carrying running poles, don’t worry about trying to look pretty. Gerardi says that most of the photos of professional runners with poles are staged photoshoots. “It’s hard to make using poles look rad, but everyone is doing it; everyone uses poles,” Gerardi says. Gerardi shares her best tips for mastering running with poles. Some areas don’t allow carbide tips because it scratches up the rocks and can contribute to erosion. If you place your pole tip on a rock, it can skitter off, and you lose energy. If you place it on soft ground, you’ve got a better chance that it’ll support you and help propel you forward. You need to really familiarize yourself with whatever system you’re using (across the back, belts, quivers, etc.) so that you don’t get frustrated. If you are going uphill with poles, you need to take care not to stab someone behind you. Poles should be held so that the tips point down. When you get back from an outing, clean them off, wipe them down, and try to dry off the water that gets into the moving pieces to avoid things getting rusty or stuck. Sticking a pole between two big rocks and putting all of your weight on it at an angle can cause them to break. If they get stuck, try reversing the action/motion of how you placed the pole rather than pulling it in the direction you want to go. Test out your poles and the folding/opening mechanisms in the days before a big race/event you care about. Sometimes they get sticky and hard to fold. Do some research on your airline about putting your poles in your carry-on versus checked luggage when you’retraveling.

The Best Yoga Poses for Menstrual Cramps,"Because a little bit of movement can go a long way when it comes to relieving period pains. Let’s be honest, sometimes going for along runis the last thing on your mind when you’re experiencing menstrual cramps. In these times, practicing yoga can serve as a smart alternative as it can soothe your body and mind, and even help strengthen your running muscles, so you maintain yourfitness goals. That’s why we tapped two experts to explain how practicing yoga can assist in easing your period cramps. Find some relief with these tips and poses. TheAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologistsestimates that more than half of women who menstruate experience some kind of pain for one or two days each month. For some, that pain can feel mild and for others, it can become severe. During menstruation, “the uterine lining releases a substance called prostaglandins and the prostaglandins cause cramping of uterine muscle,”  explainsBrandon Martin, M.D., a physician in obstetrics and gynecology at St. Luke’s Hospital in Easton, Pennsylvania. Though experiences vary from person to person, this release is what causes pelvic cramping, pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or naproxen, is one way to relieve menstrual cramps. But for runners, mixingnonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAIDs)with intense exercise can be risky, considering astudypublished inMedicine & Science in Sport & Exercisein 2007, which included 55 ultramarathons, suggests use of these pain-relievers before, during, and after training can increase oxidative stress, which may be due to the meds’ affect on kidney and liver function. Newer researcher on ultrarunners also points to the potential for negative effects on thekidneys. Exercise is another way to address menstrual cramps.  Ameta-analysispublished in 2019, which reviewed 12 trials including a total of 854 participants, suggests exercising at least three times a week or more, for 45 to 60 minutes each, can help reduce menstrual pain, regardless of exercise intensity. In terms of yoga specifically, a recentreviewpublished inFrontiers in Pain Researchhighlights several studies that suggest practicing yoga over the course of several weeks or months can improve menstrual pain. This is likely because yoga includes physical postures, breathing exercises, and relaxation methods that help manage pain. The exact mechanism through which yoga and other types of exercise provide relief from menstrual cramps is not fully known though, Martin tellsRunner’s World. But many patients report that they perceive menstrual cramps as less painful and for shorter duration when engaging in yoga and other exercise activities, he adds. “Yoga really gives us permission to listen more, to adjust, to accept, and to find power and strength in different kinds of movement,”Cara Gilman, yoga instructor, run coach, and founder ofRun YogatellsRunner’s World. Not only can yoga support those dealing with period pains, but it also supports a runner’s stride. “Yoga bringsmobilityand motion to other areas of the body which helps keepinjuriesaway that are caused by overuse,” Gilman adds. What’s more: Yoga really helps improve your mind-body connection, which is also pertinent to running. “It’s working that mental fitness which is so important because listening is how we get stronger,” says Gilman. Practice this sequence when you’re in need of an energy boost and a little relief from menstrual cramps, says Gilman.

"Ultrarunner Nedd Brockmann Just Ran 1,000 Miles. In 12 Days. Around a Single Track.","The Australian raised nearly $2 million for charity during his tortuous “Uncomfortable Challenge” in Sydney. “I just never could have imagined it to be this bad. And I’m forever grateful for it all. Wouldn’t change a fkn thing. Post traumatic growth coming right up.” Nedd Brockmann, a 25-year-old electrician-turned-extreme-ultrarunner from New South Wales, Australia, posted these words, among others, to hisInstagram accounton the 10th day of an almost unfathomable running challenge. The challenge in question? To run 1,000 miles in just 10 consecutive days—starting on Thursday, October, 3—around a single 400-meterrunning trackin the Sydney Olympic Park. The reason? To raise vital funds to support Australians experiencing homelessness, while trying to set a new world record. Known asNedd’s Uncomfortable Challenge, the charitable mission certainly tested Brockmann to his limits. In the aforementioned ‘Day 10’Instagram post, with 886 miles of running already “chewed up,” the suffering but steadfast runner was battling swollen toes, feet that had inflated to become three shoe sizes larger than normal, and no sleep. Brockmann’s aim was to set the fastest known time for 1,000 miles and better the current record of 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds achieved by legendary ultrarunner Yiannis Kouros in New York in 1988. The target was extremely ambitious, and by Sunday,  October 13, it was looking unlikely that Brockmann would hit it. However, while the world record was no longer in reach, the 1,000-mile mission was still very much on. With well over $600,000 already raised for charity, Brockmann was determined to hit the distance, come rain, pain, or shine. In fact, due to rain, his swollen feet and red-raw blisters had worsened. Throughout the challenge, he ate and attempted to sleep in a tent at the track and avoided running during the hottest parts of the day wherever possible.  On Tuesday, October 15, Brockmann finally completed his multi-lap quest in 12 days, 13 hours, 16 minutes and 45 seconds, averaging 79 miles of running per day. The broken man broke into tears when he finished, unable to dam up his emotions. Brockmann was treated like a hero by the 1,000-strong crowd that had come to cheer at the track in Sydney—his ovular home for the past 12 days. As it stands, Brockmann has raised more than $1,900,00 for charity through hisUncomfortable Challenge. But this isn’t the first time that Brockmann has taken on a jaw-dropping ultrarunning adventure. In 2022, he ran an extreme 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) in 46 days across Australia, having started in Western Australia and finished at Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach to 10,000 supporters. Here, he raised $1,200,000 forWe Are Mobilise, an outreach program that combats homelessness.

It has mesh panels which allow them to breath easily and stay cool, and a large window that allows them to get the best view. It also extends out fat enough for them to lay down comfortably.

It comes in throw, twin, queen, and king sizes, and has a fleece-lined back. This miniature zen garden is both a nice way to relax, and a humorous addition to a living room or office.

Want to Run an Ultra But You’re Trail-Averse? Try New Shoe Brand Mount to Coast,"Mount to Coast’s new road shoes are designed for racing hundreds of miles over multiple days. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? New running shoe brand Mount to Coast has an unconventional mission: to develop betterultramarathonroad shoes. As a marathoner wary of entering an ultra because the terrain is usually not paved roads, I was intrigued by Mount to Coast’s concept. The brand actually plans on releasing a trail shoe in the future, but its first three models are all for use on pavement. Of those three, the R1 was worn by British ultrarunner Justin Montague when he competed in the little-known MTC Jogle, a 17-day ultramarathon during which Montague broke the previous course record by 40 hours. He ran a total of 854 miles. And he wore only one pair of R1s. The R1 has no carbon-fiber plate. The foam, LightCell, is PEBA-based and nitrogen-infused. To combat the foot-swelling that ultrarunners experience when accruing hundreds of miles in the span of a couple of days, the shoe has a dual lacing system that includes a cinch cord similar to “Quick Lace” designs, which can be easily adjusted to provide more space as the foot swells. Mount to Coast’s shoe development team saw runners’ toes poking through torn uppers; TunedFit is supposed to prevent this from happening. When I put on theshoes, there really wasn’t anything special to them that indicated they’d last for over 850 miles; the R1 is ultralight (a men’s size 9 weighs only 8.5 ounces). Our testers, however, gave the shoe top marks. And as I ran in the R1 through multiple heatwaves, lots of base-building runs, and a couple of long ones with a friend who gushed how much she “loved those shoes,” I could see the allure. It’s a neutral, moderately-cushioned trainer that had me adding in some speedwork on days with 90-plus-degree heat because of the high rebound. In the words of one of our wear-testers, the R1 is “a solid, versatile trainer for all kinds of efforts.” One runner said Mount to Coast especially nailed the amount of space at the front of the shoe. “I love the toebox! It’s roomy! My bunion feels at peace,” she said, adding that the R1 has become her new go-to daily trainer. “The shoe is light. It’s firm. It’s breathable. I just fell in love.” Where the R1 is made for racing hours on end, the S1 is for training or for the everyday grinder; however, itdoeshave ultramarathon cred. At the same MTC Jogle Montague set a course record at, Chinese ultrarunner Lucong Geng ran 600 miles in a pair of S1s. The shoe isn’t outfitted with a TunedFit dual-lacing system like the R1, but it does share a nitrogen-infused PEBA midsole and GoGlow geometry. Its moderate cushioning and built-in support provide a solid platform for racking up daily mileage. Testers initially felt the S1 was “unremarkable.” And honestly, I had those thoughts too during my first run in the shoe. After running in the R1, the S1’s ride felt clunky because it’s heavier. But it wouldn’t be fair to compare a training shoe to its racing counterpart; that would be like pitting the Brooks Hyperion (a speed shoe) up against the Brooks Ghost (a daily trainer). “Overall, I had no issues with the S1, but the ride felt flat with not a lot of forward propulsion,” said tester Gabe Franc, whose pace averages 7:30. “I also didn’t gravitate to it for longer distances since the impact was fairly firm, especially compared to other shoes like the Asics Novablast, which has been my recent favorite go-to pair of shoes for long runs. “I think the S1 is a solid first concept for a line going forward in Mount to Coast’s lineup,” Franc continued. “For its weight and stack height, it is fairly responsive. It feels like a heavy shoe, but the firm outsole gives it a responsive feel. I think the durability and stability are also very good for this shoe. The outsole has shown little wear so far, besides just the white rubber turning black from the asphalt. The stability feels very solid too, even though it isn’t labeled as a stability shoe. I felt like there was extra support keeping everything aligned, which is a strong point for a shoe being ultramarathon-designed.” Like Franc, other testers highlighted the shoe’s overall comfort and rebound, drawing comparisons to other cushioned trainers like theBrooks Glycerin. All of Mount to Coast’s shoes come with a shoe bag, technology card, and poster. One tester was, to put it mildly, wary of what he found inside his Mount to Coast shoe box. But he changed his tune once he went out for a run. “Upon returning home with my shoes, I looked at the box and I’d never heard of Mount to Coast shoes. I was a bit skeptical about these shoes,” said tester Don Kuntzman, who’s tested for RW for almost a decade. “Then I opened the box and the first thing I see is a poster and a free shoe bag. And my skepticism was beginning to turn to outright cynicism. Who backs free stuff in the box? So my thinking is, ‘These shoes are going to be bad!’ But after several runs I am amazed how good these shoes are. Though they’re not for sprinting because it’s hard to get up on your toes. They’re great for training runs and I imagine for ultra distances, which they’re designed for. In the end I’ve run in these shoes everyday since getting them and they are simply fantastic.” The P1, which was released at the end of August, rounds out Mount to Coast’s growing collection with a plush stability trainer that’s comparable to Saucony’s Hurricane and Brooks’s Glycerin GTS. Instead of placing dense foam on the lateral and medial sides of the foot, like the guide rails found in Brooks and Altra, Mount to Coast fused a rail connecting the medial and lateral sides. The flexible structure, called a 3D Archrail, resembles a tapered road you can visibly see on the bottom of the shoe. The idea behind the 3D Archrail is to reduce forefoot abduction (according to Mount to Coast, most stability shoes have tech placed in the rearfoot area to control pronation) and therefore, decrease injury risk. None of our testers were injured while running in the P1, but that’s pretty standard in the case of testing most of the shoes we give to runners for evaluation. But the common thread among P1 testers was the shoe’s comfort. “One of the most noticeable aspects of the P1 is the comfort level right out of the box,” said tester Eric Bartosz, who is a heel striker. “The LightCell foam combined with the pliable mesh upper gives the impression that it could be worn all-day long with no complaints. The foam gives optimal cushioning without feeling like a waterbed (sorry Nike Invincible) and at the same time feels fast and ready to eat up miles for days.” Tester Renee Hislop, who averages 45 miles a week on road, trail, and gravel, took the shoe out for a couple long runs. “I loved everything about these sneakers,” she said. “The cushioning was like a mattress topper foam. You put your foot in the shoe and the cushioning formed around your foot and you never worried about slipping around or blisters. I distinctly remember being at mile 15 of my run and walking into Wawa for a Gatorade feeling like I was walking on clouds. The comfort of these sneakers was superior. I had my Gatorade and kept on running.” Buy MTC R1Buy MTC S1Buy MTC P1 Amanda is a test editor at Runner’s World who has run the Boston Marathon every year since 2013; she's a former professional baker with a master’s in gastronomy and she carb-loads on snickerdoodles.

The 7 Best Cookbooks for Runners Who Love Good Food,"Add some zest to your carbo-loads with these simple, healthy recipes. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? One of the most satisfying upsides of running—once you’re past all the self-induced struggle that comes with it—is the feeling of voracious hunger after a hard workout. It’s a natural response to putting stress on your body: Your tired muscles want to repair themselves, and they need the building blocks to do so quickly. Suddenly, anything from a spoonful of peanut butter to cold pizza looks like a gourmet meal. I’ve been there, too, and there’s nothing wrong with housing a slice after a good run—but ultimately, some foods will help yourecover faster, burn fuel more efficiently, andfeel betteron your runs. That meansplanning your nutritionis paramount if you’re looking to get the most out of your training. And if you want to keep things interesting (no shade to the chicken, rice, and frozen broccoli that propelled me through college), a cookbook written specifically for runners may be a critical kitchen companion. Whether you’re curious about yourmacronutrientintake, struggling to understand how much to eat, or just looking to add some spice to your training-day dinners, these cookbooks for runners add some extra zing to your fuel. Each recipe strikes a stellar balance between healthfulness and indulgence, and some help you work around dietary restrictions like vegan or gluten-free. In other words, it’s possible to thoroughly enjoy eatingandget the most out of your training at the same time, and these cookbooks for runners can help. Unless you’re a pro at making substitutions, you’ll find that some diets, such asvegetarianandketogenicdiets, rule out loads of recipes in the average cookbook. But that doesn’t mean you have to miss out on eating good food: There’s a wealth of protein-filled, balanced meals within any given chosen parameters, including dedicated cookbooks stuffed with fresh, inventive recipes. More than anything, these books are a great source for inspiration that doesn’t rely on the norms of non-diet meals. Quality cookbooks consist of recipes developed from the ground up, not by modifying an original recipe. This approach can help you perceive your training meals as a choice rather than a compromise—a much-needed morale boost for runners trying a change in diet for the first time. It’s hard to argue that anyone could write a better cookbook than a chef, at least when whipping up something tasty is the sole objective. That said, when athletes write cookbooks, they often frame them around the nutritional makeup of each recipe—macronutrients like carbs and protein, for instance. This may be more important information if you’re, say, figuring out your last dinner before a race. The perfect cookbook for you will take the information you have and give you the information you need. Want to know how many fast-burning carbs you can pack into a tasty marinara sauce? Look for an athlete-authored book. Have a box of protein-rich pasta and no clue what to make with it? Try one written by a chef. Of course, you can also mix and match to maximize your pool of references, or you can look for someone with a bit of both perspectives, like chef-turned-Iron ManGordon Ramsay. There are thousands of cookbooks available online and in bookstores, especially those focused on healthy eating. But many of these books don’t have the information athletes need, many more will try to sell you on an unsustainable fad diet, and lots have only a few good recipes, if any. Not ideal if you’re looking for new mainstay meals. We chose these seven cookbooks based on a combination of positive personal experiences, information quality and density, authorial credibility, and recipe variety. To evaluate the cookbooks we don’t have in our own kitchens, we scoured online copies of bestselling cookbooks marketed to athletes, choosing only the most consistently positively reviewed options (and those that we were the most enthusiastic to try as soon as possible). It’s not often that we get an in-depth look at the nutrition plans of world-class athletes—let alone record-setters like Shalane Flanagan. But for this cookbook, she and chef Elyse Kopecky collected more than 100 of their favorite recipes for fueling even the most intense distance runs. This book also isn’t shy about the realities of healthy food: It delves into topics like the essential nature of fat as a flavor enhancer and a well-rounded diet, the importance of avoiding restrictive diets, and the triviality of stressing about numbers. They also include a recipe for some damn good chocolate cookies, which is always a plus. Vegetarian and vegan diets don’t have to be the lesser siblings of omnivorous diets; in many cases, when you get them right, they can be even better. But because you don’t have a big cut of meat holding up your meal in terms of protein, it can take a more holistic approach to give plant-based recipes depth and character. This cookbook from Matt Frazier and Stepfanie Romine has that approach dialed. This book has creative takes on traditional favorites, like savory chickpea waffles, as well as fresh recipes for staples like morning smoothies. And not only are the recipes in this book fit for any time of day, but they also come jam-packed with info about how to further modify each dish for gluten- and soy-free athletes. Nobody’s tastes are left out here except for, well, meat-eaters. But that’s the point! Not everyone may be aware, but Gordon Ramsay has plenty of authority to write about food that fuels athletes: He’s a serious triathlete when he’s not in the kitchen, and he’s even finished the Kona IronMan. Just a few years after his big Kona finish, he wrote this book with three distinct sections—Healthy, Lean, and Fit—to cater to different health-related goals. Healthy helps you find a stable diet for an energized everyday life, Lean features recipes for people with weight loss goals, and Fit is dedicated to pre- and post-workout meals that fuel your workouts and aid in recovery. One of the tougher things you’ll have to navigate with this book is Ramsay’s tendency to use exotic (or at least exotically phrased) ingredients. If the produce section at your local grocery store is a little lacking, you might struggle to try some recipes without swapping in substitutes. Additionally, be on the lookout for Ramsay’s use of British lingo—a courgette is a zucchini, for example. Keto diets are especially finicky, at least when you’re trying to develop yours from scratch. Entering ketosis requires eating as few carbs as possible, and those can sneak into almost everything the average person eats. To take the guesswork out of staying low-carb, save yourself from another slab of bacon or provolone and try this cookbook. It aims to guide you progressively into a sustainable keto diet instead of thrusting you away from your comfort foods overnight. This book isn’t necessarily written for athletes, but it sets a foundation for a well-rounded keto diet that can adapt with you and your life. Keto isn’t quite everyone’s thing, but if you want to see if it’s yours, this book is the most approachable means of trying it properly. You may knowSalt, Fat, Acid, Heatfrom its accompanying Netflix documentary that released in 2018—it’s an in-depth interrogation of the very fundamentals of good food and what makes us enjoy it. Just like the four-part series, this book tells you how to make any dish good by finding the perfect balance of salt, a flavor enhancer; fat, a texture enhancer; acid, a flavor balancer; and heat, a texture balancer. This book is a stellar addition to your collection if you’re looking to create some recipes from scratch, and it’ll also give you more confidence to modify recipes that are really close to being good but seem to be missing something. This also isn’t explicitly a cookbook for runners, but if you know what food makes you run your best, this book will help you put it all together in a way that tastes amazing. If you likeRun Fast. Eat Slow.but feel like the recipes leave you crunched for time, then this second book from Flanagan and Kopecky should give you what you need. Just like the original, this cookbook for runners is full of hearty recipes that can power you and your family through a big training day, but they take much less time to prepare. If you work full-time and train in the evenings, this book could save your sanity. Another book for the plant-based athletes among us,Eat & Runisn’t actually a cookbook. It’s a memoir containing just a dozen recipes. It chronicles the life of author Scott Jurek as he transitioned from a meat-heavy diet in his youth to a vegan diet that fueled much of his ultrarunning career. If you’re a fan of food that tells a story, the recipes embedded within the story may be right for you. Otherwise, this book is simply a great motivator for athletes struggling to find a diet that works for them, and it’s a poignant read about grappling with family traditions and inviting novel ideas into one’s lifestyle.

Cleaning a yoga mat after use is super important both to keep the yoga mat in good shape and to rid the mat of bacteria and dirt, which can cause acne and irritation to the skin. This one is also made with natural ingredients, so it is gentle on their skin and the mat. Yoga can be hard on the hands, knees, and feet, particularly for those that are newer to the practice or aren't as young as they used to be. A simple fix to make yoga more comfortable is a thicker yoga mat. This one is super thick and provides a cushioned surface without being too soft. Sound baths are a great way to center, relax, and begin a meditation or yoga practice. The sound and vibrations together create a calming feeling, and singing bowls like this have been used for thousands of years. This one is also particularly small, so it fits in a bag and is great for travel. This set includes a set of 14 chakra crystals. Besides just looking pretty, they are also used to stimulate the chakras, which is believed by some to help heal and improve one’s well being. These yoga socks help keep their feet warm, and give some extra grip and support to the feet. They are super stretchy—and while only one size, they can fit from a women’s size 4 up to a men’s size 10.

Are You Drinking Water Wrong?,"According to research, you probably are. Here’s how to make sure your water intake improves your performance. Stayinghydratedseems simple enough—drink water when you’rethirstyand stop when you feel like you’re done, right? Well, it’s a bit more complicated than that, especially forrunners. That’s because not understanding the complicated equation of race distance and intensity combined with water and electrolyte intake can ruin along runorrace, not to mention have serious health repercussions. Drink too little and your ability to power through your workout suffers; drink too much and you can get sidelined bynauseaand frequentpee breaks. And even though you might first worry about dehydration for those summer runs,researchersfound that the newer you are to running and the slower you run, the more likely it is that you will drinktoo muchwater while racing. (We’ll talk more about this later.) To that end, much of the research demonstrates that mastering the art of hydration when you run isn’t as simple as it seems. Keep reading to find out if you drink water the wrong way—and how to drink water right. It’s okay to slow a little to make sure you’re getting in your fluids during a race, but gulping water at each aid station can ultimately slow you down and also lead to an upset stomach. That’s because drinking too much water too quickly overloads the stomach, causing it to rapidly stretch. This can lead to discomfort and potential nausea,Justin Mullner, M.D., a board-certified primary care sports physician with the Orlando Health Jewett Orthopedic Institute in Florida tellsRunner’s World. Take small sips of water (or electrolyte drink) every 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the temperature and intensity of the run. Combining a run with too much water is even more likely to cause nausea. That’s becauseintense exercisedirects blood flow away from the stomach and toward themuscles, causing digestion to slow down. “So you put a bunch of water in there and thestomachreally can’t handle it effectively and efficiently,” Mullner says. A better strategy is to take small sips of water (or electrolyte drink) every 15 to 20 minutes, depending on thetemperatureand intensity of the run. “This approach helps maintain a steady level of hydration and prevents the stomach from becoming overly full,”Meghan Kennihan, a RRCA- and USATF-certified running coach, tellsRunner’s World. Your trustywater bottleis always there when you need it. Sadly, constant use means you’re probably getting more than water. Unless you regularly clean your water bottle—which means daily according to Mullner—you could be getting a dose of bacteria or even mold. Every time you put your mouth to the water bottle and use your hands to open and close it, you transfer bacteria that can make its way inside. The moist environment inside your water bottle provides an optimal breeding ground for bacteria and mold, especially if you live inhot, humidareas. If left unchecked, the bacteria and mold can continue growing, potentially causing you to experience symptoms similar tofood poisoning(such as stomach pain or cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting), per theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. People with mold sensitivities can have a flare-up of allergy symptoms. Ideally, you’d wash out yourreusable bottle—whether plastic, stainless steel, or glass—with soap and warm water each time, Mullner says. “It’s even more important if you’re using the bottle every single day or drinking beverages other than water,” he says. Mixingelectrolyte powdersor adding a sports drink to your bottle, for example, means more material for bacteria. Signs your bottle could use a good scrubbing include visible residue, a funny or foul odor, or changes in how things taste, Mullner says. When preparing for a long run or race, many runners forget to hydrate until they’re practically toeing thestarting line, “which is a bad idea because it doesn’t give the body enough time to absorb and utilize the fluids,” Kennihan says. Staying well-hydrated in the days leading up to your long run or race can help you perform well, avoid feeling overly full, and reduce restroom stops. Be especially diligent about drinking water starting the day before a long run orrace, and check your urine color to be sure you’re getting enough. “Really dark yellow is a sign that you’re not well-hydrated,” Mullner says. “Ideally, it has a slight tinge of yellow.” Drink 16 to 20 ounces of water about 2 to 3 hours beforehand and then another 8 to 10 ounces 20 to 30 minutes before running. Individual fluid needs vary. However, a general guideline for the day of the event is to drink 16 to 20 ounces of water about 2 to 3 hours beforehand and then another 8 to 10 ounces 20 to 30 minutes before running, Kennihan says. You may need to adjust your intake according to your body size, run distance, and outside temperature. It’s critical to drink enough water during long training runs and races. However, drinking lots of water, andonlywater, can lead tooverhydration, meaning you have too much water in your body. Hyponatremia is an extreme version of overhydration, and occurs when sodium levels in the blood are lower than recommended, leading to muscle cramps, headaches, nausea and vomiting, low energy, and confusion, per theCleveland Clinic. Normally, your body keeps your electrolytes in balance by taking the minerals from the foods you eat and filtering the excess through your urine. However, intense exercise causes electrolytes (particularly sodium) to be quickly lost throughsweat, and hot, humid temperatures only accelerate this loss, per theAmerican College of Sports Medicine. It's not just new runners who tend to overhydrate. At the other end of the spectrum, 41 out of 63 finishers at an ultramarathon also finished with mild or severe hyponatremia, according to a 2019Frontiers in Nutritionstudy. Take in electrolytes in addition to water if you’re running for longer than 60 minutes or in hot, humid temperatures. Drinking water without replacing electrolytes dilutes the remaining electrolytes (again,sodiumin particular) in your blood. “You can potentially get yourself into trouble with hyponatremia,” Mullner says. To prevent an electrolyte imbalance, take in electrolytes in addition to water if you’rerunning for longerthan 60 minutes or in hot, humid temperatures. Bring an electrolyte drink, some gels, or another electrolyte supplement. Sports drinksoffer a convenient delivery system for carbs and electrolytes while running. Still, many runners prefer to water things down. “Many sports drinks are too concentrated, leading to stomach cramps and nausea. Diluting them can still provide the necessary electrolytes andcarbohydrateswithout overwhelming the stomach,” Kennihan notes. The optimal ratio of sports drink to water depends on your preferences and the makeup of your drink. Mullner suggests diluting your sports drink to the point where it’s most palatable for you. Diluting sports drinks can still provide the necessary electrolytes and carbohydrates without overwhelming the stomach. The exception: Don’t dilute a sports drink that contains carbohydrates if you’re using it for energy purposes. “Some sports drinks have carbs in there to help extend the amount of time you can perform, and if you’re trying to absorb carbs better, you would have it with some electrolytes,” Mullner says. Adding water can cut down on how many carbs you get per sip, limitingperformancebenefits. Some over-the-counter and prescription medications can affect an athlete’s hydration, says Kennihan. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, can reduce blood flow to the kidneys, which can impair their ability to conserve water and electrolytes, potentially leading to dehydration, especially during prolonged physical activity like running. Similarly, diuretics, which are prescribed for conditions such as hypertension and edema, increase urine production and promote the excretion of water and electrolytes from the body. Increased urine output can lead to a significant loss of fluids and electrolytes, making it easier for runners to become dehydrated, particularly in hot and humid conditions or during long-distance runs. Likewise, antihistamines can reduce saliva production and increase the risk of dry mouth and dehydration, while laxatives can cause increased bowel movements and fluid loss. Lastly, stimulant medications, such as those used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), can increase sweating and fluid loss, potentially leading to dehydration if fluid intake is not adequately maintained. Bottom line:As a runner, remember that hydration is as much a part of your performance as actual time on your feet. The authors of a 2019 article published in theInternational Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolismrecommended that runners develop a “personalized and practiced race plan” to optimize their fluid and carbohydrate intake based not only on their distance and intensity, but also taking into account their body composition, as well as theweatherand other race conditions, such asrefueling stations, at each event.

How to Train for Long Runs Like David Roche,"Maybe you should dial back your training for better performance. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? In August 2024, elite runner David Roche shocked the ultra world and crossed the finish line first at theLeadville 100 race. He also shattered Matt Carpenter’s storied 2005 Leadville 100 course record. Roche finished in15:26:34, while Carpenter had finished in 15:42. Roche’s win and time caught people off guard because it was his first go at the distance, even though he has a long career in the ultrarunning by doing 50Ks and 50 milers. Even more surprising, though, was Roche’s approach to training for the 100-mile race: 10 hours a week, versus that of most of his competitors who typically train 25-plus hours per week. Roche also wears many other hats: coach to other runners, host with his wife,Megan, on the podcastSome Work All Play, and father to a toddler. Like many everyday runners, Roche, 36, must catch his training where he can, which means he must make the most of it. “In the process of going through life and doing what I can, I realized that this is also what worked best for me,” Roche tellsRunner’s World. “Life istraining, too, and ‘life miles’ are not accounted for enough in what leads to adaptation.” If you can relate to this struggle, you will be reassured to know that by following some key principles, you can still reach finish lines and hit lofty goals. “There are many ways to get to your end goal,”Lara Rogers, coach for the Under Armour Mission Run Team tellsRunner’s World. “What works for one person might not work for another. I’ve coached plenty ofrunnerswho thrive on lower volume.” David and Megan Roche put extensive research into their training, as well as that of their clients. Their numerous accomplishments validate their knowledge. David Roche is the 2014 USATFTrail Runnerof the Year at the sub-ultra distance, and a two-time national champion and three-time member of Team USA in Duathlon. Megan Roche is the 2016 USATF Trail Runner of the Year at the ultra and sub-ultra distances. She is a five-time national champion, a North American Mountain Running Champion, and a six-time member of Team USA. She graduated with honors from Duke with a degree in neuroscience and received her M.D. from Stanford Medical School. At Stanford, she also earned a Ph.D. in epidemiology, focused on female athlete health and performance research. In 2024, she launchedHuzzah, sharing female athlete performance science. In the episode “What Just Happened” of their podcast, they break down all the science that went into preparing David Roche for—and helping him get through—this extraordinary accomplishment. As they explain in the intro to their debriefing, a lot has changed in training and performance since 2005 when Carpenter broke his record, including advancements infueling,shoes, andaltitude science. Here are three keys to making the most of your training, no matter how much time you have in your weekly schedule. If you’re dialing back to just a few runs each week, what’s key is making the most of those miles. “Typically, that would look like onelong run, and two sessions that are a bitfaster,” says Rogers. “What’s most important is that you’reconsistent, week after week.” According to Roche, there are too many performance variables in ultras to be sure of what intervention leads to what outcome, so training simply to run farther may not be the best strategy. “The strongest predictive variable of ultra performances in the few studies on the subject is velocity at VO2 max,” Roche explains. “So even though I’m training for an event that lasts all day, I want to make sure that I develop my pure speed and running economy all the way to race day. When there are hundreds of variables we can’t control, VO2 might be one variable that has an outsized impact on all-day endurance performance given how it is related to performance at lower effort levels, too.” According toUniversity of California Health, VO2 max is an important standard for measuring aerobic fitness. The number describes “the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during incremental exercise.” In essence, the higher your VO2 max, the better your athletic performance, although other factors, such as sustainable lactate threshold, motivation, and training are important factors in the process. Therefore, while Roche doesn’t put in the mega miles of his competitors, he does keepspeedand other run styles in his routine. “I’ll incorporatestridesthree or four times a week, usually up hills, and sometimes on flats to keep my nervous system responding,” he explains. “I’ll also do afartlekworkout, usually doing 60- or 90-second intervals. My goal was to come into Leadville as fast as possible in a 5K sense.” ➡ It Works for Marathons, TooSimilarly, consistency, not volume, has worked for 53-year-old Lili Barouch, a Maryland-based cardiologist and parent. Barouch began running in 2006 for fitness, but soon caught the bug to race, working her way up to themarathonby 2009. She eventually qualified forBostonby running just three days a week. “I haverheumatoid arthritis, so I’ve always been careful about my mileage,” she explains. “Early on, I went through several injuries, and I tied them to running consecutive days—it just didn’t work for me.”Through some trial and error, Barouch devised a “less is more” plan that worked for her. During three-days-a-week marathon training, that means a peak period of one long run that never exceeds 50 percent of her weekly mileage, and two others in the range of about seven and nine miles.“When I was working toward my BQ, I’d pick one day to run sometempo, and one day for somespeed workorhill repeats,” Barouch explains. She also includes step-back weeks. Every fourth week or so, she cuts her overall volume by 25 percent to give her body a break from her higher mileage weeks. Roche kept long runs in the equation, too, but dialed those back from the typical ultra-training mileage. “I didn’t go beyond 20 very often,” he says. “When I did, it was with purpose.” To that end, Roche focused a lot ondownhills.“The primary adaptation that is unique to long ultras with vert (altitude) is the demand of eccentric muscle contractions from downhills,” he explains. “On my key long runs, I emphasized doing downhills that are as steep as the steepest I’d see on race day at faster paces than I’d do them on race day. At first, I’d be sore for five days from these runs, as thedelayed-onset muscle sorenesswas extreme and my blood was full of creatine kinase from muscle breakdown. But the “repeated bout effect” from studies indicates that it only takes a few of these steep downhill stimuli to adapt, so I wanted to harness that without overdoing stress on my body.” Rogers says bothcross-trainingand strength training are key to success, especially if you work a desk job and spend a good deal of time sitting. “Go through a basiccore routinethat focuses on yourhipsandglutesa couple times a week,” she recommends. In fact, one of the athletes Rogers coaches placed third at NCAA nationals this year on low mileage. “She supplemented with swimming and beat people running three times as much as her,” Rogers explains. Lili Barouch, 53, also makes cross-training andstrength trainingpart of her regimen for marathon training on lower total mileage. “I also do triathlons, so I’m naturally getting into the pool or on my bike every week,” she explains. “But I also make sure I’m strength training twice a week.” One of these sessions is an hour long, while the other is usually around 30 minutes. The basics count, too. From goodnutritionand hydration, to rest and easy movement to encouragerecovery, consider these “extras” as essentials. “I always fuel my training, which matters for performance,” says Roche. To that point, while Roche didn’t always put in the long miles when he trained, he did study the science for his fueling technique. He details his “slurping” technique of up to 120 grams of carbs (not to mention caffeine intake) in thisInstagrampost. Rogers points out the value in these smaller details. “You can spend all the time and money you want on fancyrecovery tools, but they will deliver little benefit,” she says. “If you’re not covering the basics, it doesn’t matter.”The basics, according to Rogers, are warmups, cooldowns, nutrition, and recovery. Rochepays attention to whether he’s recovering from his efforts and if not, he dials back his training even more. “I use the midnightpeetest,” he says. “If I wake up and limp to the bathroom like a 97-year-old, I’m playing the numbers game wrong.” By putting all the pieces together, your minimalisttrainingcan add up to maximum results—look no farther than Roche to see that proof. “Get creative in the context of your life,” he says. “What works for me might not for someone else, but everyone has some unique way to make the training work.” How to Train For Your First Marathon Benefits of Zone 2 Running Why Is It Hard to Wake Up in the Morning All About Running Tests for Improved Performance All About the MAF Method Training Tweaks That Will Get You to a BQ 5 April Marathons for Runners Shut Out of Boston Marathon Workouts to Get Faster Which Fatigues First: Your Legs or Your Heart?

The 7 Best Hydration Packs Keep You Going On Your Next Long Run,"We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Keep running. Keep drinking. Keep going. You don’t have to be a professional athlete to understand that proper hydration is essential to your health and running performance. Wearing a hydration pack–usually a vest or small backpack with holsters forwater bottles, a large reservoir, or both–ensures you stay hydrated on long runs and lets you sip without losing your stride. It's especially helpful forultramarathonsandtrail runs, where you won’t likely have easy access to water along the way. The best hydration packs are great for short runs too, though: There’s no need to lose momentum if you can drink and run at the same time. Some also have storage for carrying your phone, keys, fuel, and other essentials, eliminating the scourge of bouncing short pockets. Thirsty? Check Out These Hydration Stories:Best Running Belts●Best Hydration Powders●Watch Out For These Dehydration Symptoms in Hot Weather Bottles And Reservoirs Expert recommendations vary widely when it comes to exactly how much water you should drink while running, but when all is said and done, it typically comes down todrinking when you’re thirsty. Most hydration packs come with or can accommodate a pair of water bottles, usually around 17 ounces apiece, which should keep most people hydrated for at least a couple of hours. Larger packs often include a sleeve for a large, soft-bodied water pouch called a reservoir or bladder, which has a hose that runs out of the pack and connects at your shoulder, where there’s a nozzle for easy on-the-go sipping. A standard 3 liter (101 oz) reservoir will give you another four to five hours, though long-distance runners may try to stretch that out over a much longer period. Storage Vs. Weight Hydration packs, generally speaking, fall into two categories. There are lighter “minimalist” hydration vests designed to be as light as possible, holding no more than a pair of water bottles and a small pocket’s worth of storage at most.  These are perfect if you’re going to wear a pack on a short run or to a race. For non-competitive long-distance runs andtrail running, there are also larger hydration packs that offer a fair amount of physical storage. In addition to room for water, they often have pockets and hoops for extra clothing, trekking poles, and any other gear you might want to carry along the way. In either case, you can usually count on having small pockets on the shoulder straps for gels, a phone, and other small necessities. Keep in mind that water and gear are heavy, and the more you carry, the harder you must work when running. That’s probably worth it in the long run, as you can’t perform if you aren’t hydrated and properly equipped. But if you only plan on going for short to medium runs, you likely don’t need the added weight of excesssive cargo or a reservoir and can get by with water bottles just fine. Comfort Most hydration packs offer highly adjustable back and cross-body straps that, along with other fitting elements, help you tailor a snug but comfortable fit that hugs your body without bouncing or shifting. They also typically feature vented panels and lightweight fabrics that wick away moisture and dry quickly. Some are minimalist while others have significantly more backpack-like coverage, which may be more or less comfortable depending on the individual. Most hydration packs are unisex garments, though some manufacturers make hydration packs specifically for women, which can feature cross-body straps tailored to fit around a wider range of chest sizes. As a lifelong trail running enthusiast with a penchant for water, I’ve been using hydration vests and packs for decades. This firsthand experience was bolstered by testing a slew of the latest releases from all the top brands, and by input and testing from theRunner’s Worldeditorial team, which evaluated and put these hydration packs through their paces. In addition to running them through a variety of street and trail routes, we researched the latest features and hydration science and surveyed user reviews on Amazon and other retailers to find the packs that the distance running community loves. Only the models with the best value, technical features, comfort, looks, and ability to haul all your stuff without bouncing made the cut. The Salomon Adv Skin 5 does pretty much everything right. It fits well on both men and women, with front and side compression bungees to reduce bouncing and soft padding that minimizes chafing. It comes with a pair of 17-ounce strap flasks, which allow you to carry enough water for a moderate-length run lasting under two hours. There’s an internal reservoir sleeve as well, so you can add an extra 34-102 ounces (1-3 liters) across all three vessels. It also features six stretchy mesh pockets, giving you plenty of room to stash valuables, a running jacket, and any other small accessories you might want to bring along on a run. While it could use a smidge better ventilation, for our money this is the best hydration pack out there. For less than $100, the Nathan TrailMix is a surprisingly high quality pack. It can carry both water bottles and a 2-liter reservoir, and while you have to supply your own bottles, the bladder is included. There is a fairly large, zipping storage pocket to the rear plus a smaller one at the bottom of the right shoulder strap, and several carabiner clip points along the spine. While it has a fair amount of coverage, the material is breathable and lightweight, clocking in at just 7 ounces without the reservoir. I wore one through a number of hot trail runs and never once felt like it was too hot or heavy. The fit is snug and comfortable, generally speaking, though the chest straps do have a tendency to work loose as you run. All told, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a vest that offers so much at such a reasonable price. Having scoured the world for the lightest hydration vest possible, I can report that this is as close to weightless as it gets without compromising essential features. The size large weighs in at just 7 ounces, which is particularly light when you consider that it’s still reservoir-compatible. It also includes two 17-ounce flasks with a unique leash system that allows you to retract them back into place quickly while on the go. There are even a couple of zipping pockets and slots for gels. One thing to keep in mind: When your vest is this light, it tends to bounce a bit more than the average pack. Even with that extra movement, though, the fit is adjustable and stays comfortable mile after mile. Small and sleek, the Nathan Quickstart 2.0 is made for intense short-to-medium distance runs. Its comfortable, lightweight design features, outstanding ventilation, and reliable moisture-wicking will help to keep you cool and dry. It comes with a 50-ounce reservoir, and has strap pockets that allow you to add a pair of extra 22-ounce water bottles. While it offers five pockets of various sizes for fuel, keys, and other small items, its non-liquid storage capacity feels limited compared to our other picks. Since you probably don’t want to carry much during a race, we think that makes it a perfect fit for competition. The further into the backcountry your trail run brings you, the more stuff you’ll need to bring along. The Distance 4 vest from Black Diamond gives you lots of storage space forenergy gelsand other gear. It has a special easy-access holster forhiking poles, and a zip-up security pocket in the back to hold your keys and cards. The design is well-ventilated and fits snugly around your torso. There’s a sleeve for an optional bladder if you want to add one; between that and the two included 17-ounce soft flasks, you’ll be able to carry more than enough water to get you out of the woods. The Ultimate Direction Xodus features a maximalist design that caters specifically to ultramarathoners. It comes equipped with everything you could possibly need on the trail, including nine perfectly placed storage pockets on the front and two large pockets on the back. It has the capacity to hold two 17-ounce bottles and a 51-ounce reservoir. The customizable trekking pole hoops allow you to adjust to your preferred placement. Reflective elements boost low-light visibility, and the fit is perfectly snug with no bounce. Despite offering so much, the vest is incredibly light and breathable. It almost feels like wearing a minimalist vest. The cut is short, minimizing weight and skin coverage. There’s so much vest to it, but it never feels that way no matter how many miles you’ve run. If you’re looking for a hydration pack for a more leisurely hike, check out the Lagos from Cotopaxi. It’s got plenty of storage, with a 1.5-liter cargo area with interior organizer and several exterior pockets, mesh stashes, and clips. It carries a custom 2.5 L reservoir and has a sleeve that can hold a 22-ounce water bottle. The shoulder harness is ventilated and comfortable enough for hours of hiking, and there are straps at the chest and hips for a more secure fit. The Lagos is also offered in a range of Cotopaxi’s characteristically eye-catching colors and, what’s more, it’s made using the brand’s comparatively sustainable, ethical production process so you can feel good about wearing it. How should a hydration pack fit? When adjusting your hydration pack before a run, you want to make sure it’s tight enough to fit snuggly against your torso so that it won’t bounce, without tightening to the point where it pinches or chafes. Do I need to wear a shirt if I’m wearing a hydration pack? Not necessarily. Most hydration packs will fit nicely with or without a shirt, so it’s entirely up to you. A tight-fitting shirt can minimize chafing, though some people find that the added layer adds unwanted rubbing. If you aren’t sure what you prefer, try both and see what works for you. It’s worth keeping in mind that many hydration packs offer enough storage that you can stop and take off your shirt mid-run if you start to feel uncomfortable. How much cargo should you carry on a long run? The longer and more difficult your route, the more important it is to carry water, fuel, poles, emergency supplies, and other gear. That said, you should generally try to stay as light as possible on a long run. It’s going to take some trial and error before you dial in your perfect cargo load. Do not skimp on supplies if you’re pushing yourself on a longer run. Lightweight is great, but you don’t want to find yourself dangerously unprepared.

"How to Train, Fuel, and Plan Your Recovery for an Ultramarathon","If you get to the end of a race and want to keep going, you may be ready for an ultramarathon. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Courtney Dauwalter had an extraordinary 2023—she was the first athlete to winWestern States 100,Hardrock 100and the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) in the same year—those races are ultramarathons—each just over 100 miles. Feel inspired by greats like Dauwalter or your running friend who casually runs ultras for fun? Great! You will likely be happy to know that Dauwalter is not aggressive about her training. Keep that in mind and maybe you, too, can run an ultramarthon. The number of runners taking on ultras is on the rise. In fact, more than 611,000 runners participated in ultras in 2020, according toa surveyfrom RunRepeat and theInternational Association of Ultrarunners. As you can imagine, finding alocationto run 100 miles can be a challenge, and that’s one reason most ultramarathons areoff-road. Also, because they take so long, there are pre-dawn start times, too, and, yes, they take a long time—Dauwalter’s record-setting Western States run took over 15 hours. How long does it take the averagerunner? Somewhere between 24 and 36 hours. With so few participants and such a long time on the course, one thing ultramarathoners notice is a lot of camaraderie in their sport. “The vibe on the course is super-friendly and supportive. Often, it feels like a progressive dinner party under the stars as you move from aid station to station with yourpacers,crew, and newly made friends,” Susie Crossland-Dwyer, an ultrarunner, coach, and founder ofstudio s, a strength, Pilates, and run coaching studio in Cincinnati tellsRunner’s World. She’s coached runners, including ultrarunners, for more than 15 years and in 2017, ran six mountain ultramarathons on five continents. “I often find myself thinking of ultramarathoning as a different sport thanroad runningbecause the focus of most athletes is altogether different,” Crossland-Dwyer adds. “The community and non-competitive element of ultrarunning tends to be front and center.” Sounds pretty welcoming when you put it that way. Keep reading for more about what exactly makes ultrarunning unique and how to prep for anultramarathon. An ultramarathon is any distance longer than amarathon—26.2 miles. Some popular races are 100 miles while others are 200-plus miles over multiple days. The shortest traditional ultramarathon is50K, or 31 miles. That’s a great place to start if you’re a marathoner looking to dip your toes in the ultrarunning water, says Don Reichelt, who has placed first in races like the 2019 Lean Horse 100 and the 2022 Coldwater Rumble 52 miler; his personal best in the 100-miler is 13:16:55 (that’s an average 7:58 per mile pace). The biggest difference betweenultramarathonsand traditional marathons is the complexity of the training schedule, says Reichelt, and that most ultras aretrail-based. If you’re interested in tackling an ultramarathon, you’ve likely crossed the finish line of at least one, if not several,marathons—and that’s very important. So is progressing tolonger distancesgradually. “I encourage athletes to have a few seasons ofmarathon runningunder their belt before jumping to ultra-distances, and I like to see athletes sequentially increase their training volume ormileageover multiple seasons when moving from the marathon to ultras,” says Crossland-Dwyer. “This aids withinjury preventionand helps athletes learn how to handle multiple hours of running before layering on new elements liketrail-running technique, varied terrain, elevation gain and loss, andaltitude.” Another significant part of making sure you’re ready to take on an ultra is to start preppingmentally, and a good place to start is on the sidelines of an ultramarthon. “For someone new to ultras, the first thing you should do is volunteer to crew, pace, or work an aid station at an ultramarathon,”Mark Wooten,Life Timerun coach and ultrarunner who’s done races like the Badwater Ultra tellsRunner’s World. You’ll understand how importantmental toughnessand a solid race strategy are to finishing an ultramarathon. Ultras may sound like a totally different beast than themarathon—and they are—but training for one isn’t all that different. “Don’t expect to spend four times the amount of hours training for a 100-miler because it’s four times as long as a standard marathon,” says Wooten. “In terms of training time, amarathon planand an ultramarathon plan would generally be about the same amount of weekly hours. The big misconception to clear would be the idea that training would be proportional to distance.” That being said, thetype of runningyou do will shift somewhat. There may be some back-to-backlong runson consecutive days to prep your body to run ontired legs, though you don’t need to do that every week. Wooten says there’s varying schools of thought regarding twolong runsper week. “Some runners and coaches swear by them and have success this way,” he says. “For my personal training plans, I subscribe to the school of thought ofquality over quantity, and one long run per week is sufficient.” Figuring out what works best for you might take some trial and error in training. You might not incorporatespeedworkevery week, or if you do, the paces will be less aggressive (no sprint repeats necessary when you’re training to cover 50 or 100 miles). “The biggest shift most marathoners have to make when transitioning to ultras is not focusing as much on standardtraining pacesbut getting more acquainted with running comfortably,” says Crossland-Dwyer. Any speedwork you do will also be longer. “For an ultrarunner, timing a5Kor10Kcould count as speedwork as it would still be significantly faster than race pace,” says Wooten, who says the goal of speedwork during ultra training is just to make race pace feel more sustainable over those long miles. Yourtraining plancan and should vary a lot, depending on what race you’re prepping for and what the terrain will be like. If your race is ontrails, you should aim to go off-road for at least one run per week. And if the course is mountainous, practicing similar changes inelevationduring training is also a smart move, Crossland-Dwyer says. When you domove to the trails, don’t be disappointed if you can’t maintain your regular on-road pace; most runners slow down by 20 to 30 percent or even more when moving to trails, she adds. Also, make a point of getting in regularstrengthandmobility training, advises Reichelt, who does at least a few minutes ofstrength trainingmost days. “Ultrarunning can and will highlight any weaknesses or asymmetries in your body,” he says. “Basicbodyweight strength trainingand regularmobilitywork can help keep those issues away.” Finally, it’s important to note that because most people who run ultramarathons have a strong running base and regularly clock long miles, an ultramarathon training plan is much less structured. “Training duration is one area where the typical marathoner versus the typical ultramarathoner differ in the greatest of ways.Marathon training plansare much more rigid and analytical versus ultramarathon plans that are loose with lots of flexibility,” Wooten says. “Flexible training plansare also further supported because, for most ultramarathoners, a finish is a win.Seconds don’t matter as much, and themental strengthto finish has more value than physical strength.” “For ultras, we’re generally running at aneasier pace; therefore, ourstride lengthisn’t as long, which means less ground impact force,” Wooten explains. “We’re also incorporating walks into our weekly mileage, which are naturallylower impact, and we typically do a large portion of our mileage on a softer dirt surface that’s much more forgiving than concrete.” This schedule, terrain, and intensity allows for some built-in recovery for your ultramarathon training, which can help you sidestepinjury. But you’re still running very long distances, so you need yourrest timeto live up to your mileage. That means you can consider training for an ultra as your hall pass to soak upallthe R&R.Massages,foam rolling, and getting plenty ofquality sleepare all important for helping your body bounce back from all the miles. Don’t skip out onactive recovery, either, like arestorative yogaclass, easy-paced bike ride, or swim in an extra-cold pool. “Those will all pay big dividends in arriving to the starting line feeling strong,” says Wooten. While there isn’t tons of research on the prevalence of injuries among ultramarathoners, studies do suggest they may be more prone to injuries than their shorter distance running counterparts. Onesystematic review and meta-analysispublished in 2015 found that ultramarathoners had a mid-event injury rate of more than 65 percent, while marathoners had a mid-race injury rate of just under 8 percent. However, onestudyfound that ultrarunners who do single-day events, like a 65K race, are more prone to injuries, compared to those doing multi-day events. The researchers speculate this is because those single-day runners are more likely to hold aggressive paces. These stats just reiterate the importance ofrecovery, easy-day paces,slow mileage buildup, and paying attention to how your body feels during training. Fueling up to get through more miles than a marathon is a crucial element of ultras, and one that’s very tricky to figure out. “Finding the right balance of fueling over eight, 12, or 24-plus hours is an art form,” says Crossland-Dwyer. “Many athletes’stomachsfail them long before their legs give out.” You’ve perfected your ideal mix of gels and gummies to get you through 26.2 miles, but 50 or 100? Don’t even try to cover that distance with nothing butelectrolytecandies in your pocket. Those simply won’t supply enough energy to get you to the finish line, and your stomach likely won’t tolerate them for hours upon hours. As a general rule, aim to eat something every 30 minutes and sipsports drinkor something with calories constantly, suggests Wooten. A good place to start is alternating some sports gummies or gels with “real” food from aid stations: Ultra courses are stocked with everything from pretzels and grilled cheese tochicken broth, noodles, soda, and more. Plus, says Wooten, before the race you can drop off your own bags with any special items you think you might want to down at various points throughout the course. “The pace is so aggressive in a marathon that quick andsimple sugarsare the only way to keep up with the demand. In an ultra, because of the slower pace, the calorie-per-minute burn is not as steep and theheart rateis so far fromanaerobicthat body fat is helping to supply some of the caloric demand,” Wooten explains. “Fats,starches, andgrainsbecome the go-to fuels over simple sugars.” As with marathon training, you want to practice your ultrarunningnutrition strategyduring your training so you get used to eating these new foods on the go and also test what works best for your body and gut before race day. “The best way to learn [how to run an] ultra is to get out there, try things, and limit the mistakes each additional time you go out byjournalingthe good and bad during each run,” says Reichelt. But there are a couple things that set any ultramarathon race day apart from shorter distances. For one, many ultras start before dawn to give runners time to finish by a set cut-off time—so you may berunning in the darkfor a good chunk of time. Also, know that many races have multiple time cut-offs throughout the race, notes Crossland-Dwyer, which means you have to hit certain mile markers at a certain time. If you hope to run competitively in an ultra, keep in mind that you’ll likely need to run by feel or byheart raterather than sticking to onegoal pacefor the majority of the race, she says: “In order to do well, competitive ultrarunners will say, ‘I don’t necessarily need to run the fastest—I just need to slow down the slowest.’” There’s a lot you can prepare for leading up to an ultra, but at the end of the day, says Reichelt, you should prepare to be surprised. “I’ve run countless ultras and run over 100 miles 13 times now, and I’m still learning new things tooptimize my own performance,” he says. “The only thing that doesn’t surprise me anymore is that something will go wrong during an ultra—and your ability to overcome it will determine your results.” Learning from each ultra race you run will inform what you do at the next one. Consider yourprerace ritual,pacingover the course of the mileage, tacklinghills, your food andfluid intake—paying attention to all of these variables can lead to a better ultra your next time at the starting line. But what surprised Reichelt most after his first ultra? The people. “Nearly everyone is kind and wants to see you succeed,” he says. So even if you’re nervous about lining up to the start of your first ultramarathon, know there will be plenty of people out there to support you.

The 30 Best Gifts for New Runners,"These gifts for new runners will be a hit this holiday season and beyond. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? As with any sport, it takes time and practice to nail the ins and outs of your running routine. For runners who are just starting out, they might not know what they really need aside from a pair ofrunning shoes. Luckily, here atRunner’s Worldwe have tons of experience with gear designed for top athletes as well astotal newbies, and everyone in between. We’ve gathered a list of the best gifts for new runners that you could get a friend or family member that they probably haven’t even considered—thinkhydration packsandcompression socks. To find the best gifts for new runners, we looked at our favorite products to find the best options for newly-minted runners. We also put ourselves in the shoes of beginner runners to think about what they may have forgotten to buy before starting their journey on the trails. New runners might not be completing marathons right away, however, thismedal holdercan serve as a source of inspiration. This stainless steel holder can hold up to 60 medals and has an inspirational quote for an added touch. Plus, it comes with metal display screws that go straight into the wall for easy and sturdy assembly. One key component to a successful run is comfort from head to toe—especially toe. Made from merino wool, nylon, and elastane, theseeditor-approvedsocks are soft and comfortable enough for short and long runs. Plus, with mesh ventilation zones, these socks are highly breathable so they won’t feel as sweaty during a workout. They are available in women’s sizes 4 to 12.5. While running sneakers are essential, it’s easy for the newbies to forget about recovery. Theseeditor-recommended recovery slidesare made with a sugarcane EVA midsole and outsole to provide the feet with optimal cushion and supportideal for recovery. Aside from being comfortable, they have air flow channels designed to keep feet cool and moisture-free all day long. Every new runner needs a pair of headphones to keep them motivated while out for a run. Theseeditor-approvedwireless headphones will do the trick with active noise cancellation and water protection, whether that’s from sweat or rain. The best part? They won’t fall out thanks to the extra grippy material so your giftee won’t have to worry about losing a headphone (or two). When the cold weather comes around, your giftee will welcome anything that can provide them with a bit of extra warmth, including this fleece headband. Available in blue, gray, and white, this headband is designed to keep ears warm while wicking away moisture. It’ll even stay in place for the duration of a run with its fleece trim so it won’t get in the way of vision or speed. There’s always the chance of unexpected weather while out on a run, so arain jacketis always great to have on hand. This is an inexpensive so it’s perfect for keeping as a spare in your car, but you’ll have to pay more for a running-specific jacket with armpit vents. Made from nylon, this rain jacket is lightweight and has an adjustable drawcord hem to keep a tight seal around the body for optimal dryness. Additionally, any runner will appreciate the tiny pockets suitable for a gel shot or phone. Staying hydrated is key to a successful and safe run, especially in warmer temperatures. Thiseditor-approvedhydration belt offers one-handed access to flasks while on the move without coming out of place. It’s also stretchy enough so runners won’t feel the bounce of the bottles against their body as they move so a more peaceful run can ensue. Every runner needs a running belt to keep their essentials on them without the added bulk. This comfy belt lays flat on the hips and has four pockets to hold the essentials including a phone, keys, cards, etc. It can also serve as a piece of safety gear with its reflective logo to keep runners visible while out early in the morning or late at night. Choose from 11 colors ranging from aqua blue to reflective black. Some runners might enjoy taking their activity to the trails for a change of scenery, pace, and be more connected with nature.  Made from recycled materials, these shoes offer an active outsole and upper which providecontrolled grip and stabilityon various terrain while bringing natural mobility to the forefront. These are great for individuals with wide feet, or people who like extra room in the toe box. Many runners prefer tackling their runs early in the morning or late at night. While that can be less crowded and more peaceful, it also makes you more susceptible to blending in with your surroundings, which can be dangerous. Thisrechargeable headlampcan provide bright luminous light for up to two hours and stays in place with its sweat-resistant silicone. There are four different light modes and three brightness levels so runners can adjust accordingly based on their comfort level. There’s nothing wrong with smelling a bit funky after a run, but having a powerful deodorant can be helpful. Made with coconut oil and shea butter, Native’s unscented deodorant stick provides effective protection against unwanted odor while leaving the skin soft and smooth. Additionally, it’s free from parabens, aluminum, and other potentially harmful ingredients. One can never have too many pairs of running socks, right? These no-show socks provide heel and toe cushioning and a locked-in fit to keep them in place. They are sold as a six-pack so your giftee will be loaded for nearly every day of the week after receiving this. They also come from one of our favorite running gear brands, Brooks. For the runners who like energy drinks, these gel pouches are a happy medium, giving an extra boost without added caffeine. The crushable texture makes it easy to drink while on the go and they are free from artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup. Runners can choose from three flavors—apple, strawberry, or white grape—based on their taste preferences. New runners are bound to overdo it every once in a while, andfoam rollerscan help work out muscle tension and pain. Unlike other foam rollers, this one is wrapped with EVA foam making it more durable and suitable for consistent use. They’ll love how it mimics the feelings of a masseuse’s hands at a fraction of the cost. Compression sockscan help to prevent muscle fatigue and fluid accumulation while promoting blood flow—but they’re usually pretty ugly. These festive socks buck that norm, and they’re great for post-run movement and rest as they can help soothe aching legs, sore feet, and random muscle twinges while your body recovers. There’s nothing worse than being out for a run when your thighs start tochafe together, opening up a fresh wound out of nowhere. Help a new runner prevent this uncomfortable sensation with this editor-recommendedanti-chafing stickdesigned to create a friction-free barrier on the skin. It’s made with aloe, pomegranate, and grapeseed oil to soothe the skin while leaving it moisturized and protected from excess moisture and sweat. Opt for this pair of gloves that can help keep hands warm in the coolest of temperatures. Not only are they insulated, but also water-repellent so if bad weather arises while outside it doesn’t serve as a hindrance. If your giftee likes to change the tunes while on a run, they are touchscreen-friendly so they can do it without taking them off. Rx Bars are the perfect snack to fuel-up for a run with only natural ingredients that can actually be pronounced. Find flavors like chocolate sea salt, chocolate coconut, blueberry, and peanut butter. These are great to eat for breakfast alongside a cup of coffee for a boost of energy to tackle those miles. There’s only so much wisdom an individual can bestow on a new runner, but a good book can be what they need to get even more motivated. This book touches on five ways to improve mental fitness which in turn can help with physical performance. It’s a solid reach for a trip to the beach or a long train ride when there’s no signal. Some people find it helpful to keep track of their time and speed in a tangible journal. This journal provides space for up to 140 days of tracking with space to jot down personal records, body measurements, progress, and other notable statistics. It also provides some guidance with goal prompts that can motivate runners to get out there and achieve them without holding back.

We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? If 2018 was the year ofmindset and mental toughness, 2019 may be the year of books on Olympians and evidence-based practices. Here are nine running-related reads I plan to add to my bookshelf over the next 12 months. As buzzy asrecoveryis among athletes right now, the question of how to best adapt to and benefit from training is still fraught with confusion.FiveThirtyEightscience writer Christie Aschwanden offers much-needed clarity on the subject inGood to Go. From Gatorade to cryotherapy, Tom Brady’sinfrared pajamasto Simone Biles’s pneumaticcompression boots, Aschwanden investigates the latest trends in recovery, often playing the guinea pig herself.Good to Goultimately aims to resolve which recovery products and practices are worth our time and money. (February 5 publication) Running Home, formerOutsidewriter Katie Arnold’s first book, explores an issue that many runners will relate to: the healing powers of putting one foot in front of the other, over and over again. In the wake of her father’s shocking death and the anxiety that grips her one year later, Arnold’s only solace comes from solo long runs through the wilderness. Recognizing that, she turns to ultra-distance trail running as an outlet for grief and a space for self-reflection.Running Homeis a personal illustration of the benefits of running thatscience now suggests. (March 12 publication) Four-time Olympian Meb Keflezighi is not only prolific over the 26.2-mile distance; the March publication of26 Marathonswill be Keflezighi’s third book, and his first since announcinghis retirement from racing. In26 Marathons, Keflezighi invites the reader onto the roads beside him as he journeys back through each of his professional marathons. From his 2002 debut to his 2017 retirement, Keflezighi revisits the races that now comprise a legendary career: debilitating injuries, historic victories, an Olympic podium, and all of the miles in between. (March 19 publication) The team behind the 2017 hitPeak Performancereturns in 2019 with a spin-off:The Passion Paradox. As in their first collaboration, coauthors and coaches Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness weave together real-world examples with the latest science, this time to unravel the concept of passion and debunk the assumption that a balanced approach is best. Whether you’re an athlete or an executive, expect to glean evidence-based advice for identifying, developing, and sustaining the “right” kind of passion. (March 19 publication) Kim Conley may not be an underdog anymore, having made the 2012 and 2016 U.S. Olympic teams at 5,000 meters. But in Tom Flynn’sUnderdog, we learn how Conley transcended a rather ordinary college running career to become one of the fiercest track athletes in the country. Drawing from Conley’s memories, journals, and running logs, Flynn—who has also written books on baseball and lacrosse—chronicles her emergence as a professional runner, giving special attention to the “underdog moments” that have come to define her career. (April 1 publication) Two-time Olympian and American record-holder Ryan Hall is back—but not on the roads, as much as his fans would love it. While Hall’s first book,Running with Joy, chronicled his daily life and training regimen as a professional, his follow-up offers a reflection on his 20-year running career from a markedly different perspective. As a coach, speaker, nonprofit partner, and adoptive father to four sisters from Ethiopia, Hall shares lessons learned on his path to international running success and the faith to which he attributes it all. (April 16 publication) In recent years, ultrarunning has gone from niche to mainstream, with hundreds of thousands of participants worldwide.

Backed by scientific research as well as anecdotal evidence from some of the world’s top performers—from artists and inventors to athletes and forecasters—David Epstein makes the case for a generalized approach, and the failure, exploration, and creativity that go with it. Among the running community,Rangemay be especially interesting to parents wondering how to set up their children for success down the road. (May 28 publication)  One of the most comprehensive and trusted resources for marathoners,Advanced Marathoningis undergoing its second revision since its original 2001 publication. Coauthors Pete Pfitzinger, twice the top American in the Olympic marathon, and Scott Douglas, author ofseveral popular running books, offer a number of changes that reflect the latest scientific research and best practices for runners. Among them are a new chapter for masters marathoners; major revisions to the nutrition and supplementary/non-running training chapters; the latest on the psychological side of marathoning; advice forusing GPS dataand other technological advances; and further guidance on adjusting training as necessitated by illness, injury, and other life demands.

Watch Jim Walmsley Attempt—and Fail—at the Hardrock 100 Route Record,"We know what it looks like when a record attempt goes well. Here’s what it looks like when ... it doesn’t. It’s the year offastestknowntimes(FKTs), and we’ve seen countless records taken down all over the country and the world. We’ve also seen some attempts not pan out as planned. Courtney Dauwaulter ended up in the hospital after attempting an FKT on the Colorado Trail in July. We also sawWestern States record holderJim Walmsley crash out of his attempt to break theHardrock 100route record of 22 hours and 41 minutes, set by Kilian Jornet in 2014. These efforts are tough (the Hardrock 100 course alone has 33,050 feet of elevation gain), and while we often see what happens when these runs go right, we don’t often get to peek behind the curtain to see how tough these attempts really are. But with Walmsley’s latest attempt, we get to see his entire quad-burning, stomach-upsetting try at the record. Alongside Walmsley’s crew in the San Juan Mountains wasStephen Kersh, a fellow Flagstaff, Arizona, resident and writer/director forRabbitWolf Creativewho filmed the entire run. In classic Walmsley fashion, he cruised on record pace through the first half of his run, but he ran into trouble when night fell. Unable to get down nutrition, he and Tim Freriks, his pacer at the time, made the call to pull the plug on the race. Walmsley then spent a good chunk of the evening (around four hours) in a bathroom on the trail. There’s plenty more action, but we’ll let Kersh’s recap in the documentary above tell the full story. Extreme distances and challenges are not foreign to the 30-year-old. Walsmley has been on a tear in the ultrarunning world for years, with his most famous races coming at Western States in California. We’ve also seem him take onUltra-Trail du Mont-Blanc,capture the Grand Canyon R2R2R FKT in 2016, andeven taking 22nd at the Olympic Marathon Trials this past Februarywhen we made a quick detour back to the roads.

Mastering Running as You Age,"Successful runners keep competing by adapting and reinventing themselves at each age milestone. Running, it is often said, is a lifelong sport. You can start as early as grade school and keep going as long as you can put one foot in front of the other. You grow, mature, set PRs and (hopefully) break them again and again. But there comes a time when the PR chase grows difficult, except for those who entered the sport later in life and are still relatively new to it. And even those runners have to accept the fact that try as they might to keep fit and youthful, their bodies inexorably decline. It's a process that on average begins sometime in our 30s. The rate of decline gradually increases to about 0.7 percent per year (with slight variations among events and between men and women) throughout our 40s, 50s and 60s, according to the current (2010) version of the age-grading tables maintained by World Masters Athletics (available online through numerous age-grading calculators). The reasons for this decline are mixed and not terribly well-understood from a basic physiological level. What is known is that age lowers VO2max and decreases muscle mass. Accumulated wear and tear makes you less flexible. All forms of healing take longer, including recovery from hard workouts, something you can't ignore unless you want to spiral into an endless cycle of overtraining and injury. The good news is that it could be worse. At the 2014 Twin Cities Marathon, 59-year-old Christine Kennedy of Los Gatos, California, ran an age-defying 2:59:39, a time many runners half her age only dream of. ""Humans are well-adapted to run into late middle age,"" says Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University who figured prominently in the bestselling bookBorn to Runby Christopher McDougall. In fact, says Lieberman, who has spent part of his career studying pre-industrial cultures, our ancestors appear to have evolved to continue running or hunting well into today's masters years. ""Hunter/gatherers who survive childhood often live into their 70s or even 80s and remain very active,"" he says. That does not mean, however, that the biology of aging can be ignored. It's still necessary to adjust your training—and your expectations—to the realities of getting older. Those adjustments differ as you progress along the masters path. It's tempting to deny that age has any effect at the lower end of this range. After all,Meb Keflezighi'sPR win atBostoncame only weeks before his 39th birthday, and many runners continue to improve during their late 30s. But the two oldest Olympic gold medalists were Carlos Lopes (marathon, 1984) and Constantina Dita (marathon, 2008), both 38 at the time of their wins. ""The magic number is 39 to 40,"" says Mark Cleary, coach of the So Cal Track Club. ""I know guys who run really fast at 38, then all of a sudden say, 'Now I know what you're talking about.' "" Some spend their early masters career bemoaning every race as a new PW—personal worst. Others embrace it, counting the days until their 40th birthday when they have a chance to set records in a new category. Amy Begley, a 2008 Olympian and now head coach of the Atlanta Track Club, says every athlete has to deal with change. ""There was a high point, and now they have to reset the goals,"" Begley says. Her husband, Andrew, another coach with the club, faced similar issues earlier than most, when a knee injury in his 20s took him out of elite competition. ""My advice is to learn to race against yourself,"" he says. (Get training plans to Run Strong in Your 40's, 50's, and 60's.Shop Now) One way to measure that personal competition is by using predictor workouts, then trying to beat the prediction. Andrew Begley used the Mile Down workout, starting with 1600m, then working down: 1200-800-600-400-300-200m. ""When you add up all of the times for this workout, I could run within 20 to 30 seconds of that for a 5K race,"" he says. ""So when I got into the race, I was trying to run a little faster than predicted. If I could look myself in the mirror after my race and tell myself that I worked hard and didn't quit, it was a victory."" In terms of training, the changes at this early stage in masters running are relatively minor. Realize that injuries can be more frequent and take longer to heal. ""Extra recovery time needs to be built in,"" Amy Begley says. ""You may wind up doing more cross-training."" And women, in particular, need to be aware of the risk of declining bone mass. ""I encourage lifting exercises to keep up density in the upper body and spine,"" she says. Priorities for a Young Masters Runner While the increase in recovery time and the decline in top performances are impossible to ignore, this age can be one of the most rewarding of a runner's life. Each age group represents a chance to be the young runner again, providing anticipation as the turn-year approaches and offering the thrill of setting new marks and competing for awards as you enter the new group. Some people who had busy family lives when they were younger may suddenly find new time for training. Consider Colleen Rocereto of Tigard, Oregon. At 49, with the last of her three sons in college (and a 40:56 10K already in her arsenal), she has started joining groups—one on the track and another for weekend runs—in preparation for seeing what she can do in the 50–54 age group. The opportunity to do such workouts with partners, rather than just running out the door, has opened a new window on her training. ""I feel like I can get faster and stronger,"" she says. Another motivation is simply to beat the age-grading curve. In fact, you can easily channel the energy you once put into chasing PRs into chasing age-graded PRs, with similar, if not greater satisfaction as you defy the hands of time. But this is also the age when masters reality truly sets in. Not only do you have to be exceptional to still be fighting for the type of position you might once have had among the open-class runners, but if you haven't already adjusted training to accommodate your changing body, you're in danger of spending this decade fighting off injuries. ""Keep health before fitness,"" Cotner says. ""If you're always having to compromise workouts by what hurts, you're not going to get very far."" Part of staying healthy is maintaining muscle strength and flexibility. ""That's a real change from a number of years ago,"" says Bob Williams, a Portland, Oregon, coach. ""People are now in the gym—they're really doing it."" Two muscle groups of particular importance are the calves and hip flexors. For the calves, the most common problems are inflexibility and muscle pulls. But aging calves can also lose power. To see if this applies to you, Cotner suggests finding a steep hill and running up it, counting strides. He uses a hill that's about 500 meters long, with a grade of 12 to 14 percent, but there's no magic to that formula, especially in places where long, steep hills are hard to find. What matters is that the fewer strides it takes to cover the course, the more power you have in your calves—and that you repeat this test on the same hill periodically to see whether you're improving, declining or maintaining. As for hip flexors, they are the muscles that help lift your knees and swing them forward between strides—meaning that there is a strong correlation between hip flexor strength and running speed. But they can lose strength and flexibility, especially if your job entails increasing amounts of sitting as you get older. Tight hip flexors can also lead to hamstring problems. That's because the hip flexors attach to the pelvis and to several vertebrae of the lower back. When they get tight, Cotner says, they change the tilt of the pelvis. The result is a reduced ability to activate the glute muscles, less hip extension (the upper leg going out behind) and hamstrings that are overstretched and weak—so much so that Cotner sees the combination of these problems as a common syndrome. The solution to any of these problems, of course, is strength and flexibility training. You can no longer get away with perfunctory stretches and just running. All those articles about supplemental training that you ignored in your 20s now make the difference between continuing as a successful racer and dropping out with injury or dropping off with a compromised stride. Other training tips for runners in this age group are simpler. Pretty much every coach, for example, recommends spending as much time as possible on soft surfaces. ""Run too much pavement,"" Cleary says, ""and your days are numbered."" He feels that even tempo runs should be on a track, trail or other soft surface. ""I'll do 24 laps around a sports park, on grass,"" he says. Cleary is 56; if you insist on spending all your time pounding the pavement, he says, ""I'll be running 10 years from now when you're not."" Priorities for a Middle Masters Runner To begin, the 55-59 age group is the first to show a truly marked drop-off in the number of competitors. For example, in 2014, the 9,000-runner California International Marathon saw only 397 combined male and female finishers at ages 55-59, compared to 702 in the 50-54 group and 915 in the 45-49 group. By 60-64, the number of finishers had plummeted to 189. Other than praying you have good genes and doing your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle, there's not a lot you can do to keep yourself from joining the ranks of those sidelined by arthritis and other nonrunning ailments. But if you're one of those people who is never happy with your race results, this might be a good time to start acknowledging the successes you've already had, before the unpleasant time comes—however far in the future—when there are no more successes. ""I am appreciating my past times more than I did when I ran them,"" says Suzanne Ray, who lt age 62, set the course record for 60-plus at the California International Marathon with a 3:24:01. ""The key to longevity in running is joy,"" she says. But this doesn't mean you can't still strive for improvement. Running, Ray says, is as much about meeting your own goals as it is about beating your rivals, which means the drive to constantly seek more from yourself is ""almost essential."" Also important to realize is that the 0.7 percent annual decrease in performance translates to 3.5 percent over the course of each five-year age group. The youngsters in your age group are now 20–30 seconds per mile ahead of you, and it's easy to get frustrated. ""The last two years in the age group can be tough,"" says Mark Cleary, coach of the So Cal Track Club. One way to deal with this is simply to wait it out until the next key birthday rolls around. Another is to use the upcoming age group as an incentive. That's useful, Williams says, because ""you need to ramp up a year or so early to really be effective.""(Get training plans to Run Strong in Your 40's, 50's, and 60's.Shop Now) Meanwhile, you do need to make some training changes. One is to recognize that just as masters runners don't recover as easily as open-class runners, older masters runners don't recover as quickly as younger ones. You have to become more adept at monitoring and judging your recovery, not relying on timing rules or other runners' experiences. ""The key is only to do the next workout when you're recovered,"" Cotner says. ""In some cases it's only a day or two longer than in the 30s and 40s. Sometimes it can be a whole week."" Cleary adds that this is a good time to start taking extra rest days, even if that means taking two or three days off in a row if you feel a warning twinge. ""I've learned that being in the game is more important than trying to push and not being able to compete,"" he says. In his coaching, he's adopted the same attitude. ""I tell them, when in doubt, do a pool workout. That has saved more butts than I can tell you."" If the idea of backing off makes you feel lazy, Tom McGlynn, founder of the online training program called Runcoach, has a rule of thumb he calls 60/80. It applies to runners of all ages (McGlynn is in his early 40s) but is particularly important to older masters runners bemoaning their inability to put in the high volumes they once did. What the 60/80 rule means, McGlynn says, is that even massive cutbacks in training don't slow you down as much as you might fear. ""I can do 60 percent in terms of volume and intensity and still be 80 percent as good,"" he says. Though to make this work, he says, you need to be careful not to jack up your speed work in an effort to compensate for reduced volume. ""A lot of people do 60 percent of the volume, then train so hard they have Achilles tendinitis and everything else,"" he says. Even if you've had a relatively smooth path through your masters career so far, this is another time when you may need to revise expectations for racing and training. Priorities for a Masters Runner Climbing the Age Ranks Whatever evolutionary biologist Lieberman says about our distant ancestors, this is an age where simply lining up for the start of a race is something most peers would never attempt. But if you're careful and dedicated, it's still possible to be good. One person who's discovered this is Mike Reif, coach of the Genesee Valley Harriers, an upstate New York club that has won dozens of masters championships. ""I've been running for over 55 years and [at age 65] got motivated because of the new age group,"" he says. He lost weight and began running with the athletes he coaches. He also remembered his youth, when he was on a national championship team. ""My mindset went back to that,"" he says. ""If you can make that transition, you can get motivated at any age."" Also useful is to find a club, even if many of the runners aren't your age. You can mentor some of the young ones. Others are inspirational, letting you point to a young speedster and say, ""Hey, he's part of my team."" Reif's club competes in USA Track & Field meets, where masters events can have sizeable fields, even in the higher age groups. But in road races, Joe Kregal, a 70-year-old from Portland, Oregon, says he is far too often the only one in his age group. That, he says, makes the victory feel hollow, even though he can still run a highly respectable 22:48 5K. ""So,"" he says, ""I compete with whoever's moving. If there are 1,000 people in the race and I come in in the top 20 percent, that's my race."" From a training perspective, caution now rules. Kregal is a fan of monitoring his body's twinges and reacts accordingly. And he believes in active recovery, like swimming and biking. It's also increasingly important to pay attention to strength training. The average person steadily loses muscle mass after age 30—this can represent a 30 to 40 percent decline by age 70. Just because you run, don't believe you're immune to this. And whatever you do, don't listen to the naysayers. ""Unless there's something anatomically wrong with you, you can get some pretty good speed going,"" Kregal says. ""The problem is that society wants to close you down. Don't quit when people tell you to."" Priorities for a Senior Masters Runner Kregal's advice to 70-year-olds applies double to the age divisions above him. For about two decades, beginning in the late 1980s, John Keston (now 90) was the dominant runner among his peers, setting age-group records in a wide range of distances. In his 70s he trained fairly traditionally, but as he approached 80, he found that rest had become so important he shifted to a three-day workout rotation, running one day (up to 16 miles), then walking 6 miles on each of the next two days. ""I also raced a lot, using the races as my speed work,"" he says. Only running every third day was a radical change from his prior training formula. But, he notes, ""It worked."" It worked so well, in fact, that at 80 he set world's bests for at least three distances: the mile, the 3,000m and the half marathon. Others find, though, that as the years mount, the onetime nuances of form, pacing, race strategy and training take a backseat to simply lining up for the next race start. Marv Metzer, an 87-year-old from McCook, Nebraska, still manages a 3:26 half marathon. Not fast, but it's the equivalent of a 30-year-old's 1:43. At his age, he says, training becomes more and more like work, and it's increasingly difficult to stay in shape. You also have to get used to the fact that you're slower than you'd like to be. On a recent training run, he says, he noticed his shadow and ""it looked like I was walking."" He's also had to reduce his racing (because otherwise he'd spend all of his time recovering) and cut his training drastically. ""I'm only doing about 15 miles a week,"" he says. ""A few years ago, I did 60."" But he plans to keep going, even if eventually he winds up walking. ""Unless something happens,"" he says, ""I'm still going to be out there moving."" Reif echoes the same sentiment. ""Use it or lose it,"" he says. ""Its very important to stay active and healthy. I am very motivated to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of my life."" And from a much younger masters perspective, Cotner notes that with each new age group, everything readjusts. ""But that's what masters running is,"" he says. ""You're reinventing yourself every season. We wipe the slate and start over.""

"The 5 Best Leggings With Phone Pockets, According to Our Testing","Some of them stay up better than others, but all are comfortable. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? What’s better than a pair of comfortable, supportive, wicking running tights? Comfortable, supportive, wickingrunning tightswith secure phone pockets built right in. At this point, almost all of myleggingshave pockets built in. I run with my phone in one of the deep side pockets, stash a few gels in waistband mesh pockets, and tuck a credit card into zipper back pockets. This eliminates the need for apack, and means I don’t have to load up my jacket pockets (which can feel bouncier than legging pockets). There are plenty of leggings with pockets, but not all of them are secure and comfortable for running. Loading the waistband and side pockets without the tights sliding down requires a high, wide, secure waistband that stays in place even with bouncing and a phone in the side. That means some of my top picks have a higher percentage of elastane for better shape retention and security, which also adds nice compression for muscle support. Your legging pockets should be deep and secure, and I look for a variety in addition to the phone pocket, including deep side compartments on the outside of the thighs, and ideally a zipper pocket along the back of the waistband if I want to bring cash or a card. Read on for my recommendations and reviews, born out of my testing. Want more? See our articles onThe Best Sports Bras with Pockets,The Best Hydration Packs,andThe Best Workout Leggings. Material blends play a key role in performance apparel. I look for moisture-wicking synthetics (usually polyester or nylon), which pull sweat away from my skin and aid in breathability. For warm-weather runs, mesh paneling or body-mapped perforations can be nice, and I prioritize four-way stretch to maximize range of motion as well as shape retention. Most tights have a percentage of elastane or spandex (10-35 percent) to provide durability, stretch, and light compression. Like I mentioned above, if you want to load the pockets, consider a higher percentage of elastane that will help prevent the tights from stretching and sagging. The best running tights have a snug, supportive fit that enhances comfort (and performance) by reducing friction and providing light-to-moderate compression. A good fit should feel secure but not restrictive, allowing for full range of motion without bunching or pinching. I like a high, wide waistband to help keep the tights in place without rolling or sliding, and I always aim to try on the leggings to ensure they conform well to my body. If you’re planning to load up the pockets, look for a drawcord in the waistband to help minimize sliding. Most name-brand running tights are fairly pricey, so you want them to last. All of the tights I recommend here are made with high-quality nylon or polyester, along with that 10-35 percent elastane (Spandex) for added stretch and strength. I look for tights with reinforced seams and tightly woven, abrasion-resistant fabrics, especially if I plan to take them out on the trail where they could get scuffed on plants and rocks. And the moisture-wicking properties aren’t just for comfort—they help maintain the fabric integrity by reducing wear from sweat. We focused on leggings with phone pockets here. But within that category, I recommend looking for pocket features that fit your specific needs, like zippered options if you often run with credit cards or your car key, or a small key clasp for security. All of the pockets on these tights are oriented for easy access, as well as tight and secure for keeping your items close to your body without bouncing out. Drawcords can help leggings stay up over your hips even with items in the pockets, and reflective detailing can keep you safe on pre-dawn or after-dark runs. Except for my budget pickBaleafs, all tights on this list are around $100, which is a lot of money for running apparel. That said, these should last multiple seasons, even with heavy use. You’re paying for high-quality, technical materials like moisture-wicking fabrics, compression technology, and durability that make them a worthwhile investment for avid runners—or people who would rather wear athletic clothes at all times. Cheaper options can work, just make sure they’re highly rated by real people. And be aware the cheap options might not last as long or provide the same amount of performance and durability. If you’re really cringing at the prices, I recommend looking for last season’s colors or models. These are often almost identical to in-line models, albeit in different colors or with minor design tweaks, and can often be had for a good discount as the seasons change. For this story, I tested many leggings with phone pockets, which is all I wear anyway. I wore them during road runs, gym workouts, trail runs, and longer run-hikes in the mountains around my town in southwest Montana. I made sure the phone pockets A) were secure, B) had accessible placement (so I could switch the song when something depressing came on), and C) didn’t feel like they interfered with the running tights themselves. Importantly, I also gauged these picks against my standard leggings, which means their high waistbands didn’t slide down, light compression provided fit and structure, and wicking materials kept sweat and odor at bay. The best leggings with the most secure, convenient phone pockets made this list. My phone addiction and inability to run without music finally came in handy. I’ve long been a fan of Janji’s shorts and tights, so I was excited to try these Trail Tights after several years wearing the brand’s Groundwork Tights. Like its other compression-style pants, these have a moderate squeeze thanks to the higher percentage of elastane (32 percent) than similar models. This makes for a somewhat stiffer pair of leggings, but they’re also more abrasion-resistant, and I’ve noticed no pilling whatsoever. Those olderGroundwork tightsalso stood out to me for their pockets, and the Trail Tights use the same material, but with more robust features. These have the same deep side pockets as the Groundwork, plus mesh pockets along the waistband and a back pocket where you can stash gels, bars, or use it as a “pass-through” for lightweight layers. I typically don’t do this—if I’m planning to shed layers I usually have arunning pack, and I don’t want mywind jacketflapping around my legs—but I’ve seen plenty of ultrarunners use this feature and it doesn’t seem to bother them. The pockets on these tights are incredibly secure. Each side pocket down the outside of the legs is more than 6 inches deep with a taper at the bottom that makes wedging a phone feel less risky. I’ve run in these tights with my phone, a headphone case, two bars, and twogelsand not had anything wiggle out of place. The higher level of compression also helps them stay put with more items in the pockets. The high and wide waistband is a non-negotiable as well, though the somewhat stiffer material here means I often have to pull the drawcord pretty tight to get the waistband to fully secure. The pockets are easy to reach into while running, though I’ve had some trouble getting under the mesh on the back waistband. Janji is a dedicated running company, so these tights are also odor-resistant and dry quickly if you sweat through the material. I wore my Groundwork Tights (same material, remember?) every day on a 230-mile backpacking trip and was comfortable the whole time. Overall, these hit top marks as versatile, convenient, abrasion-resistant tights with five generous and secure pockets. If the Janji tights are a little stiffer than others, these affordable Baleaf leggings are the opposite. When I first received these they looked so tiny I thought they were made for a doll. But the stretch is incredible, and they fit perfectly without feeling saggy or stretched out. These are a much simpler pair than the more expensive name brands, with welded, flat seams and flat-lock pockets without extra stitching but no cuff reinforcement. This helps keep the cost low without losing functionality, and I love how streamlined they look. Our main goal here is to find the most convenient, secure phone pockets in leggings, and with extended side pockets, these fit the bill. I wear them running and working out, but they are also so understated that I feel fine wearing them around town without looking like I just came from the gym. I tuck my phone and cards into the deep side pockets and haven’t ever worried about losing them. The phone pockets have a minimal silicon band at the top that can prevent a phone from sliding out, but the leggings are so form-fitting and the pockets so deep that I’ve never been concerned.  The side pockets are a similar depth as the Janji pockets, and my phone can sit all the way inside without poking out. As far as wicking goes, these are not going to be at the same level of material as the $100 options from name brands, but I’ve barely noticed a difference in odor-resistance and moisture-management. Granted, it’s usually colder when I’m wearing tights, but even on high-output workouts, these pull sweat from my body and dry quickly afterwards. The waistband actually stays in place better than other leggings I’ve tested, but it can roll (without sliding down, somehow) depending on how long you’re moving for. Overall these are my recommendation for affordable, brand-name-adjacent leggings that hold a phone securely, stay in place while running and working out, and are comfortable for all-day wear. Oiselle makes one of my favoritepocket bras, so it wasn’t much of a surprise that they nailed these leggings as well, with a whopping seven pockets that all securely hold small items and are easy to access on the go. The Pocket Jogger has a much lighter feel than most other pocket-packed running tights, with a brushed material and less elastane (just 10 percent) than others on this list. This makes them comfortable for all-day wear, but they do stay in place well thanks to the generously high-waisted cut, internal drawstring, and reinforced stitching. Part of what helps these stay so secure and form-fitting (despite the lower elastane) is that Oiselle gear is made entirely for women, designed by women. While I appreciate women’s apparel from other brands, I’ve found that women-specific companies often have better tailoring and fit for the female body, which allows more versatility in materials and features. So if another brand relies on heavier material to keep the pants up, a brand like Oiselle has such a female-specific design that the tights will stay in place when another pair might fall down. The pockets are ample, to say the least. Two wide side pockets run down the side of the legs, perfect for dropping a phone into. They also have similar mesh pockets along the waistband as the Janji Trail Tights, with elasticized top bands that snap into place. I put a few energy gels in here, and I’ve also stashed a small headphone case without having it bounce out. The zippered back pocket is wider than others I’ve tested—where I’d normally be fighting to wedge a phone or flat-fold wallet in, the low-profile zipper is nearly 6 inches long and easy to tuck small items into the waistband. The waistband itself has a good amount of reinforcement but manages to avoid pinch points or rolling despite the extra material. IN addition to the3⁄4-length here (23-inch inseam), these tights come in afull-length(27-inch inseam) version. I’ve also worn the brand’sPocket Jogger Shorts,which have a wide zippered back pocket, two mesh waistband pockets, and two side pockets. Hands down, these are the softest, most comfortable leggings I have ever worn. Built lighter and with less compression than the running-specific tights on this list, Free Fly’s leggings feel like nothing on your skin, with a brushed matte finish that has none of the slipperiness of more athletic leggings but retains the high-rise fit and flattering cut. These have a surprising amount of elastane (20 percent) for how light they feel, which helps retain shape and structure. But the soft-knit design keeps them light. These are quite breathable as well, though I’d steer clear of wearing them on trails or where they might get abraded. They can snag and catch more easily than the tougher, tighter weaves of more rugged tights, and I’ve noticed pilling between the legs from friction while walking. I had a pair of these right when they debuted, and I was thrilled to see the pocket-tights update this season. This version comes with three pockets—two drop-ins on the sides with tapered bases that help keep my phone secure, plus a small drop-in pocket on the waistband. This waistband pocket isn’t as secure as the ones on other pocket tights, so I keep a gel or lip balm in here but would probably avoid stashing cash or a key. Since these tights are lighter with a less compressive fit than others here, I’ve found them to be best for casual, comfortable wear, and less ideal for running—carrying a phone in the pocket can cause them to slide down, though the double-layer waistband prevents this while walking. These are also my top pick for travel, as they pack down to almost nothing, are incredibly comfortable for long flights, plus convenient when I don’t want to carry a purse or bag. One of the newer offerings from Brooks, the Spark Tight borrows a similar 10-inch rise and reinforced waistband as the brand’s popularMethod Tights, albeit with an updated material blend that enhances the breathable properties and wicking capabilities of high-output apparel. The Spark uses Brooks’s new “Go2 Secure” material, which has almost an interlocking weave that feels incredibly form-fitting and moves with me, allowing for a full range of motion and a variety of activities. The pockets on these tights are built right into the legs instead of separate mesh, with just two stitched seams along the side and a generous drop-in top. These also have the tapered bottom for extra security, allowing me to throw small items in without having them wiggle up on bouncy runs. The third pocket is a small waistband drop-in pocket. It’s larger than the drop-in waistband pocket on the Free Fly tights, and I can actually fit my iPhone in there, though I feel more comfortable with the phone in the leg drop-in pockets. The pocket placement on the legs is similar to the other pairs I’ve listed, directly on the outside of both thighs and easy to reach in and grab my phone or stash items while running. These don’t stay up quite as well as the Oiselle tights, and I find myself hiking them up every so often during runs. That said, I haven’t noticed a difference with a phone in the pocket (compared to not) affecting how much the tights slide down. While all tights on this list are breathable, I’ve found the Spark Tight to feel the smoothest and driest next-to-skin, which is somewhat surprising considering they have over 20 percent elastane. This is partially due to the almost plush-feeling weave structure, which allows tiny gaps of air between the fibers to help move moisture away from the body.

A Day in the Life of One of the Nation’s Fastest Milers,"We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? ""They don't hand out medals based on what time you run. We want to win."" Here's a movie pitch for you: A late-blooming high school state champion goes to college, gets arrested, flunks out, labors as a landscaper, gets a second chance, earns his degree, and becomes one of the country's elite milers. Interested? Great. There's only one catch:Eric Avila's storyis still unfinished. ""I think I’m a national caliber runner. I can 'fill the field,' I guess,"" Avila, 29, told us from his home as his cat, Simba, looked on, half awake. ""Now we want to be on the start line to win."" ""We"" refers to Avila's coach, Terrence Mahon, and recently new teammates at The Mission Athletics Club, an elite team sponsored by adidas and based in San Diego, just a (traffic-contingent) stone's throw from Avila's childhood and current home in Chula Vista. With his father retired, his brother settling down, and himself searching for balance, the decision to move back was an easy one. Now settled into a routine, Avila tookRunner's Worldthrough a day in his training life. (Ed. Note: This conversation has been edited for length and clarity) I wake up at 7:30 or 8, depending when we’re meeting. It fluctuates because of traffic. I make my Aeropress coffee and have my breakfast. Yogurt, cocoa powder, cocoa nibs, and chia seeds that I put in the fridge overnight. In the morning I throw in some frozen fruit, peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon powder. If I’m really hungry I’ll also make some toast and marmalade just because I’m a sucker for toast and marmalade. Right after that I have my coffee, take some vitamins, maybe some supplements. On a workout day, just a protein shake. Sometimes I take my roommate's dog out and hang with him. Sometimes I hang with the cat. Usually I have my headphones on, listening to a podcast or reading a book. That's kinda my thing, like, don't talk to me. I grab a water bottle, pack my backpack, head out. I live the farthest away so I’m the one who has to leave an hour-plus before. I'm constantly checking traffic, updating, seeing where I'm at. On workout days I drink my pre-workout drink on the drive. I try get to practice on time. We chit-chat a bit about news, politics, a lot of banter. It’s like a family, it makes it fun. Makes it a lot less like work than it has to be. Then we do our run. Monday and Thursday is an easy run then drills and hill sprints or dynamic stability work. Wednesday is our mid-week long run; 10 or 12 miles in the morning and call it a day. Tuesday and Friday are big days—a long track session or tempo then regroup at Kinetic Performance gym to lift for an hour or two. Saturday is easy. Sunday is long; 14 to 18 miles, depending where we are in training. Terrence is really good about approaching it from a scientific standpoint but some days you’re just mentally drained. That’s where the team comes into effect. My training partners, these Olympians and amazing athletes, have days when they don’t have anything. It's nice in a way to see that they’re human. All these commercials are like, ""Push through the pain! No off days!"" We have a different mindset, a holistic approach. We value recovery. If you’re tired, there’s a reason. If you don’t have it today, go home. I take care of errands, you know, life stuff, and commute home. Costco is down the street and they have really good acai bowls for like five bucks. If I'm really hungry I'll grab an acai bowl and a slice of pizza. I do that pretty regularly actually. Otherwise I make lunch right when I get home. Eggs and tuna, just a bunch of protein, and spinach. Put the tuna in a skillet, crack the eggs over it, stir it up in the pan, put some Cholula or Sriracha on there—dude, amazing. I mean, I think it’s awesome. My parents live down the road, my dad’s retired and doesn’t have much going on so I sometimes go over and do work and hang out with him. He's funny. He gets excited about little things and that makes me happy. That brings balance to my day. On big session days, we finish around 2:30. I'll grab a chicken wrap or shawarma from the smoothie joint by the gym. There’s also a taco shop with amazing California burritos. At that point I’m just looking for calories. I get home, shower, nap. I'm exhausted at that point. Four miles, maybe five. I double almost every day. My friends I grew up with, they have day jobs and they still kind of run so we’ll go jog. Last year once a week I ran with the local high school kids, which was a lot of fun. Their energy’s contagious. There’s a junior college in the area too so sometimes I run with them. Or I run from my house. The Chula Vista Olympic Training Center Trail is right outside my door. I’m definitely spoiled. I also have a guest room that's a revolving door of other athletes and teammates so that makes it easy to just step out the door and go. I go to Trader Joe’s or Sprouts and pick up salmon or whatever I’m cooking that night. There are some breweries along the trail too so sometimes I run and then my brother, who also lives down the road, and I will go grab a beer. Or I'll get Flame Broiler—it’s the healthiest to-go down the road. There’s a really good Thai place that makes amazing curry, so I go there like once a week. Sometimes there’s trivia night with my teammates so I go into town. Most nights I fire up the oven, chop up some sweet potatoes and broccoli. Pretty standard, boring. I have my routine down. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday nights I have some sort of stability/hip bridge/band exercises for glute activation. I call that my homework. I'm on lockdown, especially if I have a workout the next morning. Depending on the day I either read or play FIFA in my room. Go to bed. Fall asleep around 11-11:30.

The 28 Best Cheap Gifts for Runners Who Already Have Everything,"Essential stocking stuffers—or just surprise gifts—that don’t require coughing up much cash. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Buying that perfect present for the runner on your list is not easy, especially when you’re on a tight budget. Instead of adding yet another expensive piece of gear to their collection, make your favorite runner feel special this holiday season with an inexpensive gift they’ll actually love and use for years to come. And just because they don’t cost a fortune, doesn’t mean they aren’t high-quality—we’ve carefully curated a list of cheap gifts for runners, with each item priced under $50 (and most under $30) at the time of this writing. From running accessories to tiny tchotchkes, these products make great small gifts, stocking stuffers, or secret Santa presents—or you can combine a bunch for a fun gift basket. Not finding what you’re looking for? Check out our othergift guides for runners: Thesedeodorizersuse charcoal to absorb odors and moisture, which prevents bacteria from growing in your gear bag or shoes. Each pair keeps its funk-fighting power for up to one year. Lightweight and breathable, these hats are great for sunny races, or every day runs. They are super adjustable and come in nine different colors, and even packs of two or more. Using the included straps, they can attach these lights almost anywhere—to a wrist, ankle, or bike frame—for increased visibility. A subscription box is a solid option for those runners who are always in the market for new running gear and goodies. Not only does the box have snacks to refuel, but also more practical items like backpacks and running hats to make each mile easier. Additionally, subscribers can participate in the FunRunBoxers, an online community where users can access training tips and look to other members for support and motivation. It doesn’t look like much, but this minimalistbelthas space to carry some money, your phone,gels, and keys. It works on a wide variety of body sizes and comesrecommended by our editorsfor its simple but effective design. Think the runner in your life may need some extra inspiration? Get them theRunner’s Worldcalendar with its photos of scenic trails, training and nutrition tips, and even a pace guide for races. It’s even on sale now for 20 percent off. Part of Cotopaxi’s (Re)Purpose Collection, the Bataan is made from fabric scraps left over from the production of other packs and gear. So it cuts down on waste, and since the craftspeople doing the sewing are working with what’s available, no two packs are exactly alike. As for practicality, the three-liter capacity is enough to stash things like a wallet, a phone, and some fuel. There’s no such thing as too many water bottles, especially those that are super convenient and easy to take on runs. Made from BPA-free hydrofoam, this bottle boasts a minimalistic and low-profile design that effortlessly fits in the palm of the hand so runners can hold it as they are on the move—that’s right, no added weight and unwanted movement here. For those giftees with long hair, opt for a pack of scrunchies to keep it out of their face while on the go. These hair ties are lightweight and can seamlessly wrap your hair in a bun or ponytail in seconds without causing any unwanted damage or breakage. When it comes time to clean, they can simply be tossed in the washing machine and dryer for use on a future run. Most runners probably have a pair of sneakers they love by this point, but you can’t have too many socks (especially when the dryer continuously eats them). These no-show socks provide arch support and mesh zones for comfort around the rest of the foot while in motion and at rest. Find them in a plethora of colors in sizes S to XL. For those morning runners, they can fuel up with this popcorn pancake and waffle mix. Made from non-GMO popped popcorn flour, organic oat flour, organic wheat, almond meal, and poppy seeds, this mix boasts a whopping 11 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per serving. Your giftee can cut up some fruit and make it a full balanced meal that’s both delicious and nutritious. These gloves are perfect for chilly fall runs, and are lightweight enough to throw in your pocket if you get too hot. Plus, they have touchscreen pads on the thumb and index finger which allow you to use your phone without removing the gloves. Believe it or not, lips are one of the most susceptible areas to skin damage and cancer. The skin is delicate and they usually get passed over when applying sunscreen to the rest of the body. This lip balm offers great sun protection, and has a hydrating formula perfect for long, sunny runs. While not as cozy as a puffer vest, this reflective option can help keep your giftee safe. It has an adjustable waist that fits most men and women and has reflective features on back and front. It also is made of mesh, so it can be worn as a top layer in all seasons. As phones get bigger and bigger, it gets harder to find an armband that doesn’t slip under the weight. Even though this Tribe can fit an iPhone X, its neoprene, Lycra, and polyurethane construction will help it stay in place. Give the gift of sun protection to those runners who like to venture outside to rack in those miles. These polarized sunglasses block harmful UVA and UVB rays while maintaining color accuracy and precision. The best part? They have an anti-skid nose pad and silicone temple to make sure they stay in place so your giftee won’t have to worry about them falling off mid-run. This is the perfect gift for the newlyweds who are used to having their rings on, but don’t want to chance it with their wedding bands. The stylish silicone ring features patented grooves, which allow air to flow in and moisture to flow out—ideal for when you’re on an outdoor adventure. It’s available in 13 different colors including black, coral, and lilac and in sizes 4 to 12. Running outside is preferred by many, but it’s important to protect the face and skin from the sun. Made with a breathable sleek design, this cap not only blocks the sun, but leaves room to put a ponytail through without leaving a bump. Additionally, the adjustable closure makes it easy to find the perfect fit whether one has a larger or smaller head. Running a marathon is no easy feat for both the mind and body. For physical pain relief, this soothing epsom salt combines oat milk protein and argan oil to help relax muscles and relieve swelling to minimize pain. Unlike other foam rollers and massage sticks, this gift is less than $6 and will last your giftee a long time. For the runner with a sense of humor, opt for this “It’s not swagger, I’m just sore” shirt. These unisex tees are made from a cotton and polyester blend and are perfect for those runs where one might need a bit more coverage than a sports bra. It’s available in sizes XS to 4X and in a variety of colors including blue, green, red, and gray.

These Running-Related Holiday Cards Will Put a Skip in Your Step,"For those who know that running is the merriest activity of all… We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? We love holiday cards featuring cute kids and ugly sweaters as much as the next living, breathing human being, but who says family-focused cards are your only option? Whether you’re single, Scroogey, or simply haven’t gotten around to taking festive family photos this year, these running-related holiday cards are an ideal alternative. Who knows? Maybe you’ll even inspire someone to head out of a run. Order your favorite cards fast so they arrive in time for the holidays. In case you forgot the children’s story, the gingerbread man ran away from his baker yelling: “Run, run, as fast as you can. You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” Spoiler alert: A fox eats him, but these modern-day geared-up gingerbread men are trying not to relive his fate. Supine position + tons of food = you on Christmas, me after a marathon. Enough said. Are there any better well wishes for a fellow runner? We suggest this one for your always-injured friend or go-to running buddy. Dashing through the snow? It’s very possible “Jingle Bells” is a winter running anthem in disguise. (Related:27 Holiday Songs That Will Keep You Running All Season Long.) Let this graphic serve as a subtle reminder of all the sneakers on your wish-list. (Triathletes should also check outthis adorable cycling-focused cardfrom the same Etsy store.) Okay, this one isn’tdirectlyrelated to running, but we could all use some chill vibes and a reminder to stretch. Namaste. [Stay injury free on the road by getting on the mat withYoga for Runners.] This collage format lets you upload photos that represent your year in review: the Boston marathon, the Chicago marathon, the New York marathon. Or, you know, mix it up with some family/cat/travel pics, too. Even non-runners will appreciate a nod to the best food ever created: bread. (BTW,we have the easiest bread recipe of all time.) TBH, uploading a super earnest marathon pic of yourself isalittlemuch, but we won’t fault you for sending a fun group shot to your training crew or cheer squad. Because snowball sprints beat treadmill intervals by about a billion points.

If you’re out of time to deliberate, these gifts are a slam dunk—plus, we’ve included options across a wide price range, so you can find everything from extravagant gifts to stocking stuffers. When the temperature drops, they’ll want a good pair of gloves that still allows them to text their running buddy or switch to a different song. With silicone palm grips and a terry cloth brow wipe on the back, these from TrailHeads keep hands warm but dry during winter runs, even in single-digit temperatures. If you want to give the gift of relaxation (plus faster recovery times and less pain after runs), this mini handheld massage gun will help them experience just that. Whether they develop tension in their neck, back, or legs, this device uses percussive movements to penetrate deep into tissue to improve circulation and reduce aches. This massage gun even comes with an app that they can use to make the most of their time using it. While not everyone may enjoy getting socks as a gift, runners will certainly appreciate these comfortable, blister-preventing Balega socks. And really, they can never have too manyquality socks. It’s difficult to go wrong gifting a runner with a pair of sneakers, especially if they’re these from Brooks. These lightweight sneakers will keep feet swiftly moving and are available in multiple colors to suit a variety of styles. Give them an excuse to celebrate all of their accomplishments by displaying their trophies on thismedal rack. It includes 12 vinyl protector sheets for race bibs, photos, or other papers, and holds up to 24 medals. Figuring out how to carry your water, keys, and phone on a run is a classic problem, but FlipBelt solves it. This unassuming tube of fabric is comfortable and fits snugly to hold any gear without it bouncing off the legs or torso. We recommend thisrunning beltfor the best fit, since it can suit a variety of sizes and doesn’t have any uncomfortable buckles or seams. These high rise compression leggings made from 79 percent recycled plastic bottles and 21 percent spandex will keep runners feeling warm and secure as they make their way through their run. And, they’re equipped with pockets that can hold keys or some loose change while on the move. If you’re shopping for someone who enjoys running in the rain, this waterproof jacket may be just what they need to stay dry while on route. Since its shell is made completely of waterproof Nylon, any water that hits the surface will be quickly repelled. Although this is a rain jacket, it is lightweight and doesn’t drag one down when wearing. We recommend Columbia’srain jackets for running in the rainbecause of their comfortable fit and decent price point, but you might want to opt for thePourationmodel if you need air vents. This running journal from Gone For a Run offers organized templates for keeping detailed mileage and stat records. Your friend might even flip through to look back fondly on their old training log when they PR on their next race. It’s almost inevitable that people sweat when they run, but getting sweat in your eyes stings and can make you lose your cadence. This polyester-spandexsweatbandis comfortable and wicks away sweat so that the wearer can spend more time focusing on their best mile and less time wiping sweat from their face.

Thesenon-polarized sunglasseshave plastic lenses that directly cover the eyes thanks to its no slip grip nose pad. This pair also contains a UV protection coating for extra protection. Foot massagers are wonderful tools for releasing tension in the feet and expediting the recovery process. This electric one in particular is great as users can customize their massage experience. Its foot sleeves can also  be removed and washed as needed. After a run, they’ll want a pair of shoes that’ll keep their feet feeling good. Theserecovery slide sandalscan help as they absorb 37 percent more impact than many other shoes. I’ve been wearing these sandals for months and these are my go-to shoes of choice for comfort after working out. Essential oil diffusers are a great gift for just about everyone. Aromatherapy can help with everything from boosting their mood, to relaxation, and the extra humidity it adds to the air is great for dry winters. It’s always better to be prepared than not when on a run, and Fitly understood that when it created this runninghydration vest. Since this vest is equipped with a phone holder, an integrated flask, and several storage pockets, it’s unlikely they’ll leave their home and not have everything they need (as long as they remember to pack everything beforehand). What’s better than having one sports bra? Having five. When it comes to running, having access to quality sports bras can be helpful to keep your chest compressed and contained as you bounce with each stride. Whether they’d prefer neutral or more vibrant colors, there are packs of five available—a great gift for someone who just recently started running.

The Best Hiking Apps for Trail Runners,"We asked seasoned trail runners which apps they turn to when they want to clock miles through the woods. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? One of the best things about running is that you don’t really need many tools or gadgets to get out there and do it.Trail running, in particular, often comes with the beauty of disconnecting from the world and enjoying nature’s views around you. So it might seem a little ironic that smart phone apps are often key tools for planning and executing an epic trail run. But they certainly come in handy when it’s time tomap out your route. Apps meant for planning outhikingtreks andmountain biking adventurescan help you find the best trails to find your stride. And they’ll tell you everything from elevation gain to current trail conditions. Some even let you download maps to use for navigation offline when you’re in a cell service dead zone. To help you figure out the best apps to download for trail running, we asked seasoned trail runners to tell us what they use to plan their trips. Here, the top five picks. AllTrailsseems to be the most popular pick among trail runners for a few reasons. “This app satisfies my basic planning needs for ashort runor day-long adventure,” says Olympian and HOKA-sponsored ultra-marathon runnerMagda Boulet. This is especially important forZach Miller, ultrarunner for the North Face, who lives and trains out of his bus. “I move around a lot and am often in areas that I am not very familiar with,” he says. “It’s funny how you can be in the middle of a trail running paradise but feel like you don’t know where/how to access all that is there. The AllTrails app is really helpful for seeing what is around.” One of the most useful features of the app is the difficulty ratings for each trail—but you have to keep in mind that those rating may not be totally accurate for you. “They’re often put in by locals who are used to the trails,” saysMirna Valerio, an ultrarunner sponsored by Merrell and author ofA Beautiful Work in Progress.  “‘Moderate for a local can be extremely difficult for someone who hasn't trail run there before. So it’s helpful—but take it with a grain of salt,” she says. Other stand-out features of AllTrails include: Price:Basic membership: free; pro membership: $30/yearAvailable on:iOS and Android Primarily meant for finding mountain bike trails,MTB Projectcan be helpful when you’re trail running in a place that primarily has mixed-use trails, Valerio says. “Sometimes it has trails on it that AllTrails doesn’t,” she says. It doesn’t always load properly, she notes, so make sure you have your trail picked out and map downloaded before you get into poor-cell-service territory. Stand-out features include: Price:FreeAvailable on:iOS and Android TheonX Huntis the app Valerio turns to when there’s a lot of unmarked trails in the area. It shows an extensive trail network, and makes it clear who owns the land—whether it’s federal, state, or private. “You don't want to be trespassing on someone’s property when it’s an unmarked trail,” Valerio says. Since the app shows you who owns the property, you could potentially contact them and ask if you could use their trails. Join Runner's World+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners Stand-out features include: Price:Premium (includes 1 state): $30/year; Elite (all 50 states): $100/yearAvailable on:iOS and Android “TheGaia GPSapp offers a wonderful feature of downloading maps, makes it easy to record data, and share trips with family and friends,” Boulet says. “It is my safety partner that helps me navigate the backcountry.” She describes Gaia as her go-to app when she feels more adventurous and needs help navigating the less traveled backcountry trails over multiple days. Craig Randall, a trail runner who works with theFastest Known Time(FKT), says that runners in the FKT community rely on this app big time for both planning andtrackingpurposes. Stand-out features include: Price:Basic Membership: free; premium membership: $40/yearAvailable on:iOS and Android Randall says thatCalTOPOis another app that the FTK community uses often. He describes the mapping information as “incredibly comprehensive.” “CalTopo is incredibly sophisticated and can show slope angle shading, current snow pack, a water gauge to show where you can fill up and filter water, and wildfire activity,” Randall says. Manypeople chasing fastest known timesdon't follow traditional trails and paths, Randall adds, and CalTOPO is an invaluable tool for planning routes and gathering important data (namely, those snow pack and wildfire forecasting stats) to traverse safely.

The 8 Best Headlamps for Runners,"Our favorite recent design trend? Lamps that work with both rechargeable and AAA batteries. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Whether you’re a predawn runner or are missing out on daylight duringpost-work sessions, running outside can be a logistical challenge. But when equipped with a quality headlamp (andreflective apparel, of course), logging miles in the dark can be a blast. See quick info below on some of the bestlightsfrom our testing, then scroll deeper for longer reviews of these and other top-performing models, plus buying advice. Running on an open road under a full moon is a completely different experience than running singletrack trails beneath heavy tree cover—and both require different lighting. In general, look for a headlamp that’s capable of cranking out at least 200 lumens on its high setting. Lumens is a measure of the light’s intensity—brightness. Lamps with higher lumens—300 and up—are better for trails and starless nights. If you want a single light that is capable of multiple situations, look for one with more than just low, medium, and high settings. Some lamps can automatically adapt to the ambient light around you—handy if, say, you peek at your watch and don’t want to be blinded by the reflection (the light dims a bit). Others allow you more manual adjustability. Longer battery life typically comes at a cost: weight. Naturally, batteries with more capacity have to be larger. For some activities, that’s no problem, but for running, extra weight and bulk can lead to annoying bounce. Some models cram the batteries into the lamp on your forehead, while others with exceptionally long burn times will separate the two components and place the power pack on the strap at the back of your head. If you want a budget light for laps around your neighborhood, the former will suffice. But if you’re gearing up for an ultramarathon that will have you up all night, go for the bigger battery. Who among us doesn’t have a drawer full of various USB charging cables? Well, there’s a good chance your next headlamp will come with one as well. But the downside to rechargeables is that you could find the battery dead as you’re headed out the door, when you don’t have an hour or two to spare waiting for it to power up. If that sounds like you, opt for a light that runs off AA or AAA batteries, and stock up. Some headlamps (see theSilva Trail Runner Free HandBlack Diamond Sprinter 500below) work with either AAA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack if you want that kind of versatility. You’ll save money by getting a light with a single lamp that puts out a consistent beam. But more advanced options include both a spotlight and a flood, allowing you to use each separately or combine the two for maximum brightness. You’ll find the spotlight is great for casting the light farther down the road or brightly illuminating the trail directly in front of you. A floodlight, on the other hand, diffuses the beam, spraying light to the sides as well to help with peripheral vision. Our team of editors and writers has tested and evaluated every headlamp on this list (and more). We research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and designers, and rely on our own experience on roads and trails long after the sun has set or before it comes up. Runner-in-Chief Jeff Dengate tests and evaluates headlamps in our darkened running shoe storage room. To gauge light intensity, we used a handheld luxmeter placed on the ground approximately two strides away. We tested the headlamps every 15 minutes to determine how long they shined at their maximum brightness. Some lamps dim by as much as two-thirds in the first five minutes. Others maintain full intensity until their batteries die. In addition to evaluating these headlamps for their adjustability and beam types, we test the lights’ brightness over time to determine how long each shines at full power. For theBlack Diamond Sprint 225andSprinter 500,Energizer Vision Ultra HD,Silva Trail Runner Free H, andPetzl Actik Core, we did this by turning each lamp on at its maximum setting and pointing it at a digital luxmeter on the ground roughly two strides away—about as far as you’d look ahead on technical trails. We measured the intensity at 15-minute intervals to see how quickly the light faded. Most models gradually dimmed over time, though a few fell off quickly—Black Diamond and BioLite say it’s an industry standard to drop intensity as your eyes adjust to the darkness so they can extend run time. For such lamps, the max lumens and battery life are a bit misleading, since you’ll never be able to keep the lamp at 100 percent for more than a few minutes. For this most recent update, we evaluated the current lineup of headlamps and made sure all were up to date and still available. We tested during extended night hiking and running (both pre-dawn and after sunset), taking into consideration the same criteria as we did in previous rounds, including light intensity over time (though we didn’t use the digital luxmeter this go), battery life on all settings, adjustability, recharging time if applicable, and beam strength. And we put an emphasis on comfort and stability during running and other high-impact activities. If the headlamp is headache-inducing or doesn’t stay put while running, it’s hard to recommend. Out of that crop, theBioLite HeadLamp 325,Nitecore NU25, andBlack Diamond Distance 1500earned their way into our rankings. We love this sleek, compact headlamp for running because of its performance and features, combined with its comfortable fit. The slim headband doesn’t look all that sturdy but does a great job of keeping the small light from bouncing, and the easy adjustability makes it dead simple to change brightness. Instead of clicking a small button to dim or brighten the lamp, simply swipe up or down past sensors on the side of the housing to change intensity—it even works with gloves and sweaty hands. A note about the “2 hours on high” battery claim: My testing found the Sprint 225 dims considerably during the first 5 minutes on high power—a far faster drop-off than most lamps on this page—and then settles into a medium intensity that Black Diamond says is intended as a “power-saving feature.” I found that medium intensity is plenty bright for both trail and road running, and it remained steady for the next 3 hours. But just know you won’t get a full 225 lumens for more than a few minutes at a time.—Jeff Dengate A surprisingly versatile headlamp at a dirt cheap price, Energizer’s Vision Ultra HD shocked me with how much light it puts out—a claimed 400 lumens. The spotlight was bright enough to illuminate the road a good distance in front of me, and switching it to flood mode cast a wide spread closer to my feet when I wanted to see where I was actually stepping. Plus, it has both red and green night vision LEDs. I’ve been using the red to read in bed at night, to be honest. Of course, a budget lamp sometimes has trade-offs. The charging cable for our sample had been crimped in the packaging or damaged before being sealed up, because the insulation around the wires was damaged. We were able to repair it ourselves rather quickly, and we haven’t had any issues since. Still, we’ll be keeping an eye on the continued durability of both headlamp and charging cord.—JD The Sprinter 500 is reminiscent of the Icon that we’ve recommended before and loved, but in a more runner-friendly package. It, too, uses the rear-mounted battery pack and over-the-head stabilizing strap, but the battery pack and lamp unit both are smaller and lighter so they won’t wiggle a bit when you’re bounding down a dark road. Like the earlier 275 model, the new Sprinter 500 still operates with a rechargeable battery pack or three AAA batteries. The major difference is—you guessed it—an additional 225 lumens. And, while its runtime isn’t all that impressive on a spec sheet, we’ve found you can dial back the intensity to get through any overnight ultra outing. If you need the high-beam and drain it, swapping to disposable batteries is quick and easy. A favorite feature of ours is the lamp’s memory feature, so the beam is the same brightness every time you turn it on. “I love the Sprinter 500 because it’s super lightweight, bright, small, and has versatile power options,” saidPat Heine,Runner’s World’s video producer and resident ultrarunner. “It spans the gap between budget options and the ‘bright-as-a-truck’s-headlights’ lamps. I use it for the majority of my night running.”—JD Following up on Silva’s tank-like ultrarunning headlamp, theTrail Speed 5XT, this lighter, slimmer model works on short trail and road runs. The battery pack is a slim hybrid unit mounted on the back of the headband and, rather than routing coiled cables through clips, the power passes through the headband itself. It’s a neat feature that makes the lamp even more comfortable in use. But, if you need to stash the battery pack inside a jacket for especially cold outings, a longer cloth-wrapped cable is included. The lamp offers only three brightness settings, and you can’t select different lights (beam/flood). But it has a combination that works well at running speeds—a floodlight hits the ground nearest you while a sharper beam is cast farther ahead. In our tests, it held its max brightness consistently for the first 2 hours, but fell off a cliff by the end of the third hour; its light was so dim you wouldn’t be able to find your way out of the woods on a moonless night. Another really cool feature is the ability to toggle a rear red light for road running. Inside the battery case, a switch can be set to off, on, or blink. The “H” in the name stands for “hybrid” battery. Aversion that runs on only three AAA batteriescosts a bit less, or you can getone with a larger battery packfor $140.—JD Like others here, this headlamp is versatile in that it can run off either three AAA batteries or a rechargeable “Core” battery pack that comes with the lamp—and you don’t need any special converters. But best of all: the micro USB charging port is built into the battery pack. In a pinch, you can leave it plugged in at home while you use the headlamp with AAA batteries. In use, it has three modes, with a floodlight and spot beam, plus a red lamp that lets you see in the dark without blinding yourself or your running partners. Plus, the band has 360-degree reflective accents and a whistle built into one of the adjustment buckles.—JD The 325 is one of the newer offerings from BioLite, replacing the 330 from a few seasons ago. Aside from faster charging and a longer battery life, the main upgrade I appreciate from this new model is the lack of extra battery pack on the back. I thought this might impact battery life, but the 325 actually lasted almost 40 minutes longer on high than the 330. That said, I didn’t find BioLite’s claim for 3 hours of high-powered output to be accurate, and even with a fresh charge, the 325 only lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes on high. Where it stands out is the integrated light casing. Instead of a more bulky light-and-control housing, this lays almost flat against the headband strap and barely protrudes at all. This both reduced bounce (which keeps the headlamp in place better) and eliminated potential pressure points.—Maggie Slepian This is one of our top picks for extended trips or overnight runs thanks to its winning combination of lumens, weight, and impressive battery life. Despite the decidedly more industrial look than the sleek big-box outdoor brands, this little powerhouse packs a punch in every category. For less than 2 ounces, it has multiple brightness modes, a strobe mode, and a red-light mode for walking around aid stations without making everyone else mad. In my experience, 360 lumens is more than enough for running at night. And the NU25 charges in less than 90 minutes from low battery to full. Nitecore says it lasts 160 hours on low (I haven’t tested this), but the brand also says that “low” is 1 lumen, which realistically none of us are really using unless we’re in dire straits. That said, you’ll get usable light (from 40 to 190 lumens) for 5 to 8 hours, which is impressive for such a small package. The red light is bright, and I was able to run and hike with the high output red light for several hours, which also eases eye strain and makes you less of a pain around other people.—MS For ultrarunners (or anyone tackling an extended run in the dark over technical terrain), the Black Diamond Distance 1500 is a bright, powerful headlamp with a magnetic battery pack that makes swapping batteries easy and reduces the stress of running out of power. I used this primarily on its 300-lumen setting, which can last up to 8 hours (I maxed out at 6 hours before finishing the trail section), and a simple tap on the side brings this to its full 1,500-lumen power for 10 seconds of “boost,” which helps you clarify any weird trail obstacles or animal eyes in the dark. It’s very reasonable to expect this to be serviceable for an entire overnight during an ultra, as long as you bring a spare battery pack to change out, which takes 30 seconds. The over-the-head strap system keeps this somewhat heavier model in place better than other 1,500-lumen options. And while it does bounce more than an ultralight model, it did stay in place well during my testing.—MS Jeff is Runner-in-Chief forRunner's World, guiding the brand's shoes and gear coverage.

"How to Plan a Safe Winter Trail Run, Plus Where to Go","Use these tips when you want to clock miles on snowy wooded paths. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Whether you’rerunningon snow-packed dirt roads, fluffy singletrack through wilderness, urban park trails, or groomed routes for snowmobilers orNordic skiers, winter trail runs offer a refreshing joy and challenge. “Trail runningin winter can be a different, exhilarating experience—and fun. A lot of times that can mean running at night and dealing with the conditions is part of the game no matter what the temperature is. If you know how to prepare and feel safe, you don’t have to feel limited bywinter weather,” says Amie Dworecki, head coach and CEO of Running with Life. Join Runner's World+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners Kari Gibbons, a two-time finisher and the 2021 women’s foot champion of the 350-mileIditarod Trail Invitational, agrees and adds, “I’ve always loved that feeling of being warm outside on arun when it’s cold. Themental sideis the hardest part. But working through winter trailrun challengescan make you stronger in yoursummer runs.” Here, tips on how to safely plan a winter trail run according to experienced winter athletes, coaches, and race directors. Plus, a few trails across the U.S. worth checking out. Snowy landscapes are serene but can be disorienting, especially if you’re not well-versed with the surrounding landmarks. “Get really familiar with a shorter trail before you branch out on longer trails. Everything is white and looks different in winter,” says Dworecki, who is also an RRCA-certified run coach, based in Indiana. In addition to navigation, yourbody also needs to adjust to the new terrain. “Winter trail running surfaces can be more strenuous, because you’re using morecore stabilizationand balance,” says Dworecki. She recommends cutting your distance in half at first to see how your body responds. You don’t want to be sidelined due tofatigueor move super slow in cold weather—which can leadhypothermiaor frostbite—if you try to tackle mileage that ends up being too rigorous. Forwinter runs, Gibbons has a one-hour rule. “If the run is longer than one hour, you don’t want to soak your layers in sweat. If you’re wet, you’ll be in trouble,” says Gibbons. Too few or too manylayersand over-sweating can lead to hypothermia, adds arctic ultrarunner Martin Like, the creator and race director of the6633 Arctic Ultrain the Canadian Yukon territory. The key: micro-adjustments to yourlayeringsystem. “Heat regulation and venting will allow you torun longerand be safer, because you’re not drenched. All my layers on top have zippers and hoods. If I’mtrail runningand see a hill, I unzip a couple of layers or take my hat off (I wear two light hats instead of one thick one). At the top of hill, it’s blustery, and I zip back up,” says Gibbons. Like agrees, “You don’t want to think, ‘I’m getting warm and I’ll just get to top of hill.’ Then you’ve done too much sweating, and it’s too late. Deal with the heat management scenario there and then. Don’t put it off.” Against the skin, wear a thin sweat-wicking, quick-drying base layer, says Like, such as theTracksmith Brighton Base Layer. Like does not recommend wearing a waterproof jacket as an outerlayer, “because they do not rid moisture quick enough.” Instead, look for an active insulation outerlayer that helps to regulate body temperature while dumping body heat, like theDaehlie Jacket Winter Run 2.0or theArc’teryx Atom LT Hoody. Dworecki adds that you should wearglovesor mittens, ahat, and bring a waterproof or warm outerlayer in apack, just in case you need to stop. “If you’re lost or standing around navigating, you don’t want to get cold,” she says. Also, exposed skin—such as on your fingers, ears, or nose—can lead to frostbite, so make sure you have everything covered if thetemperatures are freezingand consider windchill, too. “Frostbite can sneak up and is a risk if you need to stop on the trail. If your exposed skin starts to turn red or white or is turning numb, be aware of that sign,” says Dworecki. “If your running partner’s speech is slurred or they’re shivering uncontrollably, get out the foil blanket, use your cell phone, and get inside as soon as possible,” she adds. If the conditions are icy,run slowerthan usual, and considertraction devices. “You can wear crampons or microspikes, which are like tire chains for your feet. They make workouts better, because you have grip and aren’t sliding around. You don’t want to fall or twist your ankle,” says Dworecki. (Ice can existunderthe snow, too.) To verify the fit, pull on yourtraction devicesfor a short run near your house before heading to a route further away or one that’s remote. Also, be sure to wear the correcttrail running shoefor the area’s winter conditions—be it mud, ice, or snow—so the grip is adequate, adds Dworecki. Beware: “The same roots and rocks that exist in the summer exist in the winter under the smooth snow. Though it can be strenuous, be sure to pick up your feet as you run,” says Dworecki. If the trail is ungroomed and has fresh, deep snow, Gibbons packs running poles andDion lightweight race snowshoes. From Antarctica to New Mexico’s 43-mile Mt Taylor Winter Quadrathlon, Dworecki  has raced in extreme conditions including ice-coated terrain and -25 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures, so she knows what it’s like totrail runin remote wilderness areas with tricky conditions. She says to consider picking up a compactrun-specific first aid kit, then add supplies based on the terrain and winter conditions in which you’ll be clocking miles. “Put in anemergency blanketto keep yourself warm if anything happens. If you’re in an area that deals with wildlife, carry bear spray or pepper spray. Add a lighter or waterproof matches too,” she recommends. Gibbons, who lives in Minneapolis, brings a lightweight 3.5-ounceSOL Emergency Bivvyas an emergency sleeping bag. Like carries a thermal blanket on winter mountain runs near his home in Wales, United Kingdom. Follow their lead by bringing a warm layer, just in case you need it. Winter days are shorter, so bring a smallheadlamp(double-check the batteries or rechargeable battery are fullbeforehand). Pack an emergency whistle or alarm, such as theNathan Saferun Ripcord Siren Personal Alarm, that can alert others nearby—especially over blustery gusts—or scare off wildlife. “Check the weather the day before and the day of your run. Mountainweather in the wintercan change quickly to white out conditions,” says Dworecki. If you’ll be surrounded bysteep terrain—such as below a slope that is 30 degrees or greater—read and understand the avalanche conditions with the local or regional forecasting center. “If there’s avalanche danger, you may want to carry a transceiver—that’s a whole other level of precautions in those types of conditions,” says Dworecki. If you plan to trail run or pull onrunning snowshoes, such as theNorthern Lites Race Wave, which are narrower and shorter than regular snowshoes for enhanced mobility in snow, in avalanche terrain, take a certified avalanche education class such asAIARE 1. The American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education offers this beginner-level course for winter recreationists. “Know where you are, your abilities, respect the weather massively, and act accordingly,” says Like. In case of an emergency, “carry your cell phone close to the body, so the battery doesn’t get zapped by thecold temperatures,” says Dworecki. In locations without cell service, pack a satellite communication device to reach out for help or emergency responders if needed, adds Like. For remote winter runs and “especially if you go into the mountains, learn how to navigate using a compass, awatch with GPS, or a GPS device, so that you can backtrack if you need to,” says Dworecki. “It’s good to take a map,” adds Like. Gibbons uses her watch to track breadcrumbs. “If I get lost, I can get back to where I was. Once, a friend and I went off trail to explore and couldn’t find the trail again. I looked at mywatchand we walked 40 feet to the left,” she says. Even if the ground is snowy, variables such as wind, fresh snowfall, or other footprints can cover your tracks orvisibilitycould be poor. So, you want to be extra careful and bring backup to help you navigate. “If it’s -14 degrees Fahrenheit, I’m warm but I’mbreathing in cold airthat hits my precious sweet lungs. You have to put something over your lungs, which I learned after walking away from winter races with lingering bronchitis symptoms,” says Gibbons. Cold, dry air inhaled onlong-distance runscan aggravate the airways and potentially triggerexercise-induced bronchoconstrictionwith respiratory symptoms such ascoughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and decreased endurance, according to theAmerican College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. If the combination of cold temperatures, humidity, and windchill make a deep breath feel piercing or difficult, Gibbons wears aColdAvengermask, which creates a micro-climate in front of the nose and mouth where exhalations humidify. If the conditions are cold but not freezing, like if it’s 30 degrees Fahrenheit out, she’ll wear a Buff over her nose and mouth. Ultimately, Gibbons suggests listening to your body and respecting how your lungs react to cold temperatures, because every person’s health, health history,workout goals, and surrounding environment is different. Generally, if the temperatures are near or below freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit) runners can consider covering your mouth and nose with aneck gaiter. If the temperatures are extremely cold—which for some could be 14 degrees Fahrenheit plus windchill and humidity or 0 degrees Fahrenheit in a dry climate for others—consider wearing a more robust protectiveface mask, especially for intense workouts. Consult your primary care or sports medicine physician before choosing the best method for your health. “It’s paramount to havehydrationand make sure your hydration is available—and doesn’t freeze—through a run or race,” says Like and explains, after taking a drink from abladder, “blow the fluid back into bladder, so it doesn’t freeze in the pipe. The mouth piece can freeze, too, and you often need to squeeze it and break up the ice.” Nutrition barscan also turn into a brick that are difficult or impossible to bite into. Like’s solution: “Before your run, chop up your fuel into smaller, bite-sized pieces.” Dworecki adds that keeping yourfuelandhydrationclose to the body can prevent it from freezing. “I’ll wear the bladder under myjacketand run the tube through my sleeve. I bring extra calories, because when you run low on energy in winter, you can get cold. Also, addingelectrolytesto your hydration lowers the freezing point of water,” she says. This women’s pack has two soft bladders and plenty of additional pockets and pouches. Though it doesn’t come with bottles, this backpack can hold a water reservoir as well as extra gear you may need out on the trail. Have easy access to all your essentials on long runs or races with Nathan’s lightweight running vest. An affordable hydration vest complete with two soft flasks and other minimal storage needs. “I almost always have someone come with me and that’s usually arun buddyfrom my local trailrun group,” says Gibbons. Dworecki suggests the same protocol. Whether you’re on a solo run or with a group, make sure your family, roommates, or friends know yourroute planand when to expect you home, Gibbons and Like agree. Looking for a spot to put these tips into action? These trails, that span the country, offer a scenic spot to chase miles. Washington’s Snoqualmie area is one of Dworecki’s favorites for winter trail runs. “The area can get a lot of snow, especially in mid-winter, and is full of scenic trails with fantastic views such asKendall Peak Lakes,” an 8.3-mile route with 1,871 feet of ascent, she says. “For typically less snow for a winter run in the same region,Mt. Siis a popular trail that can be crowded in the warmer months, so the winter can be an excellent time to go.” “The SuperiorHiking Trailis remote ungroomed singletrack—it’s heaven on earth. The 260-mile route goes to the ancient Sawtooth Mountains, along Lake Superior, and is incredibly beautiful,” says Gibbons. In Minneapolis, her favorite spot for winter trail runs isTheodore Wirth Regional Park, with “huge singletrack—you can be in the city and in the woods and wilderness,” she says. Near the state capitol, head toMatthews Winters Parkfor loops or out-and-back trail runs adjacent to Red Rocks Park and Amphitheater. Or venture to theNordic Ski Capital of Colorado, Crested Butte, to run on the groomed nordic trails that allow foot travel, surrounded by 13,000-foot snow-painted peaks. Check out theGreen Mountain Trails, a singletrack network where the annualSnow Devil Ultra Snowshoe Raceis hosted in Vermont, eight miles north of Killington.

4 Truths About Perimenopause Symptoms and How Exercise Can Help You Find Relief,"The time before menopause can be long, uncomfortable, and confusing. We break down some misconceptions about the transition, so you know what to expect and can get a handle on symptoms. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Perimenopause is a lot like puberty. It’s a hormonal process with many physical and emotional repercussions and a timeline all its own. Likewise, every woman experiences perimenopause differently, explains Shona Hendricks, a Johannesburg, South Africa-based run coach and head of the Female Athlete Program atCoachParry.com, who works primarily with peri- andpostmenopausal runners. Because perimenopause itself is so amorphous, women have a lot of confusion and questions about this time of their lives. To that point, 41-year-oldrecord-setting ultrarunner,Camille Herronspoke directly to this issue in a recentInstagrampost. She described her experience as “all over the place and an unknown.” She’s not alone in feeling this way. According to a2022 online surveyof more than 900 women currently experiencing perimenopause, more than 60 percent felt “not informed at all.” The most common symptoms mentioned by the women were mood swings, brain fog, andfatigue, but those were just a few of many—and women can feel any number of combinations of the wide range of symptoms. Because the symptoms of perimenopause vary so widely andwhenwomen experience these side effects can also be drastically different, many women  don’t always identify that changes in theirsleepor mood are related to perimenopause. Instead, a woman tries to cure one symptom while separating it from others. This can prevent women from successfully finding solutions. “It’s helpful to know what to expect before we’re even there, or just when we’re entering it, so that you’re not wondering, am I just going crazy? Am I just depressed?”Anna Barbieri, M.D., ob-gyn, integrative medicine physician, NAMS-certified menopause practitioner, and a clinical assistant professor at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City tellsRunner’s World. To that end, this guide to perimenopause can help you recognize and manage your symptoms, while also maintaining your fitness and maybe even having your best performances, just likeHerron. According to a 2016articlepublished in theJournal of Women’s Health, perimenopause is a term that describes the “menopausal transition,” the time between having a monthly period and having no period. This transition is not at all immediate, on a schedule, reliable, or quick. “There are no markers, there’s no specific age necessarily, and there are no blood tests that are done to identify this time,” Barbieri says. Most commonly, though, perimenopause starts between the ages of 40 and 44 and can last up to 10 years. However, some women’s symptoms begin in their late 30s. Until you enter perimenopause, estrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall in a very predictable and mannered way. “That all changes during menopause,”Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a North American Menopause Society certified clinician and codirector of the Sexuality, Intimacy and Menopause for cancer survivors program at the Smilow Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut tellsRunner’s World. Whatever your age, you’ll only know you’re experiencing perimenopause when you feel small differences in your body, and not just when it comes to your  period. For example, you may not run quite asfastor you may feel like you have a little lesspowerandstrength. Other areas that might change? Your sleep, body composition, and mood. Change—and the change—should not be feared. Especially because runners and other active women are fortunate in that they are already engaged in the first step to managing symptoms of perimenopause: exercise. While a 2020studypublished inThe Journals of Gerontologyfound that women’s strength and power declined significantly during the menopausal transition, women who remainedphysically activewere able to minimize some of the changes. The key is adapting your workouts not only forperformance, but also to find relief from the results of changing hormone levels like sleep issues, mood swings, and strength losses. To help you navigate this confusing time, we sifted through the misinformation to bring you common myths and the truth about perimenopause and its symptoms, what you may expect from this time of your life, and some first-line solutions for addressing the changes. Myth 1: Erratic periods are the main symptom of perimenopause First steps toward a solution: Talk to your doctor about perimenopause and herbal sleep supplements Runners need their sleep torecoverfrom one workout and have the energy for the next. And while it’s typical to have abad night of sleephere and there, if you wake up in the middle of the night on a regular basis—and you’re in your late 30s or early 40s—you should talk to your doctor about perimenopause. Progesterone, a hormone that predominantly works with the reproductive system and acts on neurotransmitter pathways in the brain, fluctuates throughout the month because of themenstrual cycle, and it has been shown to affect women’s ability to sleep well. A 2023articlein theJournal of the Endocrine Society, for example, says that reproductive hormones, such as progesterone, play a role in sleep quality throughout a woman’s life. While progesterone typically has sleep-promoting effects, a steep decline in this hormone (which can happen throughout perimenopause) can cause sleep disruptions, according to the article. Your doctor can help you figure out the best way to address your changing hormones and subsequent sleep issues (along with other perimenopause symptoms you may be experiencing). But both Minkin and Barbieri also recommend trying herbal supplements, which is also worth asking your medical provider about. Minkin recommendsRemifemin Good Night, a German black cohosh supplement that also contains herbs shown to influence sleep, including valerian root extract, lemon balm extract, and hops strobile. Also, studies have shown thathormone replacement therapy(HRT) can help reduce the perimenopause symptoms that lead to interrupted sleep, including night sweats and other issues. There are two types of HRT, one that women can apply locally to the vagina and a systemic type taken orally or as a patch. Taking HRT requires a detailed discussion with your doctor about your medical history and symptoms, as well as the potential side effects of these medications. Myth 2: Perimenopause only affects reproductive hormones First steps toward a solution: Assess your eating plan, practice mind-body exercise, and consider taking adaptogens The authors of a 2021 longitudinalstudypublished inFrontiers in Global Women’s Health,stated that while estrogen and progesterone decline during perimenopause, cortisol increases. When the reproductive hormones—estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone—begin to unreliably fluctuate during perimenopause, another hormone, cortisol, responds to these alterations in ways that can make women experience mood swings and other physical changes, like increasedbelly fat. This type of fat releasesinflammatorymolecules and contributes to the development of several conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While cortisol increases during exercise and may even improve performance—it is, after all, “the running away from the tiger hormone,” Barbieri says—chronically elevated cortisol levels can increasefatigue, turningtraining runsinto slogs that feel as if you’re traveling through mud. Chronically elevated cortisol can also result in psychological symptoms such as irritability and potentially depressive symptoms. In fact,researchhas shown that women who experience mood disorders, such as depression, may see a rise in symptoms during perimenopause, which may be related to cortisol levels. Fortunately, research also points to the ways women can deal with the relationship between stress, perimenopause, andmood. For example, one article published in 2021 inFocus, says that diet plays a key role in mood disorder management. The authors point to research that links a higher saturated fat consumption to depression. Barbieri suggests making sure you give yourself adequate time to recover from intense workouts to allow yourcortisollevels to come back down. She also suggests limiting foods that result in blood sugar spikes and dips (such as added sugars and processed foods), as this can also affect cortisol levels, according toresearch. Another proven way to reducecortisol levels? Mindfulness practices such asyogaandmeditation. Incorporating these routines between your intense workouts will not only give you active recovery time, but could help to mitigate the cortisol bump. Finally, tryadaptogens, says Barbieri, which are herbs such as ginseng,turmeric,ashwagandha, and holy basil that may reduce feelings of stress. Let your doctor know if you want to try these supplements, as they aren’t regulated by the FDA despite being medicinal. Be patient, too, as you manage your stress symptoms. “Changing one’s cortisol curve is not an overnight project,” Barbieri says. “It may take months.” Myth 3: Forgetfulness and brain fog are inevitable First steps toward a solution: Continue exercising Perimenopause marks the beginning of falling estrogen levels, and estrogen doesn’t only exist in your reproductive system. Most cells in the body have estrogen receptors, including the brain, Minkin explains. The brain relies on estrogen for higher cognitive function, according to a 2015articleinPhysiology Reviews. Estrogen fluctuation affects muscle firing patterns and can create feelings of brain fog and lack of motivation,Stacy T Sims, Ph.D., a New Zealand female athlete performance physiologist and co-author ofRoartellsRunner’s World. While it’s difficult for doctors to quantify brain fog, cognitive complaints, including reduced attention span and memory, are associated with perimenopause, according to a 2021researchpublished inClimacteric. “I went through [perimenopause] very early, at 42,” says Barbieri. “And I thought I had a brain tumor. And I’m a gynecologist. I had a brain MRI, the whole thing. Part of me [didn’t] want to accept that my life [could] be so affected by my own hormones, part of me wanted to believe that I [could] get over it in my own head.” To address brain fog, Barbieri suggestsstrength trainingand regular exercise. Research backs up thebenefits of exercise for brain health. For example, one2022 paperfromClimactericsuggests lifestyle intervention (including diet and exercise) for preventing dementia and improving cognition, and points to a link between higher cardiovascular fitness and lowerdementia risk. Because of research like this, Sims suggests that midlife is a great time for women who haven’t beenweightliftingto add strength training to their routine. If you’re picking up weights, it’s important to note that estrogen modulatesmuscle recoveryand propensity to injury, says Barbieri. So if you feel more joint pain or need more time to recover after runs andstrength workouts, these might also besymptoms of perimenopauseand a clue to take it easy when your body calls for it. Myth 4: Gaining weight is part of the process First steps toward a solution: Try interval workouts and weight training Studies showthat declining estrogen levels contribute to the loss oflean muscle mass, which can lead to changes inbody composition. Body composition is the body’s amount of fat relative to fat-free mass, including muscle and bone (this is different than weight). “We have to adjust the way we train to get similar or the same sort of outputs [as we did before menopause],” says Hendricks. Sims recommendsinterval trainingduring perimenopause and beyond. That could mean either truesprint interval training(SIT) or truehigh-intensity interval training(HIIT). Both put a high demand on your muscles which signals your brain to produce more human growth hormone (HGH) and increase testosterone, which helps you build and maintain muscle mass. Sims offers some workout details: Also, just as Barbieri mentioned in regard to brain fog,strength trainingis also important tomaintain muscle mass, as adults begin to lose muscle at a rate of 3 to 8 percent per decade after 30, according to areviewinCurrent Opinion in Clinical Nutritional and Metabolic Care. To support both the muscle-building aspect of your workouts and healthy body composition, Barbieri recommends at least 0.8 grams ofproteinper pound of bodyweight, which is in line with the amount recommended forathletes. Also, both experts say to make sure you are eatinghealthy fats, as well asfiber-containing, colorful vegetables to support overall health and body composition. In the face of symptoms like brain fog and changes in body composition, many women are hesitant to acknowledge that “it’s just [their] hormones” because they think those words sound like an excuse, as if they are admitting to some great female weakness. But it’s not, it’s biology, says Barbieri. Embracing these changes that come with age may help you achieve another positive aspect of getting older: happiness. A2022 AARPstudy found that older people are happier than both younger people and those in midlife. “I feel like for so many women, the process of perimenopause itself is like an endurance athletic event,” Barbieri adds. The good news is that as a runner, you’re no stranger toendurance events, and it’s likely the fitness habits you already practice will help you manage perimenopause symptoms and lead you into this next phase of life.

The Pros and Cons of Cushioned Running Shoes,"Why you might want a pair of these maximalist trainers in your shoe rotation. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Anything that promises to make running more comfortable is an enticing sell to runners whosefeetpound pavement, track, andtreadmillfor many hours every week. Comfort and bounce are the big allure of shoes with maximal padding. In fact, cushioned running shoes continue to surge in popularity. Visit your local running store, and you’ll encounter a slew of cushioned options, from brands includingBrooks,Nike,Hoka,Saucony, andAltra. But do these shoes offer benefits for performance? We dug into the research and spoke with three experts on the pros and cons of cushioned running shoes. Here’s what you need to know. The definition of “cushioned shoe” is one of those things that falls under the category of “we know it when we see it,” because there is no official definition or description of cushioned shoe. Cushioning “exists on a spectrum,”Matthew Boyd, a physiotherapist and run coach in Alberta, Canada, tellsRunner’s World.A shoe such as Vibram’s FiveFingers provides pretty much zero cushioning whileNike’s Alphaflycontains a maximum amount. “Then there’s a spectrum in between,” Boyd explains, with most shoes falling into a middle range, or what he describes as “typical” cushioning. So, while there isn’t a specific set of criteria for what constitutes a cushioned shoe, they do have a few common attributes. First, cushioned shoes have soft, often thick, padding in the midsole, which is designed to increase shock absorption,Bill McCann, D.P.M., a New Hampshire-based podiatrist, tellsRunner’s World.Compared to shoes with minimal padding, they feel softer and more comfortable on your feet. Second, many of today’s cushioned shoes trend towards a maximalist design, featuring additional layers of foam and other material to make them “higher stack” shoes, meaning the foot plate, or base, sits higher off the ground, Stephen M. Pribut, D.P.M., a Washington D.C.-based podiatrist, tellsRunner’s World. Thanks to materials such as EVA (a plastic and rubber foam), these shoes are light and offer more energy return, McCann points out. In other words, you feel a bounce when you run in them. For certain runners, cushioned shoes can deliver on the promise of making the activity more comfortable. In particular, cushioned shoes may help those with limited range of motion in theirankle,knee, and/orhipjoints, McCann says. That’s because the softness of the shoe triggers a response in your joints and they stiffen to help you stay balanced and upright. Without this response, runners may feel pain if a joint moves beyond a comfortable range, he adds. Cushioned running shoes may also benefitultrarunnersbecause the cushioning is less abrasive against the skin and subcutaneous tissue, reducing the risk of blisters andfoot aches, Boyd explains. Some people assume that heavier runners in particular benefit from cushioned shoes because the soft surface lessens the ground impact forces on their joints. Boyd points to a randomized controlled trial of 848 recreational runners,published in 2019, that debunked this school of thought. The researchers concluded that cushioned shoes provided no protective benefit to heavier runners. On the contrary, the studydidfind a protective effect for lighter runners, but it was fairly small. Additionally, research has shown that some highly cushionedsuper shoes, such as the Nike Vaporfly, significantly improvesperformance. However, “it’s not necessarily the cushioning that’s helping,” Boyd explains. It’s more likely other factors, such as the foam having a certain rebound, the carbon plate, and that they’re extremely light, he says. That said, many runners benefit from putting a maximally cushioned shoe inrotationalongside a moderately cushioned shoe and a more minimally cushioned shoe, Boyd explains. That’s because training with varying degrees of cushioning can increase your tolerance to different stresses and thus reduce your overall risk ofinjury. The key here is variety: For cushioned shoes to be helpful in this context, “you’d need the combo of all the shoes, not just the one shoe,” Boyd says. One big downside of cushioned shoes is they may hamperrunning economy. That’s because increased padding often causes people to land with a slightly straighter knee and with a little harder of aheel strikethat’s further out in front of them, Boyd explains. Often, but not always, runners will also adopt a lowercadencein a cushioned shoe, Boyd adds. “All of these things are generally seen as less helpful when you’re looking at improving running economy,” Boyd says. Moreover, the shock absorption of cushioned shoes can hinder your body’s ability to feel the ground and cause your muscles to activate in response later than normal, which can ultimatelyincreasethe force of impact on your joints, Pribut explains. Indeed, a small 2018studyinvolving 12 male runners, found that running in maximalist cushioned shoes increased impact loading compared to conventional shoes, especially at high speeds. Plus, having your joints stiffen in response to cushioned shoes can cause discomfort for some runners, McCann says. Boyd agrees, saying the biomechanical changes induced by cushioned shoes can exacerbate existing pains andinjuriesfor some athletes. For example, people withankle sprainsor posterior tibial tendinitis (shin splints) would likely do better with a more moderately (versus maximally) cushioned shoe, says Pribut, though this isn’t a one-size-fits-all prescription. Lastly, heavier cushioned shoes with minimal return can be inefficient, though, as mentioned there are plenty of newer cushioned shoes with lightweight designs and good return. “It really depends on the material,” McCann says. In the end, cushioned shoes can change yourbiomechanicsin a way that is helpful for some ailments and unhelpful for others, Boyd says. Sussing out which specific injuries a cushioned shoe could help is nuanced and depends on individual biomechanics, he explains, but in general, runners should avoid grabbing a pair of plush kicks as a solution to their aches and pains. If you’ve previously run well and avoided injuries with cushioned shoes, then feel free to stick with them. “The most important thing is probably what’s worked well in the past,” says Pribut. But if you haven’t given them a whirl before? Consider opting for a more middle-of-the-road shoe first, he says. That said, serious runners may want to consider having multiple shoes in their rotation that offer varying degrees of cushioning, McCann says. Like Boyd explained, this can increase your biomechanical tolerance to different stresses and ultimately reduce overall injury risk. Probably the biggest risk for a running injury is abrupt and drastic change, whether that’s to yourtraining planor to your shoes, Boyd says. “If you’re used to a certain amount of cushioning in your shoes, deviating significantly from that and doing it quite abruptly, that’s a risky strategy,” he says, as it will alter your biomechanics. If you’ve never donned cushioned shoes before, but are curious to try out a pair, wear them for no more than 10 to 20 percent of your totalweekly volume, suggests Boyd. If you’re feeling good after a few weeks, you can slip them on more frequently, though again, your best bet is to rotate through a diverse stable of trainers versus wearing the same pair for every run.

Dietitian vs Nutritionist: What’s the Difference?,"How to tell who’s legit and who’s just good at marketing. A nutrition pro can help you optimize yourfueling strategyand mitigate common running-related issues ranging from postworkoutenergycrashes to midrunbathroomtrips. But knowing who to trust with your health is tricky. “Expert” is a relative term, and it turns out that the meaning of “nutritionist” varies depending on who you’re talking to. So, how do you know who’s legit? For advice on finding a qualified practitioner (and knowing who to avoid), we spoke with three registered dietitians about the difference between a dietitian versus nutritionist. Here’s what you need to know. The difference between a nutritionist and a dietitian comes down to education, experience, and credentials. Registered dietitians (RD) are trained at the university level, andstarting in 2024, they must have at least a graduate-level degree to be eligible to take theCommission on Dietetic Registration’s (CDR)exam to earn the RD designation. Prospective registered dietitians also participate in an internship where they accrue between 900 and 1,200 hours of supervised practice. Acertified nutrition specialist (CNS)has similar training to a registered dietitian but is accredited through theAmerican Nutrition Association (ANA), which requires that test takers have a master of science or doctoral degree in nutrition or a related field. Like registered dietitians, they must also complete around 1,000 hours of supervised practice. Both registered dietitians and certified nutrition specialists are required to obtain separate licenses in the states where they practice and regularly earn continuing education credits to keep their accreditations. The requirements or qualifications for a “nutritionist” or “nutrition coach” are far less rigorous. In fact, there are none. “Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist,” saysMarie Spano, MS, RD, CSCS, CSSD, sports dietitian. “There’s no regulation behind that term.” Some nutritionists earn certificates through universities or private companies, but coursework varies from one institution to the next, and there are no universal standards for program evaluation or testing. Some nutritionists forgo formal education altogether, relying on their own research or personal experience to inform their work. If you have any nutrition-related illnesses, a nutritionist who’s not an RD or CNS technically is not allowed to treat you—that includesmeal planning, diet recommendations, orsupplementation. “Let’s say someone has hypertension ordiabetesor even gastrointestinal conditions. It’s not legal for [health coaches or nutritionists] in many states to intervene,” saysGabriela Barreto, MS, RD, CSSD. A nutritionist can provide general dietary recommendations to people with uncomplicated health histories. And for people who need a little extra support as they attempt to shift their behaviors around food, a nutrition coach may offer the encouragement and accountability you need. But again, there’s no assurance that a nutritionist’s advice is backed by formal education or rooted in science. “A dietitian is a board-certified expert on food and nutrition,” says Joanna Gregg, RD, Food Data Curator atMyFitnessPal. “Dietitians go through schooling to become experts on the science of food and how it affects human health. They’re trained in medical nutrition therapy and nutrition counseling for a wide range of demographics and can be certified further in a specialty such as sports, weight management, oncology,disordered eating, or pediatric nutrition.” Dietitians who specifically work with runners help their clients improve their performance, train more effectively, and feel better during andafter workouts. This often starts withfueling recommendationsthat are more personalized. “A dietitian who understands energy output is going to listen to what you’re doing every day. They’re going to understand your speed and your distance and be able to estimate how much energy you’re using,” and, therefore, how manycaloriesyou need to consume, Barreto says. They can also monitor your progress, recognize trends you may not notice, and continually fine-tune yourfueling strategies. “We can also help with proper nutrient timing,” Spano says. Runners are more than familiar with preracecarbo-loading, but they often drop the ball during therecoveryperiod when a bowl ofpastais less appealing. “Especially when it comes to an endurance-based athlete, that hour after training is a really pivotal time to get in nutrients,” Barreto says, noting that dietitians who work with athletes are well-versed in sportsnutrition productsand can pick the most appropriate drinks, shakes, gels, and bars based on their clients’ needs. For some runners, fueling and nutrient timing aren’t their most pressing concerns. Both Spano and Barreto often work with athletes who have food fear or disordered eating habits, as well as other medical nutrition issues that can interfere with running. “We can also help with blood testing or other testing that may be needed to ensure that the individual is healthy,” Spano says. While hiring a dietitian is an investment—rates vary, but you can probably expect to pay at least $150 per hour without insurance—it could save you time and money in the long run. There’s no shortage of free nutritional advice online, but culling through the clutter to find information that’s accurate and relevant to your body, sport, and personal goals is daunting. “You can spend all day on the internet looking up stuff, but it doesn’t mean that you can put it all together if you’re not an expert in that area,” Spano says. Even the most nutrition-conscious runners make mistakes. Barreto notes that runners who use online activity calculators are often undereating by hundreds of calories, which leads tofatigue,headaches, and subpar performance. Spano agrees that undereating is a common problem among runners, especially women. She also finds that runners who are hyper-focused on eatinghealthy foodsare often consuming too muchfiber, which can lead to gastrointestinal distress. After consulting with a dietitian, you may also find that you’re spending money unnecessarily on nutrition-related products that you don’t actually need. “A sports dietitian can help with efficacious supplements. And it’s not just about which supplements work. Oftentimes, I’m weeding out things thatdon’twork,” Spano says. “So a runner might come to me, and I’ll say, ‘You don’t need to take this, this, and this.’ And they’re like, ‘Oh, thank god. I’m tired of doing this routine.’ So, we’re helping them save money and time and wasted effort.” Finding the right dietitian is a lot like finding the right doctor or therapist; some are more qualified than others, and it may take time to link up with a practitioner who feels like the right fit for you and your needs. Use these tips for a successful search. You can always Google “dietitians near me,” but if you want to narrow your search, check out theAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics’sonlinedatabaseof nutrition experts. You can search by location, specialty, and insurance, and each practitioner’s contact information and credentials are clearly listed. Remember: There are no regulations for the terms “nutritionist” or “nutrition coach.” Look for a professional who’s a registered dietitian (RD) or certified nutrition specialist (CNS). The scope of nutrition is broad, so dietitians tend to specialize in one area. Choose someone who, in addition to having RD or CNS in their title, also has CSSD, which stands for “certified specialist in sports dietetics.” This indicates that they’ve undergone additional training to work with athletes. “Have a phone call. Talk to them and ask them how they work with clients, and tell them about your specific needs. Ask them about their experience,” Spano suggests. And make sure they understand your specific population, as the needs of anultramarathonerwill differ from those of a triathlete or someone who’s training for theirfirst 10K. “There are little ins and outs to every sport and population, even if you drill down to how you carry your gel packs. Somebody who knows the sport will understand what’s realistic in different situations,” Spano adds. Symptoms of Magnesium Deficiency What Are the Benefits of Creatine for Runners?

Beginner Running Tips to Help You Kick Off a Consistent Schedule,"Coaches, pro runners, and shoe specialists offer their best advice to make the most of your miles. If you’re convinced of all thebenefits you’ll gain from running, but aren’t sure how toget startedor even what you need to know before you head out the door, we got you. We chatted with coaches, pro runners, and shoe specialists for their best beginner running tips. Before yousign up for a 5Kor even buy a new pair ofrunning shoes, follow this advice for starting out on the right foot—and make running a lifelong habit. When you’re first starting out,paceshould be the least of your worries. Just lace up your shoes, hit the road, and try to hold a pace you can maintain for your entire run. “Focus on one mile at a time,” says former pro triathlete and Ironman Champion,Linsey Corbin. “You never know what is going to happen up the road. Running one mile at a time—and not focusing on the whole picture—helps you stay focused on the process versus the outcome.” If you find yourself too focused on how fast you’re running, professional ultrarunnerKatie Asmuthrecommends going out for atrail run. The hills, roots, and rocks will help you “forget your pace and your worries, and enjoy the scenery around you,” she says. According to Corbin, “comparison is the thief of joy.” When you’re worried about what the runners around you are doing, you lose focus on your own personal journey. “The best results come when you focus on yourself. Looking around at what everyone else is doing is almost guaranteed that you will never be satisfied,” says Corbin. Danny Mackey, coach of the Brooks Beasts professional track club, echoes Corbin’s sentiments: “Be mindful that everyone progresses and improves at different rates.  Some days, you have to balance what’s best for you. That might meanrunning sloweror quicker compared to another person.  Running is a lifelong sport, so compare against yourself first.” Like it or not,running is hard. You’re putting your entire body to work, from yourarmsto yourfeet. Once you understand that, it’s easier to push yourself to the limit. That doesn’t mean you shouldalwaysfeel uncomfortable.Easy runs, for example, are meant to feel easy.  But when you’re out for aharder runor running your first race, you have to be okay with the challenge. “How you feel while running isn’t always predictable, so dial in what you can control,” says Asmuth. The goal is to be uncomfortable, but in command of your body. In order to run happy, healthy, and consistently, you should have a good pair (or two) ofrunning shoes. Everyone’sstrideis different, which makes picking the right shoe a personalized experience. Your local specialty running store is the best place to go for a fitting. The staff members are specifically trained to properlysize your feet, determine whether youoverpronate, and inform you on the different brands and styles out there. Michael Zabrodski, vice president of operations atPhiladelphia Runner, warns new runners not to be swayed by fashion: “Making sure it is the right shoe for your specific needs is paramount. If the shoe doesn’t perform for you, then it doesn’t really matter what it looks like.” Running coachYusuf Jeffersbelieves that “there isn’t an athlete out there who hasn’t experienced some form ofinjuryat one point or another while practicing their sport.” Therefore, it’s important to know when your body is at it’s limit. When feeling unnaturalaches or painson a run, it’s better to stop early and try again tomorrow than to force through. “Running is a highly repetitive motion sport, it leaves one particularly vulnerable to overuse andovertraining injuries,” says Jeffers. So when you feel like you might be overdoing it, refer to the next tip. Professional 1500-meter runnerDavid Ribichof the Nike Union Athletics Club compares runners to batteries: “At full charge we have maximum capabilities, ready for any demand that comes our way. If we work hard and get our bodies’ battery life down before we recharge, we eitherovertrain, getinjured, or feel bad.” However, it doesn’t always make sense to take a completerest day. Sometimes it’s just helpful to shake things up andcross-train—whether on a bike or in the pool orgym. “Movement is medicine,” says 25K American record holderParker Stinson. “Your body and mind will appreciate you taking the day off from running, but still finding a way to get some blood flow into thosesore muscles.” Running is a sport that requires diligence and dedication over time to see continued success. However, you have to be patient whenbuilding up your mileage. There’s no shortcut—jumping right to high mileage can lead to injury. James Randon, professional 1500-meter runner, suggests that when you first start running, focus on the number ofdays you run a weekrather than the length of each run. Once you get up to five or six days a week, you can gradually increase your mileage. Once you get to aconsistentmileage, Randon recommends tracking your training using an app likeStravaor FinalSurge. “You will find patterns that may have lead to a recent flair up or injury,” says Randon. “Using this data, you can quickly isolate what causes hiccups in training or may be preventing further mileage increases.” Running is often seen as an individual sport. Sometimes, it can even feel lonely. That’s whyElliott Heath, coach of the Bowerman Track Club Elite, recommends running with a group. “The runs will go by faster, you and your running partners will hold each other accountable to a regular routine, and you will all improve together,” he says. The best way to find a running group is to head to your local running store. They typically set up group runs or can point you to any number ofrunning clubsin your area.

Do Warmup and Cooldown Miles Count Toward Weekly Mileage?,"Plus, what training variable you probably want to pay attention to more than weekly mileage. It’s a common ritual to sandwich your runs between a warmup and cooldown. And throughout your week, these miles add up and can count toward yourweekly mileage—atraining metricthat can help you track your progress. But just because youcancount them, doesn’t mean youshould. Some coaches, experts, or runners argue that these easy miles are not stimulating enough to count toward that weekly mileage number, considering you should runwarmupsandcooldownsat a super easy pace that doesn’t leave youfatigued. So we spoke to coaches on both sides of the weekly mileage argument to find out what exactly counts toward this goal number. We also got the scoop on the significance of weekly mileage and expert advice on why you need warmups and cooldowns and what they should look like. Sage Canaday, ultramarathoner and run coach atHigher Running, explains that weekly mileage is an important tool that runners can use to evaluate progress over time. “At Higher Running, we often emphasize mileage as part of the totaltraining loadstress and how we program a training plan,” he says. Weekly mileage is often monitored to make sure an athlete isn’tovertrainingor risking injury from trying torun too muchtoo soon in a training cycle, Canaday adds. He believes that weekly mileage also helps endurance runners build anaerobic base, and that buildingenduranceand stamina comes from consistent weekly mileage totals met over time.  Don’t get so carried away in becoming a mileage junkie, though. “Weekly mileage is a general metric,” saysMegan Wagenaar, assistant cross-country coach at Portland State andBowerman Track Club Elitemember. It doesn’t need to be super specific; if you run 6.8 miles, you can log seven. There are a lot of different metrics that you need to look at with training, and weekly mileage is just one of them, Wagenaar adds. “It is one of the metrics that you can look at when you are just looking at generaltime on your feet. It is not the most important metric. It is just one of the pieces,” Wagenaar explains. For all runners—beginners,half marathoners,marathoners, and elites—the key is to look at the bigger picture, Wagenaar continues. “Mileage is a supportive role, not the main character,” she says. Weekly mileage can be used as a general tool to spot trends in training, and see how muchstressyou’re putting on your body, but it’s not going to automatically get you aPR. “It really depends on your goal,” says Wagenaar. She explains that if you want to race for completion, then warmup and cooldown mileage is definitely countable. If you have a specific goal toget faster, then intensity should be your focus over mileage anyway (more on that below!).  Say you’re doing a seven-mileinterval workoutone day during yourhalf marathon training. Of course, you’re going to count the two-mile warmup toward your total mileage. Three days later, you go out for an easy eight-milelong runbut the warmup consists ofdynamic stretchingand a half-mile jog. Do you still count that half-mile along with all the miles you ran that week? Canaday counts every tenth of a mile. He suggests counting not only warmup and cooldown mileage, but also anyrest jogs in between interval workouts. “If you’re out there moving around and promoting blood flow and getting the heart rate up into zone 1 or higher, then you are putting in mileage,” says Canaday. ​​He explains that total mileage—warmups and cooldowns included—can be increased over time in order to build strength and speed, ultimately boosting performance. Research also shows that running high mileage may make you more efficient and therefore, expend less energy during your workouts. Astudypublished in theJournal of Applied Psychologyin 2016 examined two groups of runners who had already been running for six months: one that consistently ran 30 or more miles per week and another that ran less than 10 miles per week. The researchers monitored the activity of the thigh muscles and knee joint movements when all runners tackled four different speeds. The high-mileage group showed neuromuscular changes that improved theirefficiency, allowing them to do less work when covering the same distance as the low-mileage group. They also had more spring-like reactions in the lower leg tendons that helped propel them forward. And these advantages were even more evident at faster speeds. Keeping track of your hard mileage—your quality miles—is “the important piece of the puzzle that a lot of people may be missing,” Wagenaar says. And a warmup or cooldown does not necessarily contribute to quality training time, she explains. Wagenaar also suggests that intensity is the more important metric, compared to mileage, when it comes torunning faster. “The more time you spend closer to at or around race pace, the better you’re going to get at it,” she says. Intensity work includesthreshold pace,speed work, andrace pace, and you can track intensity effort in either minutes or miles, according to Wagenaar. In any given quality workout, she recommends aiming for about 20 minutes of intensity work. Wagenaar also suggests gradually building intensity just as you would increase weekly mileage—whether that means pushing your speed or hittingrace pacemore often—when looking to progress or during focused training. The 80/20 rule is a good ratio to follow for tracking intensity: Aim for 80 percent of training made up of warmups, cooldowns, easy runs, and long runs, while 20 percent is all the work you do at or near race pace, Wagarnaar suggests. Research also indicates that training with more speed and fewer miles can get you that shiny new PR. Astudypublished inPhysiological Reportsin 2018, involving 20 male and female runners, looked at adding 10 extra sessions of speed training (five to 10 reps of 30-second max-effort intervals) and reducing weekly training volumes by 36 percent for six weeks. By doing so, the runners’ average 10K time improved by 3.2 percent, which looks like a 50-minute 10K brought down to about 48:30. Every aspect of training should have a purpose, and warmups and cooldowns are no exception. In short,warmupsprepare our muscles for the run ahead, whilecooldownsallow us to recover from a hard effort. Research backs up the benefits of both practices: A systematic review andmeta-analysispublished in 2010 inThe Journal of Strength and Conditioning Researchexamined 32 studies on the effects of warmup on athletic performance and found in 79 percent of the research included, performance improved after a warmup. Cooldowns help to flush out the muscles and get the blood moving, according to Wagenaar. And anarrative reviewpublished inSports Medicinein 2018 examined the effects of active cooldowns, and found they can potentially enhance next-day performance. Your warmup or cooldown regimen can vary from day to day. Canaday recommends that athletes run for at least 10 to 15 minutes before a quality workout. Depending on the runner’s fitness level, this can range anywhere from a half-mile to two miles or more. Canaday generally suggests that the higher the intensity of the workout, the more elaborate the warmup. “If you have something fairly intense like400-meter repeatsway faster than5K race pace, then I’d make sure the warmup jog is at least 10 to 20 minutes and that it includes somestridesafter some light dynamic stretching,” he says. For lower-intensity workouts, the warmup can be less elaborate. Before atempo run, for example, Canaday recommends 10 minutes of easy running; adding in strides and dynamic stretching is less critical. For cooldowns, aim for just five to 10 minutes of easy jogging. Wagenaar explains that after a tough race, it may not be beneficial to push throughnauseaor other ailments, so a shortened jog cooldown or an easy walk may be best.

"Coach Jess Shares Her Best Advice for Running Strong, Getting Faster, and Staying Healthy","Build lifelong motivation, turn setbacks into PRs, and crush her favorite workout. Jess Movold springs off her living room floor like a superhero taking flight. With a soft landing, she bounces back up 11 more times to complete the set of jumpsquats. She’s already led her Instagram Live audience through a series of dead bugs, jumpinglunges, and froggers, but cheers her followers on as if she has an extra set of lungs. “Don’t stop, don’t cheat yourself,” Movold implores. “If I can do it, you can do it! We can do it together!” Through the 38-minute broadcast, seen by more than 75,000, she also thanks commenters for shout-outs—“Glad you enjoy the coaching! Five seconds to go…”She drops in training tips, like how to speed recovery between exercises—“Biiiiiig inhale between efforts!” She even makes the case for not hating burpees during theburpees—“undeniable full-body strength!” Movold started these Wednesday strength sessions for runners in March, as the Manhattan studios where she’d led strength and running classes closed for public health restrictions. In her typical undaunted manner, she took her classes into her apartment and invited the world to join her. Now, the world is showing up. Movold spent her childhood avoiding the long miles she now celebrates. Every morning, her dad, and eventually her older sister, ran a three- to five-mile loop around their hometown of Hermann, Missouri, a one-stoplight town 90 minutes west of St. Louis. Movold steadfastly declined her dad’s invitations, all the while wondering how he was always so positivein the mornings. But as she entered junior high, she was drawn to the speed of her school’s track sprinters. Movold loved the “run hard, but die fast” mentality of the workouts, and reached the state championships in the 4x200 relay as a senior. When she entered Missouri State University after high school, Movold focused on a career in fashion and forgot about running. Her dedication earned her an internship at Tommy Hilfiger in New York City. But like most New York commuters, she was forced to play subway roulette, often finding herself on the losing end of delays, construction, and packed cars. Her consolation prize: a sprint across four avenues to make it on time. “I started running like a crazy person in my intern outfit with heels in my bag,” Movold says. The morning commutes inspired Movold to run for more than the sake of punctuality. “I used to think you could only run on atreadmillor a path, but running to my office showed me that in a city, you have everywhere to run,” says Movold. By the end of the summer, she’d logged so many miles that she had decided to train for her first marathon. Movold turned that internship with Tommy Hilfiger into an entry-level job and then another job, and then another as she established herself in the fashion world. But the long hours and hustling to complete absurd requests—like finding her boss a steak and salad at 7:30 a.m., or delivering his weekend spending money via a helicopter—grated on Movold. “I was basically Anne Hathaway inThe Devil Wears Prada.” There was a bright spot: Movold’s running habit from her intern days had stuck. Colleagues asked her for training advice, and at photo shoots she’d convince curious photographers and models that despite their doubts,yes!they really could be runners. “I started to recognize that those were the only times I felt alive at work,” she says. In 2016, Movold told her steak-for-breakfast boss that she was quitting. To her surprise, he challenged her. “He was playing me,” she says, “trying to get me to stay, saying he understood it was too challenging, too much pressure, that the mountain was too steep.” “I told him, no, it’s the wrong mountain.” As Movold was exiting the fashion world, she also began working out at The Fort, a gym in Manhattan. Just like the runners at her office, other athletes at the gym noticed her—and her endless enthusiasm for sweating until she was on the floor exhausted. A few asked if she was taking on clients to train, and she helped without thinking, or even asking for payment. “Starting to coach was such a joy, nothing felt like work,” she says. Movold realized she needed a more professional mind-set to succeed. And beyond billing, she earned certifications from the Road Runners Club of America and the National Academy of Sports Medicine to coach and train athletes. She’s since become a senior coach at The Fort, in addition to joiningRunner’s Worldand the Mile High Run Club. Her new career works a 5–9 schedule, she says with a laugh. Normally she’d wake around 5 a.m. for her first client and finish when her final evening class wraps. The fashion world prepared her for the demanding hours, though none of her current clients make 10 p.m. requests for live goldfish. All day, her mood is unflinchingly upbeat: energized, she says, by each interaction with an athlete in need of guidance. “I’m a vessel for motivation for my athletes,” she says. “I find their ‘why’ and reflect it back.” With gyms still closed, Movold is separated from her runners. But she’s undeterred, thriving even. “I never saw myself as a microphone-and-lights instructor, the center of attention,” she says. Her days are still long, but in leadingher living room workouts, texting clients, and coaching Runner’s World+ members, Movold knows she’s climbing the right mountain. Goals, like finishing a marathon, and structure, like a workout plan, are essential for guiding runners through a season. But Movold says the key to maintaining a long-term relationship with running is finding what really drives you—whether it’s a new sense of confidence or getting off medication. “Identifying this unlocks everything that’s possible for a runner,” says Movold. That understanding of why you put on your running shoes can be used to hold yourself accountable when you’re distracted or discouraged by short-term goals. Whether or not you nail a speed session, those inner passions will persist to drive you. Whether it’s injury, missing a PR, or having a race—or season—canceled, failure is an inevitable part of running. But falling short of a goal doesn’t negate all the work put in along the way, says Movold. “Running is about learning about yourself and honing a skill over time so that each training cycle, race, and experience builds on what you’ve already accomplished.” All that physical and mental hard work will make future goals more attainable. “And if you’re still feeling that salty about it,” says Movold, “use that as motivation to take training a little bit more seriously or fine-tune an aspect, like mobility, if an injury set you back.” In preparing to break three hours in her next marathon, Movold keeps going back to this interval workout. Getting the most out of it hinges on maintaining the right pace; you’re looking to run at or just below goal race pace, Movold says. It should feel tough, but not impossible. Start with an easy two-mile warmup, followed by eight 1K repeats at half-marathon to marathon goal pace. Jog for two minutes to recover between each repeat. Finish the workout with a two-mile cooldown. Years ago, Movold had a coach who she just didn’t connect with. She felt like she was never fast enough. Rather than being internally motivated, she started running to impress him. “I ran every single run at race pace to fool myself. I didn’t accept my current level of fitness,” Movold says. “I tried to rush it, which led to a stress fracture, not running the Boston Marathon, and being sidelined for two months.” It’s easy, Movold says, to let the external pressures of social media and other people’s expectations work against you. But after her injury healed, she was able to find joy (and success) in running by accepting her fitness and avoiding the frustration of failing to meet unreasonable goals. Reconnecting with running and making it a habit again is intimidating, says Movold. “It’s disappointing to realize you’ve lost a step, and the fear of failure can creep in.” So Movold tells athletes to start with a simple commitment to run for 30 minutes without paying attention to pace or distance. It’s how she got moving again after her stress fracture, she says, because it rebuilds the habit of regular runs without the distraction of past fitness markers. When they’re ready to start tracking progress, she’ll have them measure out their 30-minute run and then try to cover the distance faster the next week to create new goals as their fitness returns.

This Runner Went from the Couch to a 26.2 in 4 Months—and Then Finished All 6 Major Marathons,"“The biggest thing was that all of this was for good: It was good for my mental health, it was good for me physically, and I raised a ton of money for charity.” We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Name:Yianni KonstantopoulosAge:44Hometown:Gaithersburg, MarylandOccupation:RealtorTime Running:20 years (on and off)Reason for Running:One word: discipline. I hated running for a while, but I love what it has done for me the past couple of years. I ran the Marine Corps Marathon when I was 28 years old, and again when I was 30—that was in 2010. But then I didn’t run another block until more than a decade later. By April 2022, I had two kids, was just coming off of a divorce, and weighed 330 pounds. A lifelong friend from high school,Drew Saelens, who is a running coach and sub-three-hour marathoner, suggested I sign up to run the Berlin Marathon that fall, adding that because it’s a lottery, I probably wouldn’t get in. Well, I got in, and if I get into anything, I’m going to do it the best I can. Istarted trainingwith Drew and he suggested I get a dietitian as well. He told me flat out: A marathon owes you nothing. If you don’t put in the training, the time, and the miles, you’re going tobonk. I literally went from being on the couch to running 26.2 miles in four months, and it’s because Drew put me on a plan and I needed to do it. I was running four days a week building up to a 42-mile peak mileage week. But I think the discipline is multifaceted—it’s also watching what you eat, making sure that you get yoursleep, and that you’rehydrating. At the beginning, it sucked. I couldn’t go two miles without stopping to catch my breath. But slowly, two miles turned into four miles and then four miles turned into six miles and six miles turned into nine. Eventually, it got to a point where if I wasn’t going on a run, I would get all antsy. I came to appreciate the planning and discipline that went into a 15-mile training run on a Saturday morning in the heat of summer, for example. I found it cathartic to figure it all out: It’s a 4:45 a.m. wake-up and you’re going to have toeat your breakfastand go to thebathroomand do your routine by 5:15 a.m. and you’re going to get out by 5:30 a.m., otherwise you’re going to melt because if you leave the house at 8:00 a.m. and it’s 98 degrees in D.C. with 80 percenthumidity, you’re going to literally be an animal on the side of the road panting in the heat. That was my motivation. It sucks having to wake up early when you don’treallyhave to, but when you do it for 10 days in a row, well the next thing you know, the 12th day you wake up before the alarm goes off and your body’s like, okay, put on yourshoesand get your ass out there, and it feels great. That part, for me, was a really big kick in the pants. It carried over into all of the other aspects of my life, from the way I treat my business to the way I think about time blocking to making sure I’m spending quality time with my kids. It’s all a matter of having a process and a plan and maintaining that discipline. Running, for me, not only was the path to seeing that, but the results obtained from the running reinforced why the discipline’s important. I made it to the starting line in Berlin feeling pretty good, and I finished in 4:44, almost a full hour faster than my previous personal record a decade ago. But I was just getting started. It was training for Berlin that made me realize that there are these other five amazing races [theAbbott World Marathon Majors], and I thought it was just a matter of signing up. I had no idea that for some of them, if you don’t get in based on time qualification, you’re out of luck... unless of course you run for charity. That’s when I learned aboutBack on My Feet, a non-profit with a mission to fight homelessness through fitness. I was able to raise funds, meet a bunch of great people, and I did four out of the six Majors through that organization: London (April 2023), Chicago (October 2023), New York (November 2023), and Boston (April 2024). Plus, the mission to end homelessness aligns really well with my career in real estate. In London, I knocked off another 25 minutes from my marathon PR and finished in 4:20. I knocked another 11 minutes off in Chicago, finishing in 4:09. Logistics-wise, I loved Chicago. I did a boat tour and it was fun to do myshakeout runsalong the lake. And it didn’t hurt that my hotel was like two blocks from the starting line. At that point, honestly, I was a little bit tired. I probably got a little bit cocky. I missed a couple ofworkouts. So by the time New York rolled around, just a month after Chicago, I tacked on time, finishing 4:48. But in New York, the people, the cheering, when you get on Fifth Avenue, you feel like a professional athlete. That is something that words can’t describe. For Tokyo, which I just ran in February of this year, I raised money for the UN High Commission for Refugees, the Japanese chapter. They required fundraisers to raise about the equivalent of $600, but I told them I’d raise double that, and I think that’s why I got in. I thought it was going to go really well in Tokyo. I had a good winter training session, but it was hotter than I anticipated and I finished in 4:54. Finally, I ran Boston this past April and it was one of the most memorable marathons,  as I knew that my kids were waiting for me at the finish line. Boston was a pretty epic course and the crowds were phenomenal from the start through each little township on the way to the center of Boston. I finished at 4:54 and know that I can do better. I never thought I would get all six stars, but I committed to it, so I had to do it! Over the course of this journey, I also lost 100 pounds. I had to get all new clothes. My body feels better; I look good in the mirror. Mykneesdon’t hurt when I get out of bed. And it doesn’t get any better than my kids noticing I’m in better health and I can play with them longer. For me, the biggest thing was that all of this was for good. It was good for mymental health, it was good for me physically, and I raised a ton of money for charity. All of these things just add up into a really great win, and I’m excited to keep at it. Specifically, I want to break 3:54, which is my brother’s PR. That was 25 years ago, but he’s like, “I’m still thefastest marathonerin the family.” We’re two competitive brothers, so part of me has to break 3:54 just so I can make him stop talking about it. I’ll probably run another marathon in 2025 but in the meantime, I’m interested in getting afaster half-marathontime and taking on other challenges like a 5K per day for a month. I went full circle from not doing any exercise to working really hard at getting better and faster and healthier. The best thing about running is it truly is one foot in front of the other, and you just have to keep at it. It’s those little gains that incrementally over time transcend into incredible results. There are going to be days that you’ve got to push through because you’ve just got to do it, but if you feel like you’ve tweaked something, don’t push it too hard and make theinjuryworse. It’s like the old Wayne Gretzky quote: “You miss 100 percent of the shots that you don’t take.” You have to believe in yourself, and you have to want to do it, whether it’s run yourfirst marathonor go after a time goal or raise money for charity to participate. Whatever the challenge is, you have to have the belief that you can knock out the hurdles. A 16-weektraining plansounds super daunting at the beginning, but when you get through week one, you look back and you say, “okay, week one is done.” It gives you the motivation to think about knocking out week two. Look at the plan like tiny checkboxes or dominoes. If you can knock out more of the dominoes and more of the checkboxes, then you’re going to figure it out. In conjunction with my training, I threw myself into some self-help books, including those by retired U.S. Navy Seal Jocko Willink who writes about discipline. It’s kind of bizarre to even think that I have gear for these things now! I invested in clothing that was meant for running and now my bottom dresser drawer is dedicated to only running stuff. →Shockz OpenRun Pro headphones: These are amazing.

Des Linden’s Tips for Outsmarting the Marathon,"The 2018 Boston champ used these mental strategies to defeat the distance. When Desiree Linden was at Arizona State University, coach Walt Drenth asked every runner to write a race plan before each cross-country meet. Linden continues the practice to this day. It appeals to her analytical nature, and she’ll vouch that it can help you break amarathondown into manageable sections. Here are four more Linden-approved tips for getting your mind ready to tackle 26.2. “Thinking how bad you’re hurting with six miles to go allows you to feel sorry for yourself,” she says. “That gives you a reason to slow down.” Instead, break down the race into segments, however small they have to be—the next sign, the next stoplight. For midpackers, Linden advises challenging yourself, ""Can you pass one person? Can you pass five?"" [Stay injury free on the road by getting on the mat withYoga for Runners.] Ask yourself, ""What am I supposed to do right now?"" Her personal race plans always include: Get out in a good spot; settle in; find your race pace; find your breathing pattern; make sure you get your fluids; drink early; drink often. When each is done, cross it off. Then ask what’s next. Stick to a set plan, and you’ll have less head space for self-doubt, she adds. Linden is motivated by showing up for her team—her husband, coach, friends, agent. “I don’t want to let those people down,” she says. “I don’t want to get to the finish and be like, ‘Well, I totally got soft after mile 22. Sorry, guys.’ ” When you sign up for a marathon, you’re volunteering to find out, “How much hurt can I put myself through?” Linden says. Be proud of the answer.

Our Favorite Gifts for Tech-Savvy Runners,"Stumped on how to tell a gadget-obsessed runner you care? We’ve got you covered. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Looking for a useful,affordable,meaningful giftfor family and friends who run? Our Test Zone experts are here to help. We thoroughly test and review hundreds of products each year so that we can recommend the best options for your unique needs. If the newest gadget is what therunner in your lifeis constantly pining for, these products might just help. Apple refreshed its smartwatch to be faster and brighter, thanks to a new chip. It now tracks sleep and, since that means it needs to be recharged while you’re awake, the battery can be topped off in just 1.5 hours. Though we find it’s always faster, often back to 100 percent by the time we get done showering and eating breakfast. Apple is touting its new blood oxygen sensor, though it’s not really a running-fitness gauge so runners may not find as useful as more sedentary users. The Bose Sport Earbuds are a leap forward from the first generation SoundSport Free. Those older buds were enormous—sticking out of your head like the neck bolts on Frankenstein’s monster. The new buds, however, barely protrude from your ears and are completely button-free (touch gestures play/pause and skip tracks, while tapping and holding activates a phone’s voice assistant). But they still have the great design that doesn’t completely seal your ear, blending excellent audio quality with a comfortable fit which eliminates the dreaded thump you get with each stride when wearing typical earbuds. This new smart watch is the closest competitor to an Apple Watch—basically like Fitbit’s Versa sports watch with extra sensors, which include an ECG, blood oxygen monitor, and a stress scanner (all features found on Apple Watch Series 6). The sleek square-oval design affords plenty of real estate to read splits on the run. Though we found the display doesn’t always light up when we raised our wrist and the touchscreen is somewhat unresponsive to exceptionally sweaty fingers. What makes it stand out from other smart watches: It offers all those sensors and around-the-clock health monitoring, yet the battery will go five days between charges. This butter bean-shaped massage gun is a breeze to hold and fits easily into a duffel bag for road trips. Plus, since the battery lasts more than two hours, the charging cable need not come along for a weekend vacation. It has three speeds but doesn’t connect to a Bluetooth-enabled app, so you don’t get the extra guidance that pricier options now offer. It comes with the standard ball head only, but you can order other tips like the cone for an extra $20. The Forerunner 945 is the most feature-packed ForerunnerGPS watchyet. It supports music playback and stores up to 1,000 songs, plus displays color maps so you can find your way around new cities without getting lost. This Swedish brand is new to the U.S. and brings power unlike what we typically see in running headlamps. The Trail Speed 4XT has a spotlight that can compete with a car’s low beams. At its brightest, it cranks 1,200 lumens but, for actual usefulness, dial it back to extend run time all night. You need a big battery to power that torch, though, and Silva smartly positioned it on the back of a thick headband—a top strap is required to stabilize the load. The overhauled Pace GPS watch is laser-focused on delivering the best, lightest, fastest run-tracking experience on the roads and during speedwork. It has just what a runner needs for training without a bunch of workout types and metrics they’re likely to never use. It tracks distance as accurately as any other watch we’ve tested and, at just 29 grams, is the lightest GPS watch on the market right now. Despite that, it still has a battery that will last up to 30 hours. Hyperice and Theragun both have Bluetooth-enabled massage guns. So, too, does Addaday, maker of therapy devices that cost a fraction of other options. Regardless of the price, Addaday doesn’t skimp on quality. This version of the BioZoom connects to a smartphone app for guided recovery sessions. And the long, grippy handle makes it easier to get at hard-to-reach places. These affordable true wireless buds are packed with features found on top-tier pairs. They work with just about any voice assistant—tapping the left bud activates Google or Alexa; pressing and holding the right headphone prompts Siri or Bixby. And they feature an Ambient Aware mode, which allows the sound of vehicles and friends’ voices to come through without requiring yanking a bud. These are the safest headphones for runners who share the roads with cars. They use bone-conduction technology to send sound waves through cheekbones, without blocking ear canals. The newest model has a slim design that doesn’t vibrate annoyingly at loud volume and a richer, clearer sound than earlier versions. An IP67 rating means they’ll survive a heavy sweat or rainstorm. We love the enormous 22-inch touchscreen display and broad range of coaching options on this high-end machine. Thetreadmilltaps into the iFit programming platform, where you can get guided video lessons from coaches like elite runner Tommy Rivers Puzey or take scenic runs in exotic destinations around the globe. The Vistas are among the smallest pairs oftotally wireless buds, with a tiny magnetic charging case, but pack a generous six hours of run time in a single charge. They’re also remarkably durable, completely sealed from moisture and dust. This full-length mirror is like a big shiny TV that streams a fitness instructor into a living room or home gym for strength training, yoga, and even stretch sessions. Duringour testing, we liked that we could easily see how our form compared to that of the instructor. What sets the Hyperice Hypervolt apart from every other massage gun we’ve tried is its whisper-quiet operation. Even at the highest setting, the Hypervolt doesn’t intrude on conversations or detract from TV watching. Like the Addaday, this update includes Bluetooth functionality, with a smartphone app for following along with recommended treatments. This 24-hour-a-day fitness tracker measures everything the wearer does when not running, monitoring their heart rate and movement all day and night. That data lets the app calculate how much strain their body has absorbed and generates a recovery score that’s easy to understand. Most crucially, it’ll let them know whether they’re really ready for that hard workout or if they should take one more rest day. This little yellow sensor clips to the waistband of shorts—not shoe—and measures the vertical and side-to-side movement during a run. That means it can calculate key form indicators, like how much time the runner spends on each foot (favoring one side too much may lead to injury), and use the data to calculate running power in real time. Pair it with a compatible Garmin watch like the Forerunner 945 or Fenix 6 to get on-the-run access to stride data. The Peloton Tread is gorgeous and performs just as stunningly well—a massive 32-inch touchscreen displays live studio classes. The professional trainers, which are available through a live stream or pre-recorded workouts, make it hard to hold back on easy days. Plus, the slatted running surface feels more realistic than most ’mills, and side-mounted dials make it a breeze to adjust pace or ramp angle. This update to the featherweight, foot-based power meter can now factor in the wind to determine how much energy you’re using during a workout or race. Accelerometers and gyroscopes measure the path of your foot down to the millimeter to measure how many watts you’re putting out. We also appreciated the pod’s month-long battery and Stryd’s PowerCenter website that tracks all our training. For $60 a year, you can purchase a one-year subscription to Strava. The online training log renamed its paid offering (formerly Summit) and has limited a lot of its previously free features to paying members, but there are a lot of reasons to upgrade: Competing on segments, one of the more popular features, is limited to members. Free users can see the top 10 on a leaderboard, but premium users can dig deeper and see where their friends and rivals stand, too. There’s also route planning, goal setting, and more complete analysis of workout data.

How to Truly Know You’re Ready to Exercise Postpartum,"There’s more to it than just getting the okay from your OB. There are a lot of milestones following the birth of a baby: coming home from the hospital, taking photos with the family, the first time theysleepthrough the night (hallelujah!). The milestones aren’t just for your new little one; the standard postpartum check-in with your OB-GYN, which generally happens around six to eight weeks after childbirth, is a turning point for moms too. During this visit, your doc will check your physical and emotionalrecoveryand will likely do a pelvic exam to ensure you’re healing properly (like making sure your uterus is shrinking back to its pre-pregnancy size). If all is good, they’ll clear you forsexandexercise. That’s a big deal for many new moms—especially if you’re arunneritching to get back to racking up the miles. But it doesn’t necessarily mean your body is back to its pre-baby ways and ready for action. When I eased intojogginga couple months after giving birth to my second son, myhip flexorswere super weak and achy. Hoofing it up the neighborhoodhillI run up all the time felt like a totally new experience—and one that I was attempting with jell-o hips. The entire two miles I was out there on the road, I kept wondering,Is this feeling normal? Even though my OB said all clear… is thisactuallyokay? “Each body goes through such unique challenges duringpregnancy, birth, and postpartum,” says Susie Crossland-Dwyer, ultramarathoner, Pilates instructor, and founder ofStudio Sin Cincinnati, who gave birth to her son in 2021 and did a lot of fine-tunedcross-trainingas she was easing back into her mileage. “Getting a professional to evaluate your body and what it needs is crucial to returning to any type of movement practice.” To help you figure out whether you need a little extra TLC whenreturning to your running routine, even if your doc gave the go-ahead, we tapped experts to offer advice. They share how to tune into signs you’re ready for more movement, when to dial it back, plus a handful oftraining tipsto focus on so youcome back stronger than ever. Clearance from your OB might seem momentous, but it’s really just the first step in your return to exercise if you want torun without any achesor pains. Before you go run a few miles, you should check a few other boxes off as well: First, make sure you canwalkthe same distance you want to run with absolutely no problem, says Andrea Yarbrough, D.P.T., orthopedic and pelvic floor expert withthe HOPE Doctorsin Florida. It’s also a good sign if you have zero or very minimalsorenesspost-walk. From there, another good indicator that you’re ready to run is if you can do someinterval trainingcomfortably. We’re not necessarily talkingspeedwork, but rather alternate 1 minute walking with 30 seconds running and work up from there. And if you’re doingstrength trainingto support yourcardio—and doing it all pain-free—you can likely head out for a run knowing you’re prepared. Still pee a little when you laugh or sneeze? Yes, that’s super-common when you’repregnant, but afterward, it can also be a warning sign that yourpelvic floor muscleshave been damaged or weakened and need some extra attention. Other signs that these muscles need work include constipation, excess gas, or pain with sex, says Yarbrough. And if you don’t address the pain orweaknessin thepelvic floorbefore demanding more of your body through exercise, chances are it will just compound the problem. “These issues usually don’t resolve on their own or with time, and I’ve seen them cause other issues within the body—even issues like TMJ pain in the jaw,abnormal gait patterns, andpoor balance,” says Yarbrough. Apelvic floor physical therapistcan help you with these issues by doing a full-body assessment to pinpoint muscular weakness orimbalances, then putting together a plan withmassage,mobility drills, andstrength moves. Other sneaky sensations to watch out for: core fatigue,back pain, and soreness or swelling around any scars (from a C-section or vaginal tearing). Feel any of these and you should do somecross-trainingto support your miles—and maybe also just go easy on yourself. “Anytime I felt these symptoms, I’d back off how many days I was running per week,cut a run short, or just give myself extra rest,” says Crossland-Dwyer. Don’t worry: We’re not giving you extra homework to try to squeeze into your already-busy,sleep-deprivedschedule. Some simple adds and tweaks to your routine are all it takes to make your mileage comfortable. Yarbrough recommends focusing on things like deep breathing,single-leg balance, andglute strength. Try these three techniques whenever you have a few minutes to spare. “This practice doesn’t have to take extra time out of your day and is very effective in re-establishing the right amount of intra-abdominal pressure,” says Crossland-Dwyer. “Also, since thepelvic floorand diaphragm work together, healing happens in tandem.” To do it, place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, just below your ribs.Breathein slowly, letting your belly rise as you inhale (your chest should remain still). Then slowly let your belly collapse as you exhale. Continue for five to 10 minutes. Bonus: “This is such an easy tool to use inearly postpartumwhen life feels overwhelming,” says Crossland-Dwyer, who loved the technique forcalming her nervesso much, she continues to do it atbedtimenearly a year after giving birth to her son. Add some moves like single-legglute bridgesandside planksinto your workouts, suggests Yarbrough. These work deep-core muscles and improve yourstability, which will help keep you strong during the side-to-side motion of running. Focusing on thesestrength-training exercisescan also help toinjury-proof your body, as they fightimbalances. This can help protect your muscles, joints, and ligaments as you add in more impact. Crossland-Dwyer says she couldn’t wait to get back torunning post-baby: “I wasn’t in a rush to berunning longorfastbut I missed the joy, the sweat, and the fatigue of a run.” But to start off, she committed towalkingfor 30 to 60 minutes daily to build back herendurancebefore adding in the impact of running. And then once she began running again, she continued taking frequent walk breaks to ease her body into it. The good news is,walkingis something you can probably start within just a couple weeks of giving birth to your baby. The great news is, you can bring baby in tow in thestrollerand prep for your return to running at once.

And since it’s made from stretchy fabric, it can fit almost any size phone. Just because they don’t have a bathtub doesn’t mean that washing up after a run can’t be therapeutic.

Ultrarunner Camille Herron’s Primary Sponsor Lululemon Drops Her After Wikipedia Scandal,"Herron also holds a volunteer role with USATF, and it is unclear if her position with the governing body of track and field is in jeopardy. This story will be updated. Ultrarunner Camille Herron, who was shown in aSeptember 23Canadian Runningreport to have allegedly made edits to the Wikipedia pages of some of her competitors to downplay their accomplishments, has been dropped by Lululemon, her primary sponsor. In a statement sent toRunner’s World, Lululemon wrote: “We are committed to upholding equitable competition in sport for all and intentionally partner with ambassadors who embody these same values. After careful consideration and conversation, we have decided to end our ambassador partnership with Camille. We want to acknowledge Camille’s achievements during our partnership and wish her well in her future endeavors.” Herron, who did not respond to a text message fromRunner’s World, initially denied the accusations on the social media platform X, before deactivating her accounts on X and Instagram. Her Instagram account has since been restored. The report byCanadian Runningshowed how IP addresses linked to Herron and her husband, Conor Holt, made changes to the pages forCourtney Dauwalterand Kilian Jornet, among others. The report also said Herron “altered the ultramarathon Wikipedia page to remove references to Danish ultrarunner Stine Rex’s48-hour and six-day world records.” Rex ran thesix-day record earlier this month, breaking Herron’s record from March. Rex said in a September 23Facebook post, translated from Danish, that Herron had accused her of cheating during her six-day record and “instead of talking about what achievement I had made, [I] had to defend myself to the Danish and foreign media about why the world’s best female ultrarunner accused me of cheating. She took my joy of victory and made me doubt if I did something wrong.” Holt wrotein an email posted to LetsRunthat he took full responsibility for the edits to Herron’s pages. The email did not explain why the pages of others were edited. Holt did not respond to a text message fromRunner’s World. The couple is currently in Greece so Herron can compete at Spartathlon, a 153-mile ultramarathon. Additionally, Herron is the secretary for the women’s long distance running committee of USA Track & Field (USATF). She is responsible for keeping the minutes of the meetings, a volunteer job that requires accuracy in reporting. A spokesperson for USATF said the organization has no comment at this time. It is unclear whether Herron’s role with the organization going forward will change. The imbroglio has left much of the running community mystified. Herron, 42, has accomplished incredible feats in ultrarunning and has gotten plenty of publicity for them, including coverage in theNew York TimesandWashington Postas well as running-specific publications. She owns the 48-hour record, which sheset in 2023 when she ran 270.5 milesaround a 400-meter track in Bruce, Australia. In March, Herron ran 560.33 miles over six days inFurther, a women’s-only ultra put on by Lululemon. The six-day record, later broken by Rex, was one of 13 records she set during the event. Herron detailed on Instagram the extreme toll that took on her body. Philosopher and ultrarunner Sabrina Little, who is the author of the 2024 bookThe Examined Run: Why Good People Make Better Runners, acknowledged the strangeness of Herron and Holt’s actions in an email toRunner’s World. “We are all humans. Humans make mistakes—sometimes even big, messy, unrepentant mistakes—and our community, myself included, could do a better job balancing justice and grace,” she wrote. “I know that it is difficult to do so on the internet, and it can be captivating to talk about these things and add our own perspectives. But I think we should leave room for a sanctioned person to be restored to the community, or to have some semblance of stability and continuity so they can move productively forward.” Little added that she was not intending to diminish harms or to explain away the bad things that happened. “That would be a mistake,” she wrote. “The goal is not to lower standards. But one bad action (or pattern of bad actions) is not going to be solved with another bad action (gossip).” Editor’s note: This story has been updated to remove Des Linden as one of the athletes whose Wikipedia page was edited.AlthoughCanadian Runningreported that Linden’s page was edited, there is no evidence of that.

"2,189 Miles, 40 Days, and 3 Showers: How Tara Dower Destroyed the Appalachian Trail Speed Record","Fueled by 90-second “dirt naps” and the “La La Land” soundtrack, she beat Karel Sabbe's record by 13 hours. Minutes before midnight on Saturday evening, Tara Dower emerged from the forest on Springer Mountain in Blue Ridge, Georgia. Trudging through the darkness, the 31-year-old wore a headlamp to navigate the last section of theAppalachian Trail—a beacon in the homestretch of a legendary journey. With thousands of miles behind her, Dower fell to her knees and put her hands on the finish, a bronze plaque that reads, “A footpath for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness.” On September 21, Dower became the fastest person in history to complete the Appalachian Trail, a 2,189-mile path that traverses Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. The professional ultrarunner, who lives and trains in Virginia Beach, Virginia, covered the trail heading southbound in 40 days, 18 hours, and five minutes, the fastest known time (FKT), pending verification. She beat the previous overall record by 13 hours. Prior to Dower’s trek, the fastest known time was held byKarel Sabbe. Heading northbound, the Belgian runner finished the trail in 41 days, 7 hours, and 38 minutes in 2018. Dower’s performance also returns the FKT distinction to a woman for the first time since 2015, when Scott JurekeclipsedJennifer Pharr Davis’ then-record by three hours, according toOutside. “This isn’t my FKT,” Dower toldRunner’s Worldon a phone call in between naps on Monday morning. “It’s not just mine because without the crew, I would not have done it.” While navigating notoriously difficult sections on rocky terrain with a total vertical gain of 465,000 feet, Dower ran and hiked an average of 54 miles each day with consistent support from her mom, Debby Komlo, and friend Megan Wilmarth, in addition to volunteers who paced her through different sections. Her days began with a 3 a.m. alarm (usually from a tent close to the trail) followed by a quick breakfast. After tapingblistersand sores on her feet, she set off in the dark around 3:30 a.m. For the next 17 hours or so, Dower only stopped for a couple of short breaks for meals, 90-second “dirt naps,” and pacers rotating in and out until 8:30-9:30 p.m. Dower estimated she only ran solo for 20 percent of the time. When she did, she listened to audiobooks and movie soundtracks, likeLa La LandandMoulin Rouge, often singing to herself to stay awake. Dower and her crew were so focused on time efficiency and staying close to the trail, she only took three showers throughout the entire thru-hike. Instead, they relied on baby wipes, clean clothes, and friends to help detangle her hair. “There was a time when I was itching my skin and clumps of dirt and Icy Hot were under my nails. I was like, this is really gross,” she said. Though she got off to a strong start, Dower had to summon extra strength in the second half to match the pace set by Sabbe. On the section of the trail that hits New Jersey, Dower and her crew realized she was falling behind by 100 miles or so and decided to increase her daily mileage from 43-54 to 55-60. In tough moments, Wilmarth reminded her friend that she’s capable. “Tara is really good at doing hard things, and that’s what I would tell her this whole time,” she said. In the last 129 miles, with the FKT well within reach, Dower didn’t even stop to sleep. That last stretch proved to be the hardest physically and mentally. “I had this huge crew that was with me that was putting everything into this, their time and money, and bodies into this effort. I was nervous I would fall and mess it up,” Dower said while describing how she bounced back from several tumbles on the trail. “I didn’t believe [the FKT] would happen until the last three miles.” To help distract her, Dower asked her pacers to talk to her about anything other than the record. Together, they shared stories of their favorite moments on the trip, including the breathtaking sunsets in Virginia and wildlife they encountered. With one mile to go, Dower went from feeling worried to grateful—for the crew who helped guide her and the experience of doing something unprecedented. “That last mile was pretty special,” Wilmarth said. “You could just tell she was zoned in and focused.” For Dower, the record also signifies redemption in many ways. Seven years ago, she was eight days into her first thru-hike attempt on the Appalachian Trail when she suffered from a panic attack. A novice to long-distance hiking at the time, the former college rugby player was forced to end her hike early and confront her anxiety. In the years that followed, she worked on understanding the condition and found ways of coping with it. Dower put more effort into building a community of friends on the trails. She also adjusted her perspective ongoal setting. Instead of feeling overwhelmed with reaching the final destination, she started to set smaller benchmark goals that lead up to a big goal. Two years later, Dower returned with her husband and completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail going northbound in five months and 10 days. “I really loved that experience,” she said. “I really felt like I was meant to hike the trail in 2019.” Dower, who shares her ultra running and thru-hiking feats on her YouTube channel, announced her FKT attempt in January. In ashort video, she said, “I’m all about the challenges. I always want to challenge myself … and number two, it just felt like I was being called to the trail again.” Dower said learning from thru-hiking legends, including previous record-holder Pharr Davis, helped inspire her record attempt this summer. She also used the Appalachian Trail FKT as a fundraising opportunity for Girls on the Run, a nonprofit organization that hosts running programs for girls around the country. Since taking off from the start at Katahdin Mountain in Maine, she’sraised over $24,000far surpassing her goal of $20,000. (Donations are still open.) In addition to the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail, the Appalachian Trail is considered one of the “Big 3” national scenic trails, according to theFastest Known Time website, the organization that tracks and verifies thru-hike attempts. The Appalachian Trail record is just the latest impressive result Dower has achieved in a steady rise through the sport. Since 2020, she’s completednine 100-mile racesandbroken five FKTs. In August 2023, shecrushed the longstanding Colorado Trail women’s supported FKT, traversing the 567 miles from Denver to Durango in 8 days, 21 hours, and 59 minutes. In July, she finished fourth in the women’s field at the Hardrock 100 one month before beginning her long journey across the east coast on August 12. Less than 48 hours after achieving the Appalachian Trail FKT, Dower said she hopes the team effort inspires women and girls, just as she was inspired by the women who broke barriers before her. “I hope more women get out there,” Dower said. “It’s not about beating men, it’s about finding our true potential. And, you know, if you beat the men, that’s an extra bonus.” Taylor Dutch is a writer and editor living in Austin, Texas, and a former NCAA track athlete who specializes in fitness, wellness, and endurance sports coverage.

What is a Hut-to-Hut Running Adventure and How Do You Plan One?,"Historic hut systems around the world are simple sanctuaries to stay overnight and extend your miles. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Ripples flowed across the surface of Vista Lake while the arms of pine trees danced in every direction. The helicopter’s high-pitched hum and rapidwhoomph-whoomph-whoomphof the rotors roared overhead as we landed. Our crew of ninetrail runnerswas being heli-taxied to one of four off-grid huts speckling the Esplanade Range of British Columbia’s Selkirk Mountains in Canada. After the Vista Hut drop off, the pilot would shuttle our overnight bags to Meadow and Sunrise Lodges, where we’d venture next. The four solar-powered shelters, owned byGolden Alpine Holidays (a tour company), are only 7 miles apart north-to-south, but require travel by foot up grassy slopes and rocky ridgelines between each one. And they also sit at nearly 7,000 feet above sea level. For the next five days, this remote region was home for me and those with me: 50,000 acres to explore via singletrack, rocky ridgelines, and sparkling turquoise tarns. We were excited to experience this special place with the added luxury of well-sheltered, well-fed overnights—plus wood-firedsauna sessions—all at the huts. I first learned about hut-to-hut trail running trips through word of mouth, specifically the annual summer hut-to-hut trip launched and led by professionalultrarunner Rickey Gates. Growing up and living in the mountains of Southwest Colorado, historic huts have been a common sight onhikesI did with my family but only after hearing about Gates’ trip did I realize they could be used fortrail running trips, too. Later, I received a couple of invitations from trail runners to join hut trips, both catered and completely self-supported, opening up a new world of traveling through incredible terrain and locations. The trips sound dreamy just reading about, right? If you want to plan your own hut-to-hut running adventure (not all are only accessible by helicopter—many by foot), here’s how to make the most of your time in the backcountry. Simply put, a hut-to-hut run trip means you stay overnight in a hut (or multiple huts) while “seeing a route, location or mountain range byrunning,” saysRuncation Travelfounder Liz Gill, a USATF-certified run coach and hut-to-hut running guide. Founded in 2017, Gill’s company provides guided and self-led itineraries, including trips through the Dolomites of Italy and Slovenia and along the Tour du Mont Blanc (in Italy, Switzerland, and France, spanning 106 miles in total). Recently, Gill also launched acamp-to-camp glamping run tripin Machu Picchu, Peru. Join Runner's World+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners Hut-to-hut routes can be a point-to-point path or circuit of any distance with one or more overnight shelters. For tighter timelines, you could also run an out-and-back to a single hut (good if you want just one night in the backcountry). Yourrun routeto, from, or around the huts may include segments of singletrack, pavement, doublewide dirt service roads, or no trail at all—just scrambling across boulder fields. Generally, hut systems are accessible by foot or helicopter. However, some of the huts along particular routes, such as those along theTour du Mont Blanc, are located in villages or towns with road access. Some hut systems, such as thehütten,as they’re known in the Eastern Alps, are nearly150 years oldwhile others, like a portion of Colorado’s famed10th Mountain Division Hut Associationhut system, were builtin the 1950s, and a handful of bungalows offer more modern escapes. Certain hut trips, like mine in the Esplanade Range, are basically located in the middle of nowhere while others link up villages. Historically, huts around the world have served as shelters for soldiers, sheepherders, U.S. Forest Service patrol or other guards,ski mountaineers, and foot travelers, to name a few. Today, many of these still-standing structures are available for recreational enjoyment. Also known asrifugios,or mountain refuges, in Italy,refugiosin Argentina and Spain, andgîtesin France, each one “can be quite different from another depending on the location and country. Rifugios can have private rooms with three-course meals and others are a simple shelter,” says Gill. With those simple shelters, you get a bed, perhaps kitchen utensils and books for leisure reading—and that’s about it. Start by choosing an area of the country or abroad that you want to travel to, suggests Gill, pointing toThe Mountain Hut Book, one of her primary inspirations, in addition toThe Tour of Mont Blanc. Once you decide where you want to go, you can also research online to find a guidebook that details the huts in that place. Commercialized huts will have contact info, overnight rates, and potentially reservation guidelines all online. As you research, also consider tracking down popular ski hut or hiking hut routes, because often those huts can not only be utilized for skiing and hiking but also be a good fit fortrail runningtrips in the summer months. Next, “use a mapping service likeFatmapandGaia GPSto plot a route, marking huts along the way. Create a plan B and a bail out for if the conditions aren’t right. For instance, I’ve hit waytoo much snowto cross, had to go back and then go around a different way,” says Gill. Be sure to considerelevation gainand loss in addition todistance, so that you don’t bite off more ground than you feel comfortable. Lately, huts are in growing demand for various adventurers, so book well in advance. “Popular huts can often book out by November for the following summer. Start early or look atoff-seasondates like late August or early September. There are plenty of lesser-known huts that are not along the most popularlong-distance trails, like the Tour du Mont Blanc, that you can use for spur of the moment trips,” says Gill. For example, Colorado Parks & WildlifeState Foresthuts,Maine Huts & Trailshut system, or the huts of theAppalachian Mountain Clubin the Northeast are all lesser known options. To learn more about hut systems in the United States,Hut to Hut USAis a full-scope resource. As the book outlines, there are nearly sixteen hut systems across 14 states, mostly concentrated on the coasts. Less trafficked, more primitive huts often have smaller fees or none at all. For instance, an undeveloped hut run trip I took with friends cost $10 total (one night for my food), because we didn’t need to pay for one of the huts where we stayed. Other huts can cost over $100 per night, and require booking ahead. This cost varies depending on the country, travel season, provided amenities, and whether or not you coordinate with a travel guide, private backcountry chef, or hire a certifiedmountain running guide. If you do decide to hire a guide for your trip, check their certifications and experience. “It’s great to look for guides with certifications, which differs country to country, or at a minimum, extensive experience in the area. In some countries the certification is a ‘middle mountain’ guide that leads trails for running andhikingversus a high mountain guide, which is a more expensive service,” explains Gill. For example, Gill has Wilderness First Aid, Sports First Aid, and CPR certifications. At a high mountain guide level, James Madden, co-owner ofCanadian Rockies Running Adventures, which offers overnight run trips with huts and camps, is a double-certifiedIFMGAandACMGMountain Guide, alongside co-owner Emily Compton, an ACMGApprentice Hiking Guide. How and what you pack is influenced by the type of hut you visit. “Choosing staffed huts with a kitchen where the food and bedding is provided lends itself well to running, so that you can pack less and there are fewer logistics to organize regarding hiring a chef,” says Gill. Otherwise, “You could carry an ultralight stove and bring your food or hire someone to hike in the linens and food to cook for you,” says Gill. Some hut systems offer a package with extra services for groups, such as the guided and catered options.Trail runnerscan also reach out to pack animal companies, outfitters, and backcountry chefs in their region of travel to inquire about the services and group packages they offer. Minimalists or budgeted travelers carry all of their belongings in theirtrail running pack. “Don’t skip on safety items, such as a satellite phone and a miniature first aid kit with essentials such as anti-histamines for insect bites and antiseptics to clean out scrapes from a fall. You can leave out creature comforts like multiple toiletry products. Instead, use an all-in-one soap versus multiple products for the face, hair, and body. When you’re running, every pound makes a difference versus when you’rebackpacking, you might not feel each ounce as much. You want your pack as light as possible,” she says. Gill’s pack necessities include a first aid kit, satellite phone or cell phone, and a map. In some locations, you’ll also want bear spray and bug repellent.Sunglasses, a hat,sunscreenand chapstick with SPF protection is key, as well as a water filtration system, whether you’re in the backcountry or running through towns. Gill also carries arain jacket, wind layer such as thePatagonia Houdini, lightweight puffy, change of underwear and socks, one extra t-shirt, leggings, toothpaste, a mini toothbrush, and phone or satellite device charger if electricity or solar-generated power is available. Another option: Hire a shuttle driver that transports your baggage to each hut by vehicle, pack animal, or helicopter—like my trip in the Esplanade Range—depending on the hut’s remoteness and accessibility. For primitive hut systems, friends and I have also backpacked our food and sleeping gear between remote mountain shacks, which each served as our basecamp for dailymountain runs. This women’s pack has two soft bladders and plenty of additional pockets and pouches. Though it doesn’t come with bottles, this backpack can hold a water reservoir as well as extra gear you may need out on the trail. Have easy access to all your essentials on long runs or races with Nathan’s lightweight running vest. An affordable hydration vest complete with two soft flasks and other minimal storage needs. From exploration to solitude totime in nature, enjoying fitness,stress reliefandmeditation, laughs, or camaraderie on the trail, all of the aspects that most athletes love about trail running is amplified in-depth on back-to-back days. Plus, running farther offers you an opportunity to see terrain you’d never otherwise experience: deep backcountry wilderness areas that typically can’t be accessed by road. As a result, these places are also more secluded and untouched. “When you’re running hut to hut over several days, you can see the ins and outs of the trail and of a place, especially along a mountain route that crosses through countries or along a border where you see the food, language, and culture change day to day, in addition to the scenery,” says Gill. Hut-to-hut run adventures can also be a fun way to connect with new or established friends ortrain for an endurance eventin addition to seeing new terrain. A handful of the most idyllic huts to consider visiting include California’sSierra Club Lodges and Huts,Clair Tappaan Lodge Backcountry Hutsin California, and the cabins and yurts of theAlaska Huts Association, says Gill. You could also add theSan Juan Hutsin southwest Colorado, theMaine Huts & Trailscollection, and thehutsof the Appalachian Mountain Club in New Hampshire to your list. Also check out theRendezvous Hutsin Washington, the yurts of Idaho-basedSun Valley Mountain Huts, or theBoundary Country Trekkingyurt and bed and breakfast-style cabins in Minnesota. Internationally, “Patagonia’s refugio circuits in El Bolsón, Bariloche, and El Chaltén—which hand-make pizza or brew their own beer—are really fun and bedding is provided,” adds Gill and says, “I have a personal preference for Italian rifugios—they’re really amazing.” Sometimes, it’s easier, less stressful, and safer—say, if you’re not experienced with remote navigation or risk management—to book a trip with arun travel companythat has a pre-dialed program, especially in an unfamiliar or international location. As mentioned, Rickey Gates offers theHut Run Hut, a six-day mountain running adventure along huts in Colorado’s 10th Mountain Division Hut Association. My five-day Esplanade Range trip was organized byRetreat Goldenand included a backcountry chef, so I didn’t need to pre-plan my meals yet enjoyed flavorful, nutritious food. Alternatively, you could stay posted at a single hut for a less complex trip. In that realm, try the4-day CMH Summer Adventures Guided Alpine Trail Runningfeaturing back-to-back stays at the isolated Bugaboo Lodge with helicopter bumps to mountain run each day in the surrounding iconic Bugaboo Mountains, Canada. Similarly,Canadian Rockies Running Adventuresoffers a Rogers Pass Weekend run trip based out of Wheeler Hut. “Any hut that is relatively remote with a mountain view is going to be an incredible experience,” Gill says. The key is just planning ahead so you know what you’re in for in the backcountry. Morgan Tilton writes about the outdoors with a focus on travel, industry news, and human endurance.

How to Make Running With a Water Bottle Easier,"Staying hydrated is a must on long runs. Use these tips to make it simple to stash your H2O. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? In the last few weeks, temperatures have reached record highs across the country, which forced many of us to adjust torunning in the heat. One must-have to handling these high temperatures? Stayinghydrated, which means running with a water bottle or other hydration gear. “Most runners strategically pick theirclothes,sneakers, andtraining plans, but have no plan for staying hydrated,” says Craig Horswill, Ph.D., clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, adding—no surprise here—that this is a problem. On the light end of the spectrum,dehydrationcan cause aheadacheand screw up your run, and on the severe side, it can lead toheat stroke, which can be deadly. We know carrying water in addition to everything else isn’t always ideal or the most comfortable, but it doesn’t have to be complicated and it can even make your runs better. Here are three ways to comfortably run with a water bottle. Some coaches argue that ahandheld bottlewill throw off your weight and thus your form. But two small handhelds (one in each hand for even weight distribution) makes for a smart option for shorterlong runs. “A simple handheld will do the trick for shorter runs less than two hours long,” says Patrick Caron, an ultrarunner who holds the record for fastest 100 miles run by a 19- and 20-year-old. “Flasks are great because they’re there when you need them, and you can stash them when you don’t,” Caron says. If you only want to run with one water bottle, pass it back and forth between hands each mile—it’ll prevent you from developingimbalancesand give you something to focus on as the miles tick by. If you prefer to stow your necessities on your waist, a lumbar pack (which sits around your hips) or belt can help you stay hydrated on both road andtrail. Placing the weight of water on the small of your back, in the center, is the best place to distribute that weight without throwing offyour form. Plus, packs have room to stow your fluids and otherfuelor gear you may need such asgels,snacks, orsunscreen. If bottles and belts aren’t your jam, try arunning vest, which is popular among trail andultrarunners. A vest works similar to abackpackin that it evenly distributes the weight on and around your core. Running hydration vests are also super streamlined to stay close to the body, just be sure to test yours out on some shorter runs first to make sure there are no issues withchafing. Determining yourhydration planis both complicated and simple. “Everyone requires different amounts of water during their run,” Horswill says. But it’s easy to figure out how much you need with one key strategy. First, weigh yourself nude rightbefore a run. Next, run around your race pace for one hour, keeping track of how much you drink (in ounces) during the run. (If it’s during the summer, hopefully you’re drinking something!) After the run, strip down, towel off any sweat, and weigh yourself nude again. Subtract your weight from your prerun weight and convert to ounces. (One pound equals 16 ounces.) Then add to that number with however many ounces of liquid you consumed on your run. For example, if you lost a pound and drank 16 ounces of fluid, your total fluid loss is 32 fluid ounces. To determine how much you should be drinking about every 15 minutes, divide your hourly fluid loss by four (in the above example it would be 8 fluid ounces). Because the test only determines your sweat losses for the environmental conditions you run in that day, you should retest on another day when conditions are different to see how your sweat rate is affected. You should also redo the test during different seasons, in different environments (such as higher or loweraltitudes), and as you becomefaster, as pace also affects yoursweat rate. Horswill also warns againstover-hydrating, which can be fatal in extreme cases, so you shouldn’t weighmorethan your starting weight when you come back. Do this test periodically throughout the year since your hydration needs will change based on the season and how well you’ve acclimated to the heat. (Find some estimates based on your weight with thishydration chart by weight.) Understanding your personal sweat rate is important because loading up on water all at once isn’t the besthydration strategy. “The idea is to replace sweat as you lose it, plus a belly full of fluid isn’t very comfortable,” Horswill says.

Could Women Be Hardwired for Endurance Events?,"In an excerpt fromUp to Speed, author Christine Yu examines what we know about female physiology—and why more science on sex differences in sport is so important. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? If there’s one person who fits the mold for a textbook endurance athlete, it might be ultrarunnerCamille Herron. You can’t miss her tall frame in races on the roads or thetrails. She’s usually at the front of the pack, her blond hair hanging loose around her shoulders. While her competitors may be grimacing, Herron is most likely smiling. She just looks like she’s having fun—like there’s nothing she’d rather do than log mile after mile after mile. Herron says she was born to run and her talent for long footraces has resulted in multiple American and world records, from 50-mile races to events that spanned 24 hours, world championship titles, and outright wins against all competitors. She even holds the Guinness World Record for thefastest marathonrun by a woman in a superhero costume (she dressed as Spider-Man). What makes Herron so good atultrarunningis largely her physiology and, more specifically, her aerobic capacity. Her body is primed for high-volume training. In grad school, herVO2maxwas measured in the high 60s, a level that indicates she has a pretty big aerobic engine. VO2max is a proxy for the maximum amount of oxygen you’re able to take up and pump to your muscles and is one of the three factors that does a pretty good job of predicting performance in endurance sports. While Herron hasn’t had her muscles biopsied, she says she believes she’s made up of “probably like 99 percent slow-twitch”muscle fibers—the ones that power athletes through long, steady-state exercise and are less prone to muscular fatigue. Unsurprisingly, the ability to withstand fatigue can be a pivotal factor in whether an athlete crosses the finish line. And women, on average, tend to have a greater distribution of slow-twitch, or type I, muscle fibers. On the whole, these fibers are suffused with capillaries, the tiny blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood. They have moremitochondriatoo, the cell’s energy powerhouse. That means slow-twitch fibers have everything they need to keep going and going…and going. Men, on the other hand, have a greater proportion of fast-twitch or type II fibers, which are better suited for speed and powerful bursts of movement, in part explaining men’s historic dominance in traditional sports. But with a lower concentration of capillaries and mitochondria, these muscle fibers also tucker out faster. Sandra Hunter, director of the Athletic and Human Performance Research Center at Marquette University, has spent the better part of the last 20 years studying muscle function in women and creating models to explain why muscles are susceptible tofatigue. In the lab, she has observed that women tire less quickly during specific kinds of exercise. For example, she asked women and men volunteers to perform intermittent, static muscle contractions—repeatedly engaging their arm muscles at 50 percent of their maximum strength for six seconds, then resting for four seconds, until they were exhausted. The men quit the steady-state activity after an average of 8.5 minutes while the women lasted approximately 23.5 minutes—nearly three times longer. Hunter says the discrepancies aren’t due to a person’s motivation or ability to activate their muscles. Instead, she says it comes down to the distinct composition of muscle fibers, and women have fibers that don’t fatigue as fast. But Hunter says the greater muscle mass and muscle fiber diameter found in men might play a role too. When these stronger muscles are engaged, they might exert more pressure inside the muscle. The rise in internal pressure could restrict or cut off blood flow and oxygen, which would cause the muscle to tire quickly. Other studies in the field have found that women accumulated less waste product and bloodlactatein their muscles, which may also contribute to their ability to withstand fatigue. While interesting, these findings don’t really tell us much about what might happen in the real world. In 2012, a team of Canadian and French researchers set out to determine if women were still more resistant to fatigue after an actual ultra-endurance exercise session. They recruited 10 men and 10 women who were participating in theUltra-Trail du Mont-Blanc(UTMB) in the Alps, the Super Bowl of the ultrarunning world. After the 110-kilometer race (the normally 171-kilometer course was shortened due to wintery conditions), the muscles in the men’s calves and thighs were more exhausted compared to the women. The finding confirmed what Hunter saw in her lab: Women tire less than men after long, steady-state physical activity. Aerobic capacity andmuscle enduranceare only part of the physiology puzzle. Another key factor in an athlete’s success is how well their body usescarbohydratesandfatfor fuel. While carbohydrates are a readily available source of energy for most activities, the body simply can’t store enough carbs to keep an athlete going for extended periods of time. At some point, it must turn to fat to power working muscles, and the ability to burn fat efficiently matters in ultra-endurance sports. Herron has a preternatural awareness of her body’s energy andhydration needs, rarely dipping into a depleted state where her body is using more energy than she’s taking in. While most people weigh less after a race because of the number of calories they expend and water weight lost through sweat, Herron says she often weights the same, even after a 24-hour race. She’s never skipped her period either, a critical marker of hormonal and bone health linked toadequate nutrition. Herron thinks it’s partly because her body is “probably wired for fat metabolism.” If an athlete is more adept at accessing and burning fat, their body may be better primed to sustain longer bouts ofaerobic exercisebecause, theoretically, they won’t run out of gas as quickly. Fat, with its greater energy density, offers a bigger bang for the buck compared to carbohydrates. Evidence suggests that women are more metabolically nimble, capable of switching from burning carbohydrates to burning fat, especially during the second half of themenstrual cycle. It turns out that women have more of a specific enzyme needed to facilitate the breakdown of long and medium fatty acid chains. Compared to men, women break down and metabolize fat at a rate that’s up to 56 percent greater over a 24-hour period, regardless of physical activity level. Even at submaximal efforts typical of endurance events, some research suggests that men use as much as 25 percent more of their stored carbohydrates. Nicholas Tiller, an exercise physiologist who studies how the body responds to extremeendurance exerciseand an ultramarathon runner himself, says this ability to utilize fat efficiently has “knock-on implications.” To keep moving forward, ultra-athletes must keep their bodies regularly topped off with calories. Overall, women ultra-athletes don’t need to take in as many calories compared to men because of their smaller body mass. By not ingesting as much food, gels, bars, and sports drinks, women potentially dodge a bullet when it comes to meddlesomegastrointestinal issueslike cramping, vomiting,nausea, loose stools, and bloating, which are frequently cited as one of the top two reasons athletes drop out of a race or don’t perform as well as expected. Plus, if an athlete utilizes fat for energy, like women seem to do, they can reduce the risk of glycogen depletion—when they’ve used up their critical stores of carbohydrates and hit the dreaded “wall.” Both Hunter and Tiller caution that when it comes to sex-based differences in endurance sports, more research is needed. It’s an area of study that scientists continue to tease apart. While some studies show a definitive effect, others report no significant findings. In part, it’s because carrying out research on endurance sports, particularly with women athletes, is hard. For studies conducted in laboratories, scientists often default to men as participants due to factors like the complications (and costs) related to controlling for the menstrual cycle. With field studies, scientists have a hard time getting people to participate in general. “They’ve been training all year for one race. They don’t want to potentially compromise or sacrifice their race performance to help out someone who’s doing some research,” Tiller says. Lower participation rates of women in races make it even harder to recruit these athletes. With fewer (or no) women taking part in studies, scientists can’t examine direct sex differences. Since ultra-races often take place on high-alpine trails, in desert landscapes, and on other difficult terrain, scientists must consider the event’s locations and logistics—and how that might affect data collection. If races occur in remote environments, it could be anywhere from an hour to a day or more for athletes to travel from the finish line to a lab. “At that point, there’s no point taking any measurements because any of the acute, short-term effects are going to have worn off. You need to take these measurements as close to the finish line as possible,” Tiller says. In his studies, Tiller has done everything from camping out in the field for 10 days to conducting tests with athletes in the back of a bus while traveling from the finish line back to base camp. He laughs as he describes what’s supposed to be high-level scientific research. It also influences the type of measurements scientists can collect in the field. It’s relatively easy to measure blood pressure andheart rate, take blood samples, and performbreathingtests. However, he says, these are superficial tests and “none of this is giving us a lot of information about how the body is responding” like CT scans might provide. While there are some compelling reasons for women’s success in ultra-endurance activities, researchers are still on the hunt for the X factor. As physiological advantages begin to fade away withlonger distances, athletes say the psychology of sports and mental stamina begins to take on more importance. It’s clear that endurance is far from straightforward. There is a complex array of factors, and at times it can feel like you’re shuffling a card deck, hoping you’re dealt a winning hand on race day. But what research and athletes themselves continue to discover is that a winning hand doesn’t look the same for women and men, especially for extreme distance events. Those winning hands may include a wider, more varied combination of cards. In the case of women, they may even include cards from the discard pile that no one thought to consider before. When we start to expand the model of athletic performance beyond the traditional male framework, we add more cards to the deck, reframing what is possible for all people.

A Runner’s Mindset: Pushing Up the Mountain,"For Hema Lochan, running is an uphill climb that we’re all ascending together. Every runner has their own unique mindset. In partnership withBrooks,Runner’s Worldis highlighting the different ways that running influences how we experience the world around us and view our place within it.Below, NYC-based runner Hema Lochan shares how they view running as a mountain climb toward a beautiful summit worth sharing.Wherever you want your mind to go—whether it’s a headspace, a feeling, or a finish line—let’s run there. Hema Lochan, a New York-based ultramarathon runner, running coach, and environmental-justice lawyer, sees every run as a mountain. You’re sweating, your calves ache, your heart pounds, and you might want to turn back…but you’re not alone. “If my running mindset were a physical place, it would be an uphill trail leading to a beautiful viewpoint on a mountain surrounded by all the folks I’ve met through running,” Lochan says. “It isn’t always easy, and there are moments when I’ve wanted to give up on it. But in those moments I’ve relied on my running community to push me forward to reach the top of the climb.” First drawn to the sport for the community it provided, Lochan now makes it their mission to foster inclusive running spaces for runners from all backgrounds withGame Changers, an organization that, with support fromBrooks, brings women of color together to become certified running coaches. And through this, Lochan nurtures their own well-being and maintains the energy they need to take each step further up that mountain, one run at a time. “I think I fell in love with the community aspect of running before I fell in love with running itself,” Lochan says. They recall wanting to be part of their high school cross-country team, but the idea of running more than 100 miles in a single race—an act that would later become a foundational part of their life as an ultramarathoner—seemed patently impossible. “The tryout was literally just to walk or run a mile. Like, a singular mile,” they say with a laugh. “I couldn’t do it.” But even then Lochan demonstrated the persistence they’d later come to rely on as an ultramarathon runner. “I got home and I emailed the cross-country coach,” they say. “I was like, ‘Listen, if you take me on, I will be super-committed. I will come to every practice. I just really want to be part of the team.’” The coach gave them a chance, and eventually Lochan fell in love with the sport of long-distance running. “Along with being my connection to a community, running became my connection to my own body and story,” they say. By the time they were in college, Lochan was frequently running marathons (they have now tallied 32 completed races to date). Wanting to push themselves even further, they began signing up for ultra marathons. During one of their first ultras, they had an experience that altered their mindset about both runningandtheir career. This epiphanic moment occurred, as is so often the case, in the middle of a grueling race. “My ankles were killing me,” Lochan says of their experience on that 2018 ultra, which spanned six days and 120 miles. They were alone, trekking up the steep slope of a mountain trail. “I just remember seeing the clearing ahead, and the viewpoint. Once I got up, it was just me and the mountain, and I felt this beautiful sense of peace and gratitude.” In this meditative moment, Lochan’s love for community was brought into focus—and directed toward action. “Things connected,” they say. “I thought,Wow, this makes me love running and love the trails, and makes me want to make sure that the trails are protected for a long time, so other people get to do this.” Their realization on top of that mountain led them to specializing in environmental justice in their career as a lawyer, but that wasn’t all. They wanted to commit more deeply to the running community that they had cultivated through their daily runs by building and supporting inclusive spaces for runners. “I always associated running with feeling safe and feeling seen and being welcomed into a space, because I had that experience in high school, which was primarily people of color,” they say. “I never felt out of place on my team.” But in the years after high school, they began to realize that this wasn’t always the case. “I remember there were moments where I’d look around the starting line and see not a lot of diversity,” they say. “I could count the number of folks who were BIPOC on my hand.” Especially given the importance that community had taken on for them, they felt something had to change. Seeking to embrace a leadership role, Hema joinedGame Changers, which mentors potential coaches from BIPOC communities and provides funding for the coaching certification process. In 2022, Lochan became a coach themselves—a transformative moment on their running journey. “Now that I’m leading and organizing runs, my mindset is about checking in on everyone else,” Lochan says. “Whether I’m leading trail runs or teaching fundamentals of running, making sure everyone feels welcome in this space is always my center.” They glow as they discuss not only their own achievements, but the feeling of shared success in showing others that there’s an inclusive community where they can run and feel supported. “That’s what remains beautiful to me, even when I can’t pull myself out of my negative thoughts. I remember what this person got through or that person got through through running. And that reminds me that I can get through today,” they say—another step up the mountain.

The Most Important Things to Remember When Going From Roads to Trails,"You’ll be ripping over rocks and mud like a mountain goat in no time. Getting off the road is a great way for any runner to deepen their love of the sport. But taking that first step to the trails can be an intimidating prospect to those who are used to strictly running on roads or paved trails. Trail running doesn’t have to mean bushwhacking your way to a mountain summit, though. “People don’t realize how accessible trails are,” says adaptive athlete andMerrellambassadorDan Kosick. “A trail can be the gravel path at the park down the road, just three steps off the sidewalk, or a more secluded, wilderness route.” And those trails come with benefits: softer terrain that’s more forgiving on the joints than roads, varying surfaces that force you to change speeds and activate different muscle areas, and space to let the mind wander. Learn more about trail running “Spending time in nature, engaging my body in movement that connects me with the earth, and doing the thing that makes me feel most human can be really life-altering and affirming,” saysMirna Valerio, an ultrarunner, cross-country coach, and Merrell ambassador. “That is what brings me back to trails, every time.” We asked Kosick and Valerio for their advice to runners who want to confidently and safely start running on trails. Invest in trail shoes Kosick advises against simply wearing your road running shoes on technical trails—at least shoes designed for going fast on pavement, with very thin tread. “If you have insufficient traction or protection for your feet, that’s going to make it 10 times harder and create a miserable experience,” he says. Look for a pair that will work for most of the terrain you plan to hit: Some road shoes will work fine on buffed trails and fire roads. For trails with rocks and roots, you’ll need a little more heft. Shoes for those runs should be comfortable, protect your feet from rocks and other hazards, and have grippy lugs to grab rocks and dirt and help you stay upright in sloppy conditions. Choose a waterproof pair if you plan to run somewhere that’s typically wet or muddy. Roads are convenient: lace up, walk out the door, go. Trails require more planning, particularly if you expect to be away from home longer than a typical road run. Check the hourly weather before you leave the house so you don’t get caught unprepared in a hail storm less than half a mile from home, like Valerio once did. Regarding preparation, Valerio’s other advice is to research and map your route in advance using an app like AllTrails. “Is it a technical trail? Will it be muddy? Will there be scree [loose rocks on the mountainside]?” Those things will affect how you gear up, Valerio says. Lastly, tell someone your route and your expected return time—if they don’t hear from you, they’ll know when to alert someone and where to send them. In general, you want to opt for smart, technical layers. A waterproof rain jacket, wind shell, or thermal layer will become staples.  For colder weather, wear something like a light vest with some storage space in it. “On a mountain, weather can change at less than a moment’s notice,” says Valerio. Not having the right gear can be uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst. “A lot of people don’t realize how hard they’re working, even when they’re just power hiking up a hill, and then they overheat because they don’t have a plan to shed layers,” says Kosick. You should never have that problem—nowadays, you can get outerwear that weighs mere ounces and folds up smaller than a water bottle. If you plan to climb a lot of hills and mountains, it might be a smart idea to invest in some trekking poles specific to trail running. “On a long run, they can help with leg fatigue by sharing the effort throughout your upper body,” says Valerio. Heading out of civilization? Always bring food and water, says Valerio—even if you’re planning on a shorter run. You’ll be thankful for them if you get lost or your route turns out to be longer than anticipated. And unless you’re absolutely sure you won’t be out past dark, bring a headlamp, she adds. Some road runners prefer to leave their phone at home, but on a trail, it can be your lifeline. If you’re taking an unfamiliar route, make sure to have the map downloaded before you lose service. All of these items are going to make your trail run a less stressful, more enjoyable experience. This can be tough for road-to-trail transitioners to grasp, but slowing down is okay! On the road, if you want to up the intensity, you push the pace. But on the trails, every run has an inherent intensity—engaging small stabilizer muscles as you steady yourself on undulating terrain, squeezing those glutes on steep uphills, and trashing your quads on those rollercoaster-like downhills. Plus, there are more potential obstacles. You kind of have to slow down for a fallen tree or family of deer in your path. So don’t beat yourself up if you have to walk uphill, or judge your performance negatively because your trail run paces are slower than on the roads. They are completely different forms of running. No looking up the road for the next checkpoint here. On trails, you should fix your gaze three to four feet ahead so you can react to whatever rocks and roots come at you. Be ready to skip, weave, and move in different directions without warning to dodge those obstructions, Valerio says. Think light on your feet, like a ballerina. “The more hesitant or tight you are because you’re afraid of tripping, the more likely that is to happen. The more confident and loose you can be, the easier you’ll flow over the terrain and when youdotrip (it’s inevitable), you’ll recover easier.” The unpredictable nature of trails also makes them a great place to get in tune with your form.“I like to lean into the hill as I ascend,” says Valerio. “When you’re extra tired, aid your legs by pressing down on your thighs as you head uphill.” There will be dirt and mud. There will be puddles and streams. So splash! “Have fun with it and laugh it off, it’s part of the ride,” says Kosick. “I’ve walked on all fours like a gorilla or crawled over many slippery areas, and I use trees and rocks to grab onto or pull myself forward.” He recommends wearing a pair of light gloves so you’re not afraid to get a little sap on your hands or grab a wet or dirty rock. “Knowing you have that little bit of protection will help you loosen up and build your confidence so you can enjoy yourself instead of holding yourself back.” Fuel With What You Want to Eat A Guide to Trail Running for Beginners Trail Running Tips for Beginners and Experts How to Make Running With a Water Bottle Easier Save on Frontline Plus Products at Amazon Now How to Run With Poles How a Champion Preps for a Day of Trail Running How to Plan a Hut-to-Hut Running Adventure The 30 Best Gifts for Hikers in 2022 Winter Trail Running Safety Tips 10 Best Hiking Pants for Comfort on Every Trail The Best Hiking Apps for Trail Runners A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

All the Reasons You Might Not Run—and How to Squash Them for Good,"Think you have no time, are too old, or running is too hard? Forget those narratives and start a run routine today. Sure, there are legitimate reasons for occasionally skipping a workout ortaking time off(we’re not here to argue with your doctor or your body, for that matter). But most of what you’re telling yourself about why you can’t start or maintain a regularrunning routinecan often be easily debunked. We spoke with a handful of coaches and experts to get their take on some of the most common reasons runnersbail on their training. They shared insight on what’sreallyholding folks back and offered solutions for experienced runners who have fallen off track, as well asbeginnerswho are hesitant to get started. So prepare to be (gently) called out. Then, put on your shoes and go for that run. Time is a limited resource, and it can be tough to squeeze in a run when a demanding job, family responsibilities, and social obligations are all competing for your attention and energy. But if you’re waiting for things to “calm down” before you commit to a consistent running routine, you may be waiting forever. Instead, try adjusting your expectations. “Ditch thelong workoutsand embrace shorter efforts,” suggests Alison Staples, a coach at&Runningin Howard County, Maryland. “Studiesshow even 20- or 30-minute runs have mental and physicalbenefitsthat outweigh skipping the run altogether,” she says. Plus,prioritizing runningmay help you feel better equipped to manage thestressand chaos of everyday life. “Running allows you to disconnect from a busy workday or what’s going on in your personal life,” says Raj Hathiramani, a certified running coach atMile High Run Clubin New York City. “You may also feel a bit more productive and more energized.” Just make sure to treat your dedicated running time—whether it’s 15 minutes or two hours—the same way you would any other important meeting or appointment. Put it on your calendar, plan accordingly, and keep your commitment. Gearwill make or break your cold-weather running experience. “Dress using layers, and as youwarm upon your run, you can peel them back,” advises coach Gemma Ward,New York Road Runner’srunner training and products specialist. “You can also wear accessories [like thickerglovesand ahatthat covers your ears], which will help keep your hands and head warm,” she says. Just be sure to choose items made with wind-resistant and sweat-wicking fabric. (Nothing will chill you faster than a soggy cotton t-shirt.) Ward also recommends starting yourwarmupinside. “Do some high knees, butt kicks, quick feet, and star jumps to help get that blood flowing and help you get warmed up before you head out into the elements,” she says. Continuing your warmup outside with a focus onproper breathing mechanicswill allow your body to acclimate to the cold and avoid that “lungs on fire” feeling. “Really trying to activate yourdiaphragm, taking those deeper breaths, and doing a more gradualdynamic warmupinside and outside can help you adjust,” Hathirmani says. All bundled up andstillcan’t bring yourself to step out into the tundra? Remind yourself of thebenefits of running in the cold. “You need to be a little bit more mentally resilient to brace for the cold and run outside. Every time you do something that might be more mentally challenging, you’re training your mind to overcome those types of barriers. So it’ll be a lot easier next time or when you have other types ofmental barriers,” Hathiramani says. The promise of a treat—like a toasty bagel or a cup of hot cocoa—can help, too. “Just thinking about that postrun reward can help you get through the cold,” Hathiramani says. If you’re getting adequatesleep, takingrest days, and still feeling drained, you may be running too fast.Todd Buckingham,Ph.D., triathlete, coach, and professor of movement science at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan, often sees this issue among athletes dealing with performanceplateaus,fatigue, repeat injuries, and illnesses. “If you’re running too much or too fast, your body doesn’t recover. [And because you’re not recovered] you’re not running hard enough to get thebenefits of hard running, but you’re also not running slow enough to get thebenefits of slow running,” he says. Buckingham recommends keeping 70 to 80 percent of your training in zones one and two, which should feel easy. (He notes that you don’t have to save all your hard running for one day; most of his workouts intersperse hard efforts, likestrides, into slower-paced runs.) One way to determine yourideal “easy” paceis to take your threshold pace—something you could sustain for about an hour—and add 60 to 90 seconds per minute. Or go by a simpletalk test: You should be able to hold a conversation duringeasy-effort runs. If you’renew to runningor arereturning to the sportafter a break, you can expect to feel a little sore and achy. “Like anything, we need to develop a tolerance for prolonged movement,” saysColleen Brough, D.P.T., assistant professor of rehabilitation and regenerative medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City and director ofColumbia RunLab. Following a gradually progressivetraining planand prioritizingrecoverycan help beginners minimize discomfort andavoid injury. For more experienced runners, chronicsoreness(not just feeling a little stiff after a tougher-than-usual workout) could be a symptom ofovertraining,dehydration, or inadequate rest and recovery. And if you’re dealing with ongoing pain or recurring injuries, there could be a bigger (but often fixable) problem. “[Running] form may be a driver of persistent injury,” Brough adds. A well-trained coach may be able to identify and resolve the issue, or you may need to seek out aphysical therapistwho specializes in running for a more in-depth analysis. Bottom line: Some soreness is normal, but running shouldn’t hurt. So seek professional help if it does. Vacations, family holidays, and work trips will inevitably disrupt your normal routine. But stepping away from your typical schedules androutescan actually enhance the running experience, as long as you approach your workouts with an open mind and a sense of adventure. “Some of my favorite runs have been while I am on vacation,” Ward says. “There is something magical about seeing a new city early in the morning before everyone else wakes up. You can check off some of the popular tourist locations before they become too crowded.” Of course, you need to plan accordingly; pack weather-appropriate gear and research safe running routes in advance. And make sure you know how to get back to where you’re staying in case you find yourself without an internet connection. “You could also look to see if there is a localrunning clubyou could join, which will help take the planning out of where to run. That’s also a way to find local hotspots,” Ward adds. Also, if a scenic run isn’t in the cards—maybe you’re short on time, low onenergy, or stuck in the middle of nowhere—there’s nothing wrong with hopping on thetreadmillin the hotel gym (or family’s basement) for 20 minutes and calling it a day. You’ll still gain benefits and keep your routine consistent. “You are still a runnereven if you walk,” Hathiramani says. “Runners, from beginners to professionals and everything in between, incorporate arun/walk strategyfor different reasons, whether they are building theirendurance, returning from or mitigating an injury, training for anultramarathon, reducingfatigue, or simply making running more enjoyable,” he says. So, if you’re running and walking, keep going. If you want to apply a more structured approach to your training, Hathiramani recommends alternating between one minute of running and two minutes of walking. Over time, you can increase the duration of your runs or switch up the ratio so you’re alternating between a minute of running and a minute of walking or two minutes of running and one minute of walking. Most runners will get stuck in a rut from time to time. “You find yourself running the same loop, same weekly mileage, same intensity runs every single time you lace up. You’re bored and don’t really seeprogress,” Staples says. You don’t have to ditch running altogether to get unstuck. You just have to change something about the way you’re running, she says. “Find a new route. Try newworkouts. Hire a coach. Join a run club. If you’re used to runningmarathons, sign up for a5K,” she says. To help keep yourself accountable, consider scheduling a weekly run with a buddy or joining a gym. “That can motivate you because you’re thinking, ‘I paid money to use this service, so I better go use the service. Otherwise, I’m just losing money every month,’” Buckingham says. You may also find that watching a TV show while you run on thetreadmillor having access to health club amenities makes sticking to your running routine more enjoyable. For months, you’ve beentraining for the big race. Now that it’s over, running seems unappealing and a little pointless. After all, you’re not trainingforanything. “This is when you shouldtake a break. There is nothing wrong with taking a few weeks or even a month or two off if you need it,” Staples says. “As much as we as runners would love to plow through week after week of hard training, our bodies and minds just aren’t built that way. A break is necessary for longevity.” Use your time off to think about your reasons for running that have nothing to do with competitions or events. “I definitely encourage people to disconnect from always working toward something and running for enjoyment. For more than just adistance goal or a time goal. [It’s important] to truly understand why you run, whether it’s yourmeditation, your chance to disconnect, or whether it’s a chance for you to do somethingchallenging,” Hathiramani says. Otherwise, you may find yourself in a never ending cycle of training, events, and burnout. Once you’re ready tostart running again, try exploring a new aspect of the sport. “Maybe you switch from road racing totrail racing, or from a longer distance to a shorter distance. Or you do something more social, like joining arunning groupor a running club,” Hathiramani says. If you have a body and the ability to run, you have arunner’s body. “When it comes to recreational running, everyone has a runner’s body,” Brough says. “Building running volume comes not from our physique, thinness, or height, but by improving cardiovascular endurance,muscular endurance, and mental resilience. All of these elements make a great runner, and each is changeable with time and practice.” Need some inspiration from other runners who felt the same? Read whatStephanie Jackhas to say about embracing the runner identity, and findtips for cultivating a sense of belonging. There’s no official age limit for running. (Just look at the results for the2023 New York City Marathon—more than 440 finishers were between the ages of 70 and 89.) In fact, running may helpseniorspreserve their health, Brough says. “Even as we age, endurance exercise continues to help keep blood pressure andresting heart rateslower and maintain cardiac output and heart strength,” she says. That said, seniors should absolutely have clearance to run from their medical doctor “to be sure there aren’t any underlying cardiac concerns,” Brough says. Older runners should also prioritizerecoveryand incorporatestrength traininginto their fitness routine. “Fast-twitch muscle fibersdecline rapidly as we age, so a goodstrength-training programwill help mitigate this,” Brough says.

The Best Books for Runners in 2024,"From memoir to fiction, health to hope, here are some great reads about running. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? If you’re passionate about running, reading, and reading about running, 2024 should be a good year for you. A handful of books are slated for publication that promise to educate, entertain, and inspire, whether you’re a front-of-pack runner like new memoiristDes Lindenor a passionate participantadvocatesuch as Slow AF Run Club founder Martinus Evans. We cover the newest additions to the running lit space, plus all of our favorite releases from last year—and some classics every runner should have in their library. With the 2024 Paris Olympics kicking off this July, it’s the perfect time to revisit and honor some of the great athletes of past Games. Aime Alley Card’s new release,The Tigerbelles: Olympic Legends from Tennessee State, offers an inspiring glimpse into one of the most globally successful track and field programs of all time. Led by Coach Edward Temple, the 1960 Tennessee State University all-Black women’s track team, which includedWilma Rudolph, Barbara Jones, Lucinda Williams, Martha Hudson, Willye B. White, and Shirley Crowder, won an astonishing 23 medals in the 1960 Rome Olympics. In doing so, they challenged “the world’s perception of what a group of young Black women in the Jim Crow south were capable of” and inspired generations of track athletes to come.(January 2, 2024) Whenever she steps onto the track for her signature event, the 400-meter hurdles, world record holder and Olympic championSydney McLaughlin-Levronelooks nothing but confident, composed, and bulletproof. What fans don’t see, however, are her chronic struggles with anxiety, perfectionism, and people-pleasing, and her lingering uncertainty about her identity and worthiness. InFar Beyond Gold, McLaughlin-Levrone shares how her faith has helped her overcome her fears, push past her perceived limits, and accomplished more than she ever thought possible. She hopes that her story will help others do the same, in whatever realm is meaningful to them.(January 30, 2024) Jeff Galloway’spublication countwill continue to grow this year withRunning: Getting Started. The latest title from the 1972 Olympian, coach,Runner’s Worldcolumnist, and prolific author is a sweeping introduction to the sport, intended “for any person, at any fitness level, looking to start running for the first time, return to running after a break, or reset their training.” Galloway outlines what you need to start running, how to implement a training plan and fit it into your life, and everything you should know about nutrition, form, injuries, racing, and more, before you hit the ground running.(March 1, 2024) If you’ve ever been part of a running club, collaborated with a stranger in a road race, or bonded with a training partner over your shared suffering, the thought has probably crossed your mind that runners are a special breed. But what about this sport so often brings out the good in participants? InThe Examined Run: Why Good People Make Better Runners, philosopher and ultrarunner Sabrina B. Little “asks whether running can be a laboratory for developing our character,” as it so often seems. She draws on her experiences in training, racing, and coaching to explore the relationship between athletics and virtue, offering a refreshing change of pace from the negative headlines we’re seeing more and more often.(March 21, 2024) Many NCAA and pro running fans are familiar with the names Elvin Kibet and Shadrack Kipchirchir, Kenyan-born runners who earned scholarships to the United States, racked up several All-American awards between them, fell into a relationship, and are now chasing their dreams as part of theU.S. Army World Class Athlete Program. But few fans are probably aware of the struggles that both Kibet and Kipchirchir overcame, including poverty, bigotry, pressure, and an entirely new culture to adjust to, to get where they are now. InAll in Stride,Johanna Garton pulls back the curtain on these inspiring soldier-athletes, and sheds light on their pursuits of the American dream.(April 2, 2024) Although she’s best known as a BBC broadcaster, TV personality, and DJ, Adele Roberts is also an accomplished marathoner, with a remarkable claim to fame that she details inPersonal Best. Just a year and a half after being diagnosed with bowel cancer, and then undergoing chemotherapy and countless other obstacles alongside her supportive partner Kate Holderness,she set a Guinness World Recordfor fastest marathon run by a female with an ileostomy. Roberts’s story demonstrates what it looks like to thrive in the aftermath of a major setback, and offers hope to others wondering if they have it in them, too.(April 11, 2024) Much has been written about South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya, as much for her five global championship victories in the 800 meters as for her body, her hyperandrogenism (excess levels of testosterone), and her place in the sporting world. Through her memoirThe Race to Be Myself, published last fall, Semenya sets the record straight and shares what it’s been like to live in the spotlight from her breakthrough at age 18, andwhat she’s gone through since thenin order to keep pursuing her passion and competing at the highest of levels.(October 31, 2023) Twice an Olympian andglobal medalist, Kara Goucher gained a platform with her speed and stamina. Now she’s using her voice to tell her version of theNike Oregon Project doping scandaland to advocate for females in the running space and beyond. Her memoir, which comes out in March and is the culmination of three years of work, is calledThe Longest Race. “Yes, my book is about the running industry,” Goucher says, “but it can really be applied to women everywhere. I want them to know that they are not alone… that they can get through the most difficult of times and that they have power in their voices.” (March 14, 2023) You can fill a small library with books on running, but you won’t find many that touch onqueernessandfeminismin the sport. ThroughRunning (Practices), sociology professor and former NCAA Division I runner Lindsey A. Freeman wants to bring these topics to the forefront and spawn connections along the way. “Runningis an attempt to write the queer and feminist book about running that I always wanted but couldn’t find,” Freeman says. Her storytelling, along with her friend Hazel Meyer’s illustrations, chronicles Freeman’s lifelong relationship with running and illuminates the “unexpected moments of connection and joy that we runners feel when we cover some distance together.”(March 14, 2023) If you still get goosebumps remembering Des Linden breaking the tape at the 2018 Boston Marathon—the first American woman in 33 years to do so—get pumped for Linden’s forthcoming memoir,Choosing to Run, a collaboration with prolific sportswriter Bonnie D. Ford. In what she calls “an underdog story, an outsider story, and a story about the constant wrestle of fitting running into my life in a way that’s sustainable and fulfilling,” she offers a behind-the-scenes look at the training and mindset that precipitated twoOlympic berthsand that epic Boston victory. Not just for elites, Linden says, “I think anybody who has a passion for lacing up their running shoes and getting out the door will see a bit of themselves in my journey and hopefully be inspired to keep showing up.”(April 4, 2023) Kenyan coach Patrick Sang guidedEluid Kipchogeto the first-ever sub-2-hour marathon and inWe Share the Sun, Sarah Gearhart’s biography, runners will get a window into this living legend’s coaching philosophy and his relationship with his athletes. “I wanted to write a book that gives Coach Patrick Sang his due,” Gearhart says of the project that took her three years to complete. Through it, she also offers her perspective on the world ofKenyan distance running, and all of “the risk, sacrifice, and determination it takes to establish oneself as a championship-caliber athlete in the world’s distance running hotbed.”(April 4, 2023) Just because running is available to all doesn’t mean that it’s welcome to all:Martinus Evansknows this as well as anyone. When he began his running journey 10 years ago in a 300-something-pound body, he says, “All I wanted was someone to talk to who had experienced exactly what I was going through.”Slow AF Run Clubis intended to fill that void. A coach with an exercise science degree who has now run eight marathons, Evans calls it “a blueprint for those who may not fit the image of a ‘traditional’ runner—that is, someone who is larger in size, less athletic, out of shape, or dealing with any kind of health issue that slows them down—to feel empowered to lace up their shoes and embrace thebody they have right now.” (June 6, 2023) About a decade after he wrote the smash hitBorn to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen, Christopher McDougall is back with an illustrated training guide calledBorn to Run 2. A collaboration between McDougall andBorn to Runcoach Eric Orton (also the author ofThe Cool Impossible),Born to Run 2is “a holistic program for runners of every stripe” that focuses onfood, fitness, form,footwear, focus, fun, and family. Inside you’ll find a 90-daytraining schedule, runner-friendly recipes, corrective drills, shoe recommendations, and more. (December 2022) Runners love to read! Itstokes enthusiasmand turns an individual sport into one in which everyone is sharing their experience. Some books focus on training so you can become a better runner. Others explore the epic journeys from some of the top names in the sport, like Scott Jurek on his amazing Appalachian Trail journey or Meb Keflezighi detailing all of the big marathons in his illustrious career. This list includes someRunner’s Worldfavorites from the past few years, and together they have recipes, stories, training plans, and encouragement. Even if you don’t get paid to run, you can still approach your craft like a professional. Learn how throughRun Like a Pro (Even If You’re Slow)by Ben Rosario, coach of Northern Arizona Elite and Olympic marathonerAliphine Tuliamuk, andMatt Fitzgerald, prolific fitness writer and 2:39 marathoner. By all indicators, ifsteeplechaseworld championEmma Coburnisn’t on the track or in the gym, there’s a good chance she’s in the kitchen, whipping up elaborate meals for her Team Boss teammates and impressive cakes for friends and family. Her goal forThe Runner’s Kitchen, featuring 100 of her favorite recipes, is “to open people’s eyes to the joy, and health, of having a diet with a variety of carbs, protein, fats, fruits and veggies, and sugar.” Coburn also hopes to debunk the myth, especially prevalent among young female runners, that a restrictive diet is the way to go. In classic Matt Fitzgerald style,The Comeback Quotientcombines real-world experiences with cutting-edge science, this time to demystify the beloved sports comeback story. “I wrote the book for athletes of all stripes who want to become mentally fitter,” Fitzgerald says. Usingultrarunners,triathletes, and road runners like cover model (and Olympic Marathon qualifier)Molly Siedelas inspiration, he breaks down the three-step process that great athletes use to bounce back from adversity. Psychology of endurance expertNoel Brick, Ph.D., andRunner’s Worldcontributing writerScott DouglaswroteThe Genius of Athletes“to help everyday athletes learn and hone the thinking skills that top athletes use” for application within and outside the confines of sport. Readers will learn the five key types of cognitive tools for navigating challenges.

This Duo Ran More Than 100 Miles in Just Over 48 Hours—All for Cancer Research,"Lindsey Fritz and Zoe Schaap ran from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to Montauk to raise money for a good cause. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Name:Lindsey FritzAge: 23Hometown: New York CityOccupation: Influencer marketing specialist at IBMTime Running: 2 years Name:Zoe SchaapAge: 21Hometown: New York CityOccupation: Student at Fordham UniversityTime Running: 13 years Our friendship started in 2023 at the pool of our local gym. We were both training for half Ironman races and immediately connected over the idea of pushing ourselves to new limits with physically and mentally demanding challenges. Since that day, we’ve been swimming, running, andbikingtogether around New York City. Running has bonded us on our good days and our bad days, and we’ve had many meaningful conversations along the way—forcing us to stay inzone 2at a conversational pace while we went (LOL). Our bond for running together has inspired our family members and friends to step outside of their comfort zones andstart running, too. Inspired by the journeys of our close family members who are currently battling cancer or have fought it for years, we found a shared purpose in using our passion for running to support a cause close to our hearts. MSK 2 MTK, our charity run for cancer, started as an idea on a whiteboard in Lindsey’s room and turned into a 123-mile, 48-hour run from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to the Montauk Point Lighthouse (MTK). It ultimately includes a full-fledged fundraising initiative with a team of more than 20 people and 15 brand supporters. Every dollar raised through MSK 2 MTK will go toward cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in honor of cancer patients, survivors, and those who are no longer with us. We chose to run and raise money for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center because we’ve witnessed the exceptional care they provide to people we know who were treated there and are impressed by the groundbreaking research they’ve conducted over the years. Our original goal was to raise $12,300. We began our run on Thursday, May 9, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and ended in Centereach, Long Island for a total of 55 miles. On Friday, May 10, we started at Centereach and ended at Southampton, Long Island for a total of 40 miles. We left Southampton and ended at Montauk Point Lighthouse for a total of 28 miles. With more than 245,227 steps counted, we raised $23,230 within six weeks of announcing the run. When we came up with the idea of MSK 2 MTK, neither of us had run more than amarathonin one day. So why not make it almost five marathons? We believe that by using our passions for running, philanthropy, and intense challenges, no ideas are off limits. We hope MSK 2 MTK inspired our communities to use their passions to make a difference. “During the 123-mile run, I discovered a part of myself that I hadn’t known existed. This pushed my limits to another level both physically and mentally. Creating and growing this initiative with Zoe has been the most meaningful experience of my life thus far, building a community united by a cause that impacts all of us to some degree.” —Lindsey Fritz “The run was truly transformative. We were running for those who had battled cancer, and that reality made every step more meaningful. There were times when it got incredibly tough—running on highways, through patches of grass, and even getting pulled over. We became numb to the constant pounding of our footsteps. But the sense of community I felt during those 2.5 days was unmatched. This experience showed me that when you run for something bigger than yourself, you realize how much more you can achieve when you put your mind to it.” —Zoe Schaap Especially in the beginning, do not focus on the time or pace. You willbuild more enduranceby running at a comfortable pace than sprinting and not being able to sustain it. Whether that is a cause you are running for like raising money for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or you are trying to overcome a tough time in your life, your why will make running that much more meaningful. Friends, family, or even people you meet in the pool—convince them to join you. You should also look into local running clubs in your town or city.

Your Race Fuel Should Be Foods You Actually Want to Eat,"When gels and chews aren't appetizing, use these alternatives to get the calories you need. As an ultrarunner, I’m all too familiar with the saying that long-distance running is an “eating contest with a running component.” I constantly experiment withgels, gummies, drink mixes, andbars, trying to figure out how to get the calories and carbs I need to get through hundreds of miles. Being able totake in fuelis easily the biggest factor that can make or break a race. Over the past 10 years, I think I’ve gotten things pretty dialed in. I’ve discovered gels from the brand Enervit that go down easy, sit well in my stomach, and helped me breeze through my spring 100-miler in fifth place. But fueling isn’t always so simple. Some days, my stomach wakes up more sensitive, and I can’t convince myself to throw back gel after gel. Other days, I run so long I get tired of the fuel I’ve been using and just need to switch things up. So here are some of the race-tested alternatives to gels I’ve found success with that you can try on your runs. So many fuel options are based on carbs and sweet flavors, but sometimes I simply crave something salty. Potato chips and pretzels can help replace electrolytes lost in sweat. A small bag of potato chips can provide 170mg of sodium and 350mg of potassium, rivaling electrolyte capsules. They go down easily with water, practically dissolving while taking sips. The breadiness of these can also help absorb acid in my stomach and settle things when I experience some sloshing. On long ultras where there are hours between aid stations, and the weight of everything I have to carry becomes more of a factor, I like to take a snack-size Ziploc bag of calorie-dense cashews. A relatively small package easily puts about 600 to 800 calories in my pocket. When I’m spending all day on the trail, it also helps to have food like this that makes it feel like I’m eating a real meal from time to time. It’s a great option for something that goes down easily. I go with GoGo SqueeZ applesauce. They have a few different flavors; apple cinnamon and apple strawberry are my favorites. A bit lower in calories than gels, at 70 per packet, they are better used as a supplement, not a main source of fuel. For faster efforts like a 90-minute training run, or racing a half marathon, I find it more difficult to take in gels. I want my fuel to go down as quickly as possible, so I’ll opt for a high-calorie drink mix, like Tailwind, to consume the carbs I need with as little effort as possible. A standard 500mL soft flask provides 200 calories, similar to what I get from two gels.

3 Myths About the Run/Walk Method,"Adding walk breaks to your training runs and races just might provide your ticket to faster finishes or longer distances. Many runners have a few dirty little secrets, like not quite making it to thebathroomorchafingin unmentionable spots. But one thing many runners also won’t admit to... walking. That is, unless you embrace the run/walk method, which involves adding precisely planned walk intervals to your runs. The run/walk method can offer runners many benefits, including helping tofight off fatigue. It can even help you clock faster finish times and maybe even win a race that you thought was out of reach. Just look to Marc Burget for evidence. Aultramarathonrun/walker, Burget, 50, won the 2016 Daytona 100 (miles) in 14 hours and 14 minutes which, at the time, was a course record. “The idea that you should move from walking to running is the wrong framework,” Burget,  director of operations at Bailey’s Health and Fitness in Jacksonville, Florida tellsRunner’s World. “Instead, putting walks in myrace plansallows me to go the whole 100 miles without becoming tired.” Research supports Burget’s experience. According to a 2016 study published in theJournal of Science and Medicine in Sports, of the 42 runners studied, those who used the run/walk method  in a marathon reported less muscle pain andfatigueand finished with similar times, compared to those who only ran. So, while it’s true that runners typically move faster than walkers, it’s also true that during long races ortraining runs, taking well-timed walk breaks can help you reach your goals. To understand the run/walk method, here are common myths  and truths about the training and racing strategy, plus how to test out the system for yourself. In recent years, more runners and experts have learned thatzone 2 running(that is, lower effort runs), improves many elements of fitness and supports your ability to run both long- and short-distance races withoutfatiguingas quickly. Whatever distance you race, it’s important to manage yourenergy levelsfrom the start, so you can make it to the finish withoutbonking. While fuel plays a role in maintaining energy,how you pace a raceis also crucial. “There’s a myth that a lot of runners perpetuate about banking time,” Chris Twiggs, chief training officer at Galloway Training Programs tellsRunner’s World. “The time bank doesn’t exist. The bank that does exist is the bank ofenergy. When you walk during your run, you are investing in the bank of energy.” Burget agrees. The first time he ran 100 miles, he planned to run the whole way, but because of exhaustion, he ended up walking about 20 miles. Once he started to train with the run/walk method, he cut his walking down to 10 to 15 miles thanks to 30-second walk intervals. Now, with experience, most of his ultras include eight to 10 miles of walking and he either alternates three minutes of running and 30 seconds of walking, or 0.3 miles of running and 30 seconds of walking, depending on his race strategy and goals. If you have your mind on aPR, the run/walk method could help you get there. You just have to practice. “Your walk should be brisk, but not work,” says Burget. “You want yourheart rateto drop down.” You also want to give your muscles a break from the intense effort to allow for a midrun recovery. Because you’re walking, you also need to make your runintervalsfaster than if you’re going for a steady-state run. For example, let’s say you want to average an 8-minute per mile pace for a marathon. Try running a 7:40 pace for nine-tenths of a mile, then walk for 30 seconds, so that you finish a mile in eight minutes. “You’re not losing 30 seconds,” Burget explains. “You’re moving forward, but part of your pace is a walk.” Likewise, if you want to maintain an 11-minutepace, you could do a 40-second walk every three minutes of running at around a 10:20 pace per mile. If you have been running for a bit but you don’t know where to start with your interval ratios and paces, do a “magic mile” run, both experts say. This will help set your goal pace for a race. With that magic mile time in mind, set your interval ratios, keeping in mind that generally, the faster your average pace, the longer your run intervals. For example, if you’re aiming for an 8-minute mile average pace, you may run three minutes and walk 30 seconds. But if you’re aiming for a 10-minute mile average pace, you may run 90 seconds and walk 30 seconds. If you’re a beginner, Twiggs suggests starting your workouts by running for 30 seconds and walking for 30 seconds. If that seems too easy or you can feel yourself wanting to run more keep the 30-second walk, but run slightly longer between walks, he says. You can keep track of your ratio usingtime or distance. Twiggs uses time, while Burget often pays attention to the mile markers in his races, walking for the last tenth of each mile. Play around with what works best for you. “It took me a few months to figure out the ratio that works for me,” says Burget, who has also run a 2:50 marathon by alternating six-minute runs and 15-second walks. When you want to actuallyincrease your average paceper mile, do another magic mile to see how much faster you can go, and then either increase the speed of your run intervals, add more time to the run intervals, or cut down on the time of your walk breaks. While there are no statistics on how many runners use walks in theirtrainingor in their races, how long they’ve been running, or how  “tired” any runner is when they walk, we can confidently say that runners who strive to incorporate walks into their runs are all ages and all levels of fitness. Both Burget and Twiggs run ultras, something less than1 percent of Americansdid in 2023, and ultrarunners typically aren’t new to the running game. In fact, planning your run/walk strategy for races can take practice so many experienced runners and walkers may turn to it. For example, Burget has learned to time his walks to match the location ofhydrationstops and elevation gain in his ultras so he can maximize his running potential. But that came with lots of practice using the run/walk method. Always study the details of your upcoming race and consider creating a strategy to match walks with water stations and hills. “Looking at the landscape when planning your run/walk is important,” says Burget. “Walking hillsis smart because we want to do what we can to conserve our energy so that when we expend our energy we get the most bang for our buck,” says Twiggs. Running up hillsduring training will help you build leg strength, but in a race it could decrease your pace (and finish time) because it takes so much effort, adds Twiggs.  Without planning, you might find yourself running up a hill (wasted effort) and then walking a descent as you recover. Planning ahead can help you flip that to maximize your energy and increase your speed. The point: Go into your race with a clear plan that has specifically planned walk breaks so you’re not just slowing it down when you feel like it, which could be a detriment to performance, Twiggs explains. Playing around with your run/walk ratios during training will also help you set this in stone come race day. The reason running is defined as “high” intensity while walking is considered “low to moderate” intensity is because it takesmore energyto run than to walk. Typically, your heart beats more frequently when you run than when you walk in order for your body to produce that extra effort. Break up those runs with walks, though, and you are giving your heart, muscles, bones, and joints a break. It’s helps with the deposit into your energy bank, as Twiggs says. The benefit of those deposits? You may be able to add to yourrace schedule, say by running ahalf marathoninstead of a 10K, if that has seemed out of reach. If you think you can’t run amarathon, could you run/walk one? To prove the point that adding walks intolong runscan cut down on fatigue and help you go longer (or even run more frequently), take another example from Burget: In 2023, he ran seven marathons in seven consecutive days, aiming for a sub-three-hour finish for each race. While he ran just over three hours in two of the races, his other times ranged from 2:52:15 to 2:58:57. “I used the same interval for each race,” Burget says, “a 20-second walk during each mile.” While you experiment with run/walk intervals, try to notice how you feel in comparison to runs that don’t include walks. Do you feel like you can increase your typical run distance or duration by a half-mile or 10 minutes? To progress tolonger distances, you have a variety of options: You can increase the pace of your runs or shorten the walk breaks you take, says Twiggs, while still running for the same overall amount of time. (This will increase your average pace.) Or you can maintain your pace and your ratio, but add more rounds of intervals, so you run for a longer duration and therefore, distance, which may come easier than only running because of the added recovery element. Do what feels best for you. In addition to helping you conquer longer distances, the run/walk method might increase your race options by also allowing you to take part in multi-day events, such asrunDisney weekendsor Philadelphia’s Marathon Weekend, which includes an 8K, half, and marathon. While some runners, of course, take part in these events without using the run/walk method, “we’ve seen anecdotally that for millions of runners, this allows them to run races they would not have otherwise considered,” says Twiggs, because it can allow for that quickerrecovery.

This Runner Turned Her Passion Into a Social Media Business,"“Running allowed me to connect with myself on a deeper level and find strength I didn’t know I had.” We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Name:Kate MackzAge:27Hometown:Brooklyn, New YorkOccupation:Content creator and host ofThe Running Interview Show + Post Run HighReason for Running:I’ve always loved running. I took to it early on, and it quickly became a big part of my life. At 14, I was a freshman starter on the varsity lacrosse team—a dream I’d had since I was a kid. At the end of the spring season, I jumped to intercept a pass, landed wrong, and felt mykneegive out. I had torn my ACL, MCL, and meniscus in an instant. Before I knew it, I was having reconstructive surgery on my right knee and then started a year of grueling rehab. It was like my world turned upside down. I went from being a three-sport varsity athlete to learninghow to walkand run again. It was tough on mymental health, so I decided to turn it into something positive. I started a blog and created videos about every step of myrecovery—from pre-surgery doctor visits to every little milestone. The blog became a space for other young athletes going through ACL rehab to connect and support each other. Just a month after I was cleared to play again—and of course, after sharing my excitement with my followers—I tore my ACL a second time. Same knee, same sport. The graft from the first surgery had completely torn, and I was devastated all over again. At 15, I made the hard call to let go of my dream to play lacrosse in college, which all of my friends and siblings went on to do. I just didn’t have it in me to face another surgery and another year of rehab. But, in that year of recovery, I found something new to love: running. It’s funny how you learn to appreciate something even more when it’s almost taken away from you. Initially, I ran about five to six times a week, graduallyincreasing my distanceand learning what worked best for me without relying on formaltraining plansor apps. Running gave me a sense of purpose and something to focus on outside of my physical limitations. It allowed me to connect with myself on a deeper level and find strength I didn’t know I had. It became a therapeutic outlet, helping me process and move forward from the setbacks I faced. Over the years, I’ve participated in many races to stay motivated. I’ve completed manyhalf marathons, with the More Women’s Half Marathon in Central Park being a favorite. I’ve also tackled three marathons: theNew York City Marathontwo times and the Philadelphia marathon one time. The idea forThe Running Interview Show,a social media account,came from my passion for running and my love for storytelling. I realized that running provides a unique backdrop for open and heartfelt conversations. My fiancé, Jeremy, and I brainstormed a social media framework for the running interview show and crafted my go-to pick up-line: “Hey, how many miles are you running today?” I got after it and started myRunning Interview TikTokin April 2023. To get the show off the ground, I initially approached strangers on the street, offering them a pair of shoes to join me for a run and share their stories. This grassroots approach was a bit of a financial strain, and I even went into debt in the early stages to support it. I was working a job at an advertising agency, and let’s just say that my salary was definitely not supporting my need to buy and give away more than 20 pairs of sneakers a month. I would film episodes every day before heading to my day job, which meant balancing a tight schedule and financial strain. Despite these hurdles, it’s been incredibly rewarding to see how running fosters genuine connections and meaningful dialogues with a diverse range of guests. I run with guests almost every day. After the runs, we sit down while we’re still buzzing for my new podcast,Post Run High. The new show allows us to dive even deeper into the conversations we started during our runs. In my free time, I’ve also leaned intoPilates and yogato complement my running routine and support overall flexibility and strength. I’m looking forward to continuing to explore newrunning routeswith different guests and further integratingcross-trainingpractices into my routine. It’s an exciting balance of maintaining endurance while enhancing my overall fitness. I want other runners to know that my journey hasn’t been a straight line—it’s been filled with ups and downs,injuries, and detours. But through it all, running has been a constant source of joy and self-discovery. My advice to those looking tostart runningis simple: just start. Don’t worry about your pace or distance at first. Find joy in the movement, listen to your body, and remember that every step you take is a step forward. Running is a personal journey, and there’s no right or wrong way to do it. Trusting your body and knowing when to push or rest is key to staying injury-free andenjoying runninglong-term. It’s important to be mindful and adapt your training based on how you feel. Regular practice, even when motivation is low,builds enduranceand strengthens the mind-body connection. Small, consistent efforts lead to big gains over time. One tip I always emphasize is to run with a friend. Having arunning buddynot only makes the miles go by faster but also keeps you motivated and accountable. It’s a great way to make running more enjoyable and stick to your routine! →Adidas Ultraboost 5x Shoe: I’m currently loving these as my everyday trainers. →Adizero Prime x 2.0 Strung Running Shoes: These are fun sneakers that provide a little extra spring on the days you need it →Nuun Sport Electrolyte Powder Packets in Pink Lemonade Flavor: We all know the importance ofstaying hydratedwhether you are a runner or not, and these taste amazing.

Height: 12.8 in. | Weight: 3 lb. | Power: 750 W | Max cook size: 20 L Sous vide precision cookers, also known as immersion circulators, take the guesswork out of cooking meat. Just submerge vacuumed-sealed foods in a pot of water, add the sous vide wand, and the app will tell you when it’s done.CNETcalled the Anova Nano “a great sous vide starting point” for those who are interested in cooking their protein like a professional at an affordable cost. You can use the Nano to cook veggies and other foods, but it’s best for preparing red meats and fish. OneAmazonreviewer wrote, “What I really like about this is that I can just look up a recipe in the app on my phone, throw the meat into a Ziploc bag, push the start button, and forget about it.” Though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi connectivity, it does connect to your phone app through Bluetooth. That means you can set up the pot and wand and still go out for that long run while the app notifies you when it’s ready. If Wi-Fi capability is a must to control from anywhere, you can always spring for the more expensive15-inch Anova Precision Cooker.

That’s where veggie spiralizers come in! OXO’s Tabletop Spiralizer can transform vegetables and fruits into fun noodles with three different  blades: 1/8-inch spaghetti, 1/4-inch fettuccine, and ribbon blades. You can get creative with it too—it not only works with zucchini, but also with other produce such as sweet potatoes, apples, and even butternut squash. Just keep in mind that spiralizers tend not to work on thin, small veggies like carrots. “We’ve tried a few different veggies and fruits through the spiralizer. It’s a great way to make food more fun,” wrote one buyer fromBed Bath & Beyond, “If you’re a foodie who enjoys employing creative ways to serve dishes, you will enjoy the OXO Good Grips Spiralizer.” In its testing,Food & Winewrote that the OXO spiralizer “was easy to assemble, the base felt sturdier, the suction grip held tighter, the crank held firmly to every sort of produce I threw at it, and it turned more smoothly and with less force.” That’s because, as opposed to hand-held spiralizers, this model suctions onto your countertop so it stays sturdy and still. The handle is also collapsible and the spiralizer comes with a plastic case to store the unit compactly and safely until next time. Total Expert Score:88/100 |Consumer Score:84% give it 4 stars or higherA versatile, one-touch grinder for anything from coffee beans to nuts, herbs, and spices. Dimensions: 3.5 x 3 x 6.8 in. | Weight: 1 lb. | Size: 3 oz. of beans or 12 cups of coffee There’s nothing like a steaming cup of coffee to get you motivated for an early-morning run. Krups’s Electric Coffee Grinder gives you freshly ground coffee with just one touch, perfect for whatever your preferred brewing method is. It doesn’t take up much space on the counter, but can still grind up to 3 ounces of beans for 12 cups of coffee at a time. But its uses aren’t limited to coffee beans. This small electric grinder is also great for crushing nuts, herbs, and spices into powder.Serious Eatsreported, “It was one of our fastest and most consistent grinders, crushing cinnamon to a fine powder in 60 seconds and cumin in 40.” Some users warned if you use it for both spices and coffee, you may end up with a hint of cinnamon in your morning joe. In addition to its quick blending, consumers also loved its compact size and its low volume to not wake sleeping family members in the morning. “The grinding process is quiet, quick, and under 10 seconds for my preference,” wrote one buyer fromWalmart. Total Expert Score:90/100 |Consumer Score:87% give it 4 stars or higherRinse, mix, and serve your salads right from this classic stainless steel bowl. Dimensions: 10.5 x 10.5 x 7.5 in. | Bowl capacity: 6.3 qt. | Basket capacity: 4.95 qt. Though this device may seem expensive for a salad spinner, it comes with a colander to rinse greens inside a 6-quart stainless-steel bowl that can be used separately as a serving or mixing bowl. The clear lid includes a pump to spin your produce with just one hand, and is dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.The Spruce Eatsdescribed, “The top knob locks down for more compact storage, and the bowl has a nonslip base that keeps it from skidding around the counter while in use.” Consumers also loved how much more durable this bowl is compared to plastic spinners. “I spin all cleaned vegetables in the OXO salad spinner. It is such a handy item which is used daily in our home,” wrote one onAmazon. In addition to washing greens and other vegetables, you can try using it to spin excess water from pasta, beans, berries, and more.

Dimensions: 4.5 x 4.5 x 21 in. | Weight: 4 lb. | Voltage: 120V Blenders seem essential for any runner’s diet to make nutritious smoothies, protein shakes, and soups. But instead of a bulky countertop blender, what if you could switch to a smaller tool that can do even more? KitchenAid’s 5-Speed Hand Blender comes with a multipurpose blade as well as a whisk and chopper attachment so it can perform like any blender, mixer, or food processor—all in one slim device that can slide away in a kitchen drawer. Along with the 1-liter blending pitcher with a no-splash lid, it comes with a 2.5-cup chopper attachment perfect for nuts and herbs. “It’s powerful, quiet, and of course, has five speeds to choose from,” wroteBusiness Insider.“The 8-inch blending arm is handy for deep pots of soup or tall smoothie cups.”Amazonreviewers also appreciated how KitchenAid includes a plastic storage case and a pan protector to prevent the blender from scratching bowls and pans. “It comes with a very nice case for all your attachments and fits nicely in a drawer right next to my stove,” commented one. Consumer Score:87% give it 4 stars or higherYou won’t have to strain to store and clean this easy, clip-on colander. Dimensions: 9.2 x 3.6 x 2.6 in. | Weight: 5 oz. | BPA Free | Dishwasher Safe Most colanders take up a lot of space in the cabinet and sink, but this snap-on strainer will clip on to most pots and mixing bowls to drain liquids without taking up too much space. It’s dishwasher safe, and the plastic is flexible enough to fit a majority of round pots, pans, and bowls. “Made from silicone, this can handle the heat from boiling liquids,”The Spruce Eatsalso noted. Amazonbuyers reported that the strainer worked well for heavy as well as small foods too. “The strainer is especially good for small items such as rice or angel hair pasta and it works like a charm,” wrote one. Consumer Score:75% give it 4 stars or higherTry these storage pods to keep your herbs fresh and protected without wasting money. Dimensions: 2.4 x 3.5 x 11.3 in. | Weight: 6.4 oz. | BPA Free | Top-Rack Dishwasher Safe This convenient little storage device promises to triple the life of your herbs. Its cylindrical design fits snugly on any fridge door, and the clear window will remind you what herbs you have and when you’re running low—so no more wasting packs of wilting herbs crushed in the back of the crisper drawer! It’s easy to use too, simply place them in the pod and add water through the cap. Just remember to replace the water every 3 to 5 days, and your herbs will last up to three weeks. With the three-pack, you can use these pods for anything from parsley to cilantro to even asparagus. “The flavor also leaves when you wash it, so your rosemary won’t smell and taste like thyme from the previous batch,” wroteGear Hungry. OneAmazonreviewer explained that they keep “fresh herbs and asparagus longer since they stand up instead of laying down and collecting moisture on just one side. Plus they look cute, and the herbs are on display for ease in grabbing.” Consumer Score:85% give it 4 stars or higherA safe, easy method for cutting, slicing, and scooping avocados—all in one. Dimensions: 2.25 x 7.75 in. | Weight: .32 oz. | Top-Rack Dishwasher Safe Do you often struggle to cut open, dice, and pop the core out of an avocado without cutting a finger or making a mess? This 3-in-1 slicer could be the best way to access your favorite fruit pain-free. It has a nonslip grip, plastic blade, fan blade that cuts seven sections, and stainless steel center to remove the core. “Even kids will be able to help make guacamole when you have this in the kitchen!” wroteThe Spruce Eats. Though someAmazonreviewers noticed that it’s more difficult to hand wash than other utensils, one said, “yes, I can halve pit and slice an avocado with a knife and spoon, but when I factor in how fast and easy it sliced an avocado, I think that it evens out.” For guacamole-lovers who always have avocados on hand, this single-use device may be worthwhile. Consumer Score:93% give it 4 stars or higherA fun, easy tool to shred meat and for BBQ lovers. Dimensions: 12 x 16 in. | Weight: 4 oz. | Heat Resistant | BPA free | Top-Rack Dishwasher Safe If you love barbecuing, pulled pork, turkey, and other meats, these “claws” are the easiest way to lift and shred meat. “Don’t pay an absurd amount for shredded meat,”Gear Hungrysuggested, “just grab a cheap cut and do it on your own.” In addition to saving time and money, it’s also just a fun accessory that will make you feel like Wolverine. The Bear Claws have an impressive average of 4.7 stars from almost 3,000Amazonreviews. Many reviewers raved about the sharp plastic and large handles that fit anyone’s hands. “They’re super sharp, comfortable to hold (even for larger hands), and very well made,” wrote one. However, some warned about receiving less-effective knock-off versions from unofficial sellers. Consumer Score:75% give it 4 stars or higherA versatile mandoline that can help cut French fries, juice oranges, or grate cheese. Dimensions: 13 x 5 x 6 in. | Weight: 1.8 lb. | Blade sizes: 3–9 mm Since most home chefs can always use a little more space, this multifunction mandoline is the best tool for slicing, shredding, dicing, grating, and even juicing all in one device. Its legs fold for compact storage, and it comes with 5 different blades for straight, wavy, julienne, and French-fry cuts. OneAmazonbuyer wrote, “I love that it has so many attachments and different ways to slice and grate and prep food for endless meals.” Use it on firm veggies like potatoes and carrots or soft tomatoes and cabbage.

How to Be a Better Runner,"Use these universal truths to start going the extra mile with your running, from picking smart goals to learning how to make it feel easier. One of the best things about running is it can be a lifelong pursuit. Regardless of age or speed, you can find newways to improve, and you don’t have to look far to see runners getting better at what they love to do. Whether it’s winning your age group in a5K, increasing yourmileage, returning to runningpostpartum, or utilizingmental toolsto get stronger in the marathon, there are many ways to make a jump that works for you. In interviews withRunner’s World, elite athletes and coaches shared different strategies that helped them and others reach the next level. Here’s what they’ve learned. Professional ultrarunner and mental performance coachAddie Bracyhas learned becoming a better runner doesn’t always mean getting faster. For years, the 37-year-old has chased time goals as an NCAA All-American, U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials qualifier, and elite 100-mile racer. While speed has been a fulfilling pursuit at various times in her career, it’s far from the only way to measure improvement. Bracy says it’s important to be honest with yourself and take inventory of other areas where you can improve beyond speed, as that can often lead to overreaching early in the running process. “It’s easy to think of it as just running faster, when often it’s nutrition,sleepingmore, or strength training.” Bracy tries to be intentional about pinpointing an area of improvement during a training block and finding ways to measure the effect for a period of time. For example, she’s currently trying to get better atrunning downhill. This season, she’s incorporated more workouts to help her run efficiently on descents so she can be faster while covering downhill sections of the trail. She’s already seen progress with a recent victory at theTushars Mountain Runs 70Kin July. Bonus tip:If you’re feeling fatigued during easy workouts or tired even when you’re resting,nutrition deficiencies may be affecting your running. A nutrition panel and support from a registered dietician can help you plan a successful fueling strategy and lead to major breakthroughs on race day. Once you find an area where you can improve, it’s time to dive into goal setting. In his own running career and with the athletes he coaches,Gilbert Tuhabonye, founder ofGilbert’s Gazellesand a survivor of the Tutsi-Hutu war of Burundi, has seen first-hand the power of this practice. From his first race in seventh grade at school in Burundi, Tuhabonye was hooked on the idea of winning titles. Working with his coach on setting goals, establishing benchmarks along the way, and achieving those goals helped the rising track star build self-confidence. Early on, goal-setting also helped Tuhabonye cope with tragedy. After narrowly escaping a massacre in his hometown, Tuhabonye ended up in the hospital with severe burns, but he was determined to return to the sport he loves. He started by walking one lap at a nearby track. With the goal of becoming a national champion, Tuhabonye made a long-term plan to recover and return to an elite level. For months, he slowly increased the distance on the track and eventually started running again with the help of physical therapy. Years later, Tuhabonye earned a scholarship to run track for Abilene Christian University in Abilene, Texas, where he became an NCAA All-American and eventually a professional runner. Looking back on his journey and thinking about the insights he’s gained working with runners of all levels, Tuhabonye maintains the importance of accepting the conditions and fitness you’re in beforesetting goalsthat are meaningful to you. If you need some guidance on goal-setting, consider theSMART model—Specific, Measurable, Action oriented, Realistic, and Timed goals. If the SMART model doesn’t appeal to you (studies have shown it can cause heightened pressure and tension for some), open goals—non-specific and exploratory aspirations—are another good place to start. “Be yourself. Don’t try to be somebody else,” Tuhabonye says. “Have patience, have a measurable path, and you’ll get there.” As pro marathonerKeira D’Amatocan attest, sticking with the training and building on fitness over time is another key component of improvement. The last four years have been transformative for D’Amato’s running career, a journey she likes to think of in two acts. The first act was her college years; she raced for American University, where she became a four-time All-American. Post-college, D’Amatostruggled with injuriesand stopped running competitively after she had ankle surgery in 2009. After a seven-year hiatus from running, which included major life events, like getting married, having two kids with her husband, Anthony, and kicking off a career in real estate, D’Amato started the second act with an entirely new perspective. “I’ve lived these two separate lives of running, like one where I felt like I wanted so much. I was working hard in the wrong ways. I felt pressure, I was anxious,” D’Amato says. “Act 2, I’m more chill, more patient, and I’ve seen a lot more success in my personal bests.” This time around, the 2:19 marathoner learned there’s no magic workout that can help you get better. It all comes down to consistency in training. While workouts and long runs are important, one great workout won’t replace a solid week of quality running, D’Amato says. “Consistency, and what goes along with that is patience, unfortunately nothing happens overnight,” D’Amato says. “If you want to build in the right way, you break down your body and then recover, break down and recover, that process takes awhile.” Through the highs and lows, D’Amato also realized she’ll never regret going all-in on a goal. Even if she falls short, she still sees it as an opportunity to grow and ultimately get better as a runner. “When you know you’ve done everything you thought you should, there’s a peacefulness to that. When you don’t regret anything, that makes it easier,” she says. Bonus Tip:Incorporatinga range of workouts to your trainingcan help build speed and endurance while also keeping things interesting throughout the week. Long runs, recovery days,hill repeats, interval workouts, tempo runs, and fartleks are all key workouts that can benefit your performance in different ways. Training your mind is just as important as training your body for running,Vanessa Peralta-Mitchellsays. The certified run coach and founder ofGame Changers—an organization dedicated to bringing in more women of color as certified run coaches, leaders, and experts in the running industry—finds that incorporating a mental skills practice can be a huge help when it comes to reaching the next level. In determining areas of improvement, Peralta-Mitchell recommends starting with a mental clean slate, moving forward without any preconceived ideas of where you should be based on what you’ve done prior. “Sometimes that person you were before was great or sometimes it wasn't great, but it doesn’t matter,” Peralta-Mitchell says. “There are so many different things that brought you to that version of yourself. It’s a huge weight lifted to not take that on and just start anew.” From there, she suggests establishingaffirmations—statements that challenge negative thoughts and reinforce positive emotions—reflecting the latest version of you as a runner and the goals you’re looking to achieve. Peralta-Mitchell leans into positive phrases and avoids any negative-sounding words, like “don’t,” “won’t,” or “can’t.” The affirmation she’s using right now is “one woman, one goal,” a phrase she repeats in tough training sessions and races to stay present. In honing a mental skills practice, Peralta-Mitchell findsjournalingto be helpful. Keeping a consistent running journal not only helps you track training sessions and mileage, it can also help you process emotions and make key adjustments along the way. “The documentation is priceless and lets you have a record of what things work well and what things maybe you can try differently for next time,” she says. Staying healthy has helped propelLuis Ortato heights he never imagined when he started running as a 13-year-old growing up in Caracas, Venezuela. Over the years, the run coach and professional marathoner has broken national records, competed at world championships, and represented his home country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio. Looking back, Orta credits much of his rise to prioritizingstrength training, stretching, sleep, and taking the utmost precaution when it comes to injury. “My friends make fun of me because sometimes I have stopped running, and they ask me, ‘how much does it hurt?’ and I’m like, it’s a [level] one or a two,” Orta says about the importance of listening to your body’s cues if something feels off. “I just don’t want to risk it, and I don’t care about taking one or two more days off because it might make a difference in my training, but it will make a difference in me not getting injured. Maybe I exaggerate a little bit, but it’s kept me healthy.” With the exception of one injury that sidelined him for a month, Orta has been running healthy for almost 20 years. Now with many consistent training blocks behind him, he is chasing the Venezuelan national record in the marathon. In the spring of 2025, Orta aims to break 2:11:25.  Bonus tip:Arunning warmupand several minutes of dynamic stretching can expand your range of motion and also help prevent injury. Before your next workout, try incorporating a quick routine of warmup exercises. Doing dynamic stretches—think arm circles, inchworms, and hip openers—for at least 30 seconds each helps fire up the muscles before a hard effort. Elite runner and coachHiruni Wijayaratnestarted to see big gains when she committed to doing workout sessions with runners who were training at a higher level. Before recently moving to Miami, the Sri Lankan marathon record-holder lived in Boulder, Colorado, where she trained with the Rise Running Elite team, a pro group of marathoners led by coach Ric Rojas. In training, Wijayaratne often led the second-fastest group through workouts. But she aspired to be as quick as her training partners, Nell Rojas and Molly Grabill, who led the group ahead of her. During one training block, Wijayaratne started wondering how fast she could be if she tried to hang onto Rojas and Grabill’s paces. In a moment of curiosity, she committed to starting workouts with the pair. “The only choice I left for myself was you’re going to hang on and you’re going to hang on for as long as you can,” she says. “When you train with people that are better than you and you just kind of push yourself a little bit and take off the training wheels, there’s a lot of good that can happen on the other side.” While it was difficult at first, the strategy ultimately paid off. In the middle of a long track session, the 2:34 marathoner set a 4:53 personal best in the mile by sticking with Rojas and Grabill. “There’s magic to be found when you have the confidence to give yourself a shot to try and succeed,” she says.

18 Trail Running Tips to Add Adventure to Your Training,"Take your miles to the woods with this advice. If you lovenature, including being surrounded by trees, smelling the forest, and listening to the sounds of birds,trail runningmay be the gift that keeps on giving. You don’t even have to live in the country to find trails near you. Many cities have parks with paths through the woods, designed specifically for runners. If you’re new to running on trails, though, it does require some differentskillsthan hitting the road. To help you get started, we pulled together a list of our best trail running tips to help every level of runner. Yield to other trail users (equestrian, hikers, mountain bikers). Generally, downhill runners should yield to uphill runners because the effort to stop and restart on the uphill is greater, and downhill runners often have a better angle of vision. But when in doubt, just be kind and courteous regardless of whether you’re headed up or down. Stay on marked trails and run through puddles, not around them (making the trail wider). Leave no trace, and don’t litter. Everytrailhas its own unique terrain and challenge. There are groomed trails that are wide, limestone-based, and often even in surface, which make for a great introduction to running off the road. And there are narrow “singletrack” trails with a variety of obstacles, including tree roots, rocks, sand, hills, mud, and more. Singletrack trails tend to be more challenging, but they offer a dynamic running experience. Running off the road can be exhausting at first, especially in the early stages of training, and it may take you up to twice as long to cover a certain distance on a trail than it would if you were on the road. It’s wise to leave your ego at home,slow your pace, and focus on finding a new rhythm. Running on trails can also be a lot more demanding than the roads, especially if it’s a technical singletrack trail with roots, rocks, and other fun obstacles. Don’t compare your road pace to your trail pace, as you will be slower than your normal road-running pace. Instead, develop a trail tempo. Run by youreffort level, by yourheart rate, and by the tune of your body. For new trail runners, that may mean walking the hills and running the downhills and flats. No shame in that game. Slow build up to running hills, and you’ll prevent injury and burnout along the way. In a matter of weeks, you’ll berunning up hillsyou used to walk, and you’ll develop a sense of being one with the terrain. When heading out to the trails, bring a buddy or dog, if possible, or tell someone where you plan to run, which trails, and how long you expect to be out. Bring fuel, fluids, a trail map, ID, and cell phone with you for safety, and keep track of where you are along the trail as you go. If you run alone, download asafety appfor your phone or use a device with a safety feature, such as the Apple Watch, and always be mindful of what’s going on around you. It can be tempting to gaze at the nature around you, but doing so can quickly lead to tripping and falling. If you want to enjoy the sights, walk it out or stop; otherwise, focus on looking three to four feet ahead to create a line of travel, or where you going to step for the next few strides. This will keep you focused and in the moment—one of the true gifts of trail running. It’s as much of a physical puzzle as it is a mental one. You will begin to instinctively know where that line is as you become more comfortable running on the trails. Because the trails are more demanding, it’s wise torun by timeat first to gain a sense of your trail pacing versus heading out for a six-miler that might take you 40 minutes longer than expected. Running an out-and-back course is a great way to get to know your pace and develop your trail running confidence. From there, you can develop loops and routes to fit your needs. Adjust your pace according to the terrain and maintain a consistent effort level as you climb uphill. When in doubt, walk. Running over downed trees or through mud and sand takes some time getting used to, and it’s best to progress slowly. Tackling obstacles will get easier as your body gets stronger and more seasoned on trails. If you’re going to weave trail running into your life, it’s wise to invest intrail running shoes. They differ from road-running shoes in that they’re often beefier to handle rugged terrain but also lower profile (lower to the ground), which reduces the chance of ankle rolls with a high heel. The rugged tread offers better traction on muddy, wet trails. They should fit snug in the heel but have room in the toe box. Once you’ve got ’em, take care of them. After a wet or muddy run, remove the insoles, wash off the mud, and stuff with newspaper or paper towels to dry. Although many trails provide shaded routes, it’s still wise to wearsunscreen.Sunglasses, dark or light, will protect your eyes from tree branches and bushes.Wearing a hatand bug spray will help prevent insect bites and deter ticks. Grabbing somegaiterswill keep the dirt out of your shoes, too. Bringinghydrationwith you on a trail run is a must, as you never know how long it is going to take to complete the workout, or what kind of conditions you may encounter. There are three ways to carry fluids: handheld, multi-bottle waist belt, andhydration pack. Find what works best for you then grab it and go. For steep, hilly, or mountainous trails, consider using trekking poles to boost balance, reduce wear and tear on your body (four legs are better than two legs), and boost your hill-climbing strength. Using poles can reduce the total impact on the knees and hips. Plus, you can put rubber pieces on the sticks and use them on the roads, too. Take short, quick steps when going up hills and use your arms. Remember, some hills are meant to be walked, especially on the technical trails. (It’s common for ultrarunners to walk!) For gradual downhills on groomed trails, lean into thedownhill, open up your stride, and let the hill pull you down. For technical downhills or steep hills, it’s better to use a stair-stepping motion instead; move in a similar motion as you would running down a flight of stairs, keeping your torso tall and letting your legs to do all the work. Keep yourarms(elbows) a little wider for added balance on more technical trails with tree roots and rocks. Your stride is a little different than on the roads because you will need to clear rocks and tree roots, and lift your feet a little higher off the ground. You also may need to hop left or right to bypass things on the path like tree branches so pump with your arms as you move to maintain momentum. Just as runningintervalswill improve your speed, running obstacle repeats on the trail will help create new neuropathways in your brain and boost your technical trail-running skills. For example, warm up for 10 to 15 minutes, then find a relatively flat stretch of the trail and run repeats, focusing onform. Include optimal recovery as you would with a speed interval, start with shorter trail segments (20 to 60 seconds), and build to longer stretches (one to three minutes). Another way to improve your trail running performance is to include strength and balance exercises into your workout schedule two to three times per week. Include moves likelunges, single-leg squats, bridges,push-ups, deadlifts, calf raises, and using a wobble board or BOSU to develop foot andankle strengthand stability. It can be tempting to hit the trails frequently at first, but it’s wise to allow for adequaterecovery, as trail running—especially hilly, technical runs—will tax your body more than you may feel. When you run hard or long on the roads, you feel it, but when you run hard on the trails, you may not feel it as much, due to the more forgiving terrain. Make sure to weave in trail runs once per week at first, and then progress slowly by adding one trail run per week every two to three weeks. If you plan to run atrail race, aim to build up to running at least twice a week on trails (50 percent of your runs) and the rest on roads. Balancing the two will allow you to adapt to the new demands of the trail while maintaining the ability to run on harder surfaces withoutsoreness. Start with training on groomed trails, and progress to rugged trails once you have more off-road miles under your belt. There are a variety of ways to find trails, whether close to home or when you travel. There are several apps available, such asAllTrails, that will show you nearby trails run by other athletes. Or utilize resources such as theTrail Run Project. You can also connect with local running stores, forest preserves, and national parks to ask about the most commonly usedroutes. While you’re at it, make sure to ask about the specific nature of the trail, including wild animals, hazards, bathrooms, snakes, spiders, poisonous plants, and anything you may need to know when running in a new area.

Tested and Reviewed: Nnormal Kjerag,"Here’s what you need to know about the shoe ultrarunner Kilian Jornet wore for his 10th win at Sierre-Zinal. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Ultrarunner Kilian Jornet developed loads of running shoes with his sponsors in the past. But now he has his own brand, and he’s doing things his own way. He startedNnormalto combine performance with sustainability, making shoes that can stand atop podiums and stay out of landfills longer. The Nnormal Kjerag first made a big splash when Kilian wonHardrock, Sierre-Zinal, andUltra-Trail du Mont Blancall in the same pair of shoes. He logged more than 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) in that single pair. And for his 10th win at Sierre-Zinal, another pair of the Kjerag was on his feet. Most of the race shoes in the S/Lab Sense line that Kilian developed withSalomonwere on the minimal side. The Kjerag is much more forgiving than those other racers. I’ve found it protects my feet like a shoe that weighs 9 or 10 ounces. That’s partly due to the softer supercritical EVA Eexpure midsole. The supercritical foaming process is really the only thing keeping EVA in the game, as other foams swoop in with higher energy return. (Nnormal steered clear of PEBA due to its tendency to wear more easily.) It still feels highly responsive, but also surprisingly smooth. Additional underfoot protection comes from a woven TPU and nylon “ground filter”—a softer take on a rock plate. This prevents you from feeling every little stone underfoot, without impacting the flexibility of the shoe. The outsole also contributes to that extra protection, with full-coverage Vibram Megagrip Litebase rubber. The lugs are on the shorter side—3.5mm—in line with most of the variable-terrain trail shoes out there. While it still feels comfortable on pavement, and grips rocks and roots plenty, I found it can tend to slip out on smoother wet surfaces or mud. Runner-in-Chief Jeff Dengate loves the fit and shape of the Kjerag, which reminds him a lot of the oldMontrail Rogue Fly—a trail racing shoe made nearly 15 years ago that was little more than a racing flat with tiny nubs of rubber. But, one key difference between those two is that the Kjerag has a lower drop, making the shoe feel a little more jarring to him. Topowearers, familiar with the 5mm-and-below drops of many of that brand’s shoes, especially liked the underfoot setup. One told us the Kjerag has even knocked her Topos out of her shoe rotation, even though she had some trouble with the tongue. “It rubs my ankle if I’m wearing short socks,” she wrote. Rather than reach for longer socks, she’s going to trim the tongue—and make the tool suit her task.

5 Ways to Prevent Running Cramps,"These tried-and-true tips, backed by science, can keep you running long and strong.  Ask any of your running buddies how to handle pestering running cramps and they’ll probably give you genuine advice like drinkpickle juice, addsalttablets to your water, or eat abanana. And while none of that is necessarilybadadvice, the solution for cramps depends on the source of them—which even experts can’t pinpoint with certainty.“Scientists have theories, but it’s hard to do research on cramps because they’re unpredictable and spontaneous,” saysKevin C. Miller, Ph.D.professor at Texas State University's department of health and human performance, and a devoted cramp researcher. In fact, one of Miller’s early career tasks was to devise a humane way to induce cramps. (The process he came up with involves electro currents and students’ big toes—he swears it’s not too painful.) But even in a lab, multiple variables can be at play when a cramp occurs. “When I exercise, I losesodium, I becomedehydrated, and I becomefatigued,” Miller says. “The problem is all those things are happening at the same time, which makes it difficult to say definitively what’s responsible.” What experts do know is that many common treatments for running cramps have been proven ineffective, which means it’s time to rethink your treatment regimen. Here’s what you need to know to prevent leg cramps while running. Here are two common theories, backed by scientific research and experts. The best-known theory is also the one with the least amount of scientific support. In 2004,Timothy Noakes, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., a renowned exercise scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Cape Town, studied theelectrolytelevels of 43 ultramarathoners. Blood tests after a race showed no significant differences in bloodsodiumormagnesiumconcentrations between those who had and hadn’t cramped. There were also no differences in body weight, plasma volume, or blood volume between the two groups, showing thatdehydrationhad no real effect. Also, more recently, authors of astudypublished inthe Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research,found marathon runners who suffered from muscle cramps associated with exercise, didn’t exhibit a greater degree of dehydration or electrolyte depletion after a marathon but displayed significantly higher concentrations of muscle damage biomarkers. Miller agrees that dehydration alone is likely not to blame, because if that could cause amuscle cramp, he theorizes that you could seize up insaunasor hot tubs, or even just walking around on hot days. Dehydration, however, could expedite musclefatigue, and that is what Miller believes is a likely cause of cramps. In that ultramarathoner study, 100 percent of the runners who cramped did so in either the last half of or right after the race. Anecdotally, this theory holds up: Most people who cramp seem to be covering longer distances; cramps seem more common at mile 20 of amarathonthan, say, mile two of a5K, and cramps are more likely to happen after about an hour of activity. Additionally,speedier runnersseem to be at higher risk. Studies have shown that fast-paced ultramarathoners and triathletes had more cramps than their slower counterparts. So consider cramps a scream from your tired muscles that they need a break. Here are the best strategies for avoiding leg cramps while running: Guarding againstmuscle fatigueis key, so don’t take any shortcuts in training. “Train more, dolonger distances,” says Noakes, a former ultramarathoner. “You have to adapt to the distance you want to race.” This will help you stave off that point of fatigue. Miller recommendsplyometricsfor yourstrength-training workouts. These are explosive exercises that may improve the endurance of the receptors that are thought to misfire and cause cramps. If you trained logging 10-minute miles and you start racing 8:45-minute miles, your muscles won’t be prepared for that effort, and you’ll risk cramping, Miller says. Sopractice your pacingin yourrun workoutsand let that carry over into your races. Miller thinks cramps are often caused by the perfect confluence of factors. “If you tend to cramp up at 20 miles, write that down,” he says. “Then write down the conditions: Was ithot? Was ithumid? How much did you drink? What was yournutritionlike the night before? Were you acclimated to the heat?” Track patterns over time, and you may be able to figure out exactly what makes you cramp. While it’s unclear how much electrolytes will help with cramping, it doesn’t necessarily hurt to drink electrolyte-enhanced water instead of purewater, and onestudyin theJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,points out that it can be helpful. “This is likely because pure water dilutes the electrolyte concentration in our bodies and doesn’t replace what is lost duringsweating,” lead study authorKen Nosaka, Ph.D., director of exercise and sports science at Edith Cowan University, said in apress release. However,electrolyte drinksare most likely only needed for runs lasting longer than an hour. John Vasudevan, M.D. is an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Running Helps This Ultramarathoner Stay Sober and Give Back to His Community,"“Running has helped me overcome so many other obstacles in my life.” We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Name:Stan FlemingAge:46Hometown:Nashville, TennesseeOccupation:Case manager at Still Waters, a treatment center for people who struggle with addiction.Time Running:5 yearsReason for Running: Running has enhanced my sobriety on many levels and, of course, has given me an opportunity to give back. About five years ago, I was struggling to navigate mysobriety, and for help, I went to a fellowship and met Pastor Stan, who became my mentor. He invited me to his house and took me on a three-mile run. I wasn’t much of a runner at this point, but by the end, I felt really good—my body, my mind, everything. I instantly had a clear head. As time passed, I relapsed. But I eventually ran into someone who convinced me to give treatment another shot and helped me check intoStill Waters. There was a six-mile loop there, and Istarted runningit. In the beginning, I ran about three times a week, going short distances. But after some time, I was able to complete the full trail. After I left Still Waters, I made my way back to Massachusetts and joined theBoston Bulldogs, a run club that included people in recovery, and Coach Mike, founder of the club, asked me to run the Boston Marathon. In 2021, I trained and ran my firstmarathonin 3:33. That’s when I realized: Maybe I am pretty good at this running thing! I also ran theHarborside Halfin Newburyport, Masschusetts; theAustin Rattler Run, and many others, including a bunch of 5Ks. My experience with the Boston Bulldogs solidified my appetite for running, and I eventually decided to take my run into the woods and startedtrail running. A friend from Colorado talked to me about running through the Rockies, and I thought how cool would that be? In recovery, service is a big part of living your life. You want to look out for the new guy, and make sure they have the same opportunities as you did to get well. To have this love for running and racing, and then create an opportunity for other people, there’s no greater gift or higher honor in the world. That’s why I started theFighting Chance Project. We help underfunded people struggling with addiction get the treatment they need. My first race for the Fighting Chance Project was the 2023 Fall Creek Falls 100 in Tennessee. There is a cost associated with getting addiction treatment and not a lot of people have the financial stability to keep themselves enrolled in the process. The Fighting Chance Project helps provide financial aid for treatment. We have raised more than $100,000 this year, which means double for those looking for treatment, thanks to amatching program. To continue to raise money for Fighting Chance Project, I tackled theLife Time Leadville Trail 100 Runin August 2024. I hired a coach,Ryne Anderson, and used two three-month blocks to train. To help with our training regimen, we used Training Peaks and TrainRight. I trained about 10 to 15 hours a week. I also ran with Brian Williams, who became a Still Waters alum. He joined me for my recovery runs just about every weekend while I was at work. With two weeks left in his program, I asked him to pace me during the race. My nerves were quite high the morning of the race. I was confident in my training, but I had raised a lot of money and didn’t want to leave with a DNF. As soon as the gun went off, my worry seemed to vaporize, and it was finally time to run. I felt super strong, but remembered thatgoing out too hardin the beginning is a common problem of mine and was able to control my effort well. I battled throughblistersandstomach issues, but shortly before 10 a.m. on Sunday, with Brian, I crossed the finish line. Although getting through that night was one of the toughest things I’ve ever done, I’m beyond grateful my crew pushed me to finish. Running has helped me overcome so many other obstacles in my life. It has helped with mysobrietyand compassion for others. We think about running and getting in shape, or our bodies looking better and stuff like that, but I want people to know that the opportunity to give back has been one of the greatest blessings in my life. We can’t go from not running to running 10 miles a week. That seems to be the pattern for most—wanting instant results. It took a long time for mymusclesand tendons to build upstrengthandenduranceto support that kind of effort on my body. Be patient and results will follow. Whether a coach or a friend, find someone that has been running and has experience so you can get some advice. It’s nice to lean on others who can provide you with a sense of relatability. People can have a rough few days, and when you are there to help get them over the hump and move forward goes a long way to feeling good about yourself. →Altra Lone Peak Running Shoes: I love these shoes because they fit me perfectly, they don’t give me blisters, and they are insanely durable. →Garmin Fenix 5 Plus Watch: My watch keeps track of all of my data and is fairly easy for me to use, which is key because I’m not tech savvy! →Salomon Hydration Pack: This pack carries my water, all of my gear, and rests comfortably on my body.

The 11 Best Trail Running Shoes for Off-Road Runners,"We pick the top kicks for tackling off-road terrain. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Spring into warm weather by taking your run off-road to your local singletrack, rail trail, or fire road. There’s nothing wrong with celebrating the end of winter by pounding the pavement, but getting away from car traffic and smog can really maximize the zen of a daily run. Not only does trail running help clear your head, but the uneven terrain will keep your feet and ankles guessing,building strength with each step. Likewise, soft surfaces can helpreduce injury riskand allow you to run comfortably for longer stretches. Of course, you don’t want to get off on the wrong foot by wearing road shoes to a rocky, muddy route. Purpose-built trail shoes feature deeper treads called lugs, which claw into slippery surfaces to improve your traction on soft and uneven ground. Softer outsole rubber also provides better grip, and overbuilt uppers protect your foot against impacts and rolled ankles. We deployed our army of wear-testers to help you find the best trail running shoe for your next off-road adventure. Whattrail runningmeans to each of us is as varied and unique as the off-road terrain that we cover. To some, it’s a spiritual,transformative experience. But you don’t have to have a transcendentalist mindset or nirvana to qualify as a trail runner. To lots of us, running a short trail adjacent to a local park is simply an easy way to add extra miles onto a regular neighborhood loop. These benefits are equally legitimate, and they’re what inspire ultrarunners and weekend warriors alike to spend more time outside. Whatever your preference or personal ideology, we think everyone can be a trail runner, especially with the help of agood pair of shoes. The two main things to consider before purchasing trail running shoes are what type your feet need (think stiff or pliable, neutral or stable, wide or narrow, high or lowheel-to-toe drop) and what type of shoes the terrain demands. With the latter, try to think about whether the trails you encounter are technical or smooth, flat or steep, have loose or firm footing, and whether or not you cross water. Rigid shoes with deep lugs (5mm+) are best on technical trails with poor footing, but they’ll also be far less forgiving, even uncomfortable, on road runs. These shoes will serve you better on more rugged terrain and may work for day hiking as well. Hybrid shoes have shorter lugs (2mm to 4mm) and a softer on-road feel than their burly siblings. They're well-suited for soft singletrack and local wooded trails that don’t make you slow to a walk due to unsure footing.  Runner’s Worldhas provided expert advice and gear recommendations for all kinds of runners for more than 50 years. Our essential recommendations, including all kinds ofrunning shoes, are selected based on the data and insights gathered by our test team, who put the latest and greatest running gear through their paces day in and day out. In 2024, theRunner’s Worldtest team includes Runner-in-Chief Jeff Dengate, and test editors Amanda Furrer and Morgan Petruny. For the best trail shoes guides, the test team solicited additional recommendations from Production Manager Pat Heine, a veteran trail runner who tests off-road shoes, as well as veteran freelancers Dan Roe and Caitlin Giddings, who each have extensive shoe testing experience. In addition to our individual test runs, we leveraged the insights from theRunner’s Worldwear-test program, which recruits more than 275 runners of all abilities, ages, and sizes for real-world wear-testing on paved roads, dirt paths, and rocky singletrack trails. After a month of running more than 100 miles, these testers report their findings on features like fit, comfort, performance, and ride.  We recommended the best trail running shoes based on a wealth of experience and data gathered by theRunner’s Worldtest team, including down and dirty hands-on testing experience by our editors, data gathered by theRunner’s Worldwear test group, and additional research provided by our contributors. These shoes deserve special recognition because of their value and overall performance, both on foot and in the lab. Saucony’s most popular trail shoe rolls into 2024 with a new Pwrrun+ sockliner that adds cushioning to every step. The EVA-based Pwrrun midsole returns, delivering solid energy return so you aren’t trading pep in your step for grip off-road. We found the v14 builds on the Peregrine’s versatility for longer distances without sacrificing agility or responsiveness. The new design also has a redesigned mesh upper that adds more padding in the tongue and around the heel collar, which should help you get a snug fit at the ankle without pinching. It weighs a few tenths of an ounce more, but that’s not enough that you’ll really notice. These updates may feel minor, but that isn’t a bad thing. We’ve long enjoyed the Peregrine’s winning formula, which is just as suited for newbies’ first footprints on a muddy trail as it is for shielding vert-chasers’ toes on rock-strewn singletrack. And, it’s earned multiple awards from our team over the years for its versatility—across terrains, foot shapes, and distances—at a price that doesn’t break the bank. If you plan to run every day, rain or shine, the Peregrine 14 also comes in a“GTX” variantwith a waterproof Gore-Tex lining, which is ideal for keeping your feet dry when the skies open up on your trail adventure. Buy Men’sBuy Women’s Over the years, the Merrell Moab has evolved into the most popular and most sold boot in the world, and has spawned several variations. The Moab Flight, a low pared-down version of the original, gives trail runners a taste of the Moab action. A taller drop and stout build preserve some of that “fast hiker” feel, but also make the Flight more accessible to runners coming from high-offset road trainers like theBrooks GhostorAsics Gel-Kayano. The Flight uses none of the dense EVA foam found on the original Moab, and instead recruits Merrell’s new FloatPro midsole. The material feels lighter and softer, and relies on its thickness rather than a rock plate to add protection underfoot. It results in a burlier ride, but offers a seriously appealing amount of cush per dollar. (Testers only felt stones poking through the softer midsole on more rugged technical trails.) If you’re looking for a blazing-fast Merrell, we recommend the newMTL Skyfire 2. Buy Men’sBuy Women’s “This isn’t a workout or fast race shoe. This is the long-haul shoe,” one of our wear-tester declared of the Topo Athletic Ultraventure 3. According to one of our wear-testers,shoes with wide toeboxeslike the Ultraventure are perfect for ultrarunners. The outsole, made of grippy Vibram rubber, is more lightweight and sectional than that of the previous iteration. Its 3.5mm lugs are shorter and wider as well, making the shoe versatile for both roads and trails. “The Vibram outsole is sticky enough for rocky trails, but it’s not like a cleat,” said another tester. Even though the shoe doesn’t have a rock plate, the increased stack height—Topo added 5mm to the heel and forefoot—serves as a buffer on rugged terrain. The thicker midsole is composed of a new Zipfoam compound that’s lighter and more responsive than before. (It’s the same bouncy material used in Topo’sUltraventure Promodel.) To ensure stability, the platform was widened, too. Still, you’ll want to choose the brand’sMTN RacerorTerraventure, which have toothier treads, if you’re heading down gnarlier trails. Buy Men’sBuy Women’sFull Review Though the “GTX” distinction suggests ankle-high waterproofness, the material only reaches to the top of the laces. The gaiter collar is instead a stretchy fabric, preferable for shielding against small debris and light drizzle. Not suited for deeper creek diving, this construction does breathe easier. After splashing through shallow riverbeds and rain-filled potholes, no testers reported the soggy wet squish they’d sometimes feel after sealing their feet inside Gore-Tex. Interestingly, many runners will grab the GTX version for reasons other than waterproofness. The shoe’s outsole uses a different rubber than the non-GTX version. Nike finally made the switch to a stickier rubber. “The shoe performed wonderfully on all surfaces, especially the road,” said one tester, who put more than 120 miles on the shoe, equally split between road and trail surfaces. Buy Women’sFull Review TheSpeedgoatmight beHoka’smost popular trail shoe, but we think the overhauled Mafate Speed 4 is actually the better pick right now—especially if your trails require comfort and versatility. We found this out firsthand by using the shoe to race up and down Whiteface Mountain. With a wide range of trail options to pick from, the Mafate was our race day choice as we tackled the Olympic ski hill in New York’s Adirondack Park. It had more than enough bite on black diamond ski trails to let me claw my way uphill, and the cushioning protected my body when I had to dash back down 4,000 vertical feet over just 3.4 miles. Hoka made a number of key updates to make the Mafate Speed 4 a more runnable and comfortable shoe than its predecessors, including a new two-layer foam setup. The Profly+ midsole puts a lightweight, bouncy foam closest to your foot, which boosts comfort and makes the shoe feel alive when you’re running along hard-packed ground. The bottom layer is durable and firm enough to crush over sizable rocks and protect the bottom of your foot. When you get into steep or muddy terrain, the shoe still shines. The outsole has been redesigned and there’s more rubber underfoot. Each lug has three distinct tiers, giving you an enormous amount of sharp edges to cling to the ground. Plus, it’s Litebase, to help keep weight in check—Litebase makes the sole thinner and lighter, without diminishing traction. Buy Men’sBuy Women’sFull Review Brooks debuted the Catamount 3 trail racing shoe in early 2024, building on the success of the previous version’s lightweight and responsive, yet still protective midsole. The key upgrade comes in the form of a new single-layer engineered mesh upper, which delivers a comfortable, sock-like fit, while TPU overlays provide structure to keep your foot secure and protected. It fits a little snugger thanBrooks’ road shoes, but that’s a good thing here: A tight wrap will help you avoid rolling an ankle on rocky, uneven terrain. The Catamount 3’s SkyVault midsole plate enhances proficiency on the uphill, then smooths and stabilizes the ride on your descent, priming it for rolling trails. The plate’s rocker-style shape is curved in the forefoot to help propel you quicker off your toes on the ascents, and doubles as a rock shield. Testers found that theCatamount 2’soutsole, which returns in the Catamount 3, felt “super grippy” on wet logs and in freezing rain. They dug the energy return from the midsole (also unchanged in the new version), noting that they felt a “pop” on technical trails. Buy Men’sBuy Women’s The Altra Lone Peak gets tougher in 2024. The Lone Peak 8 adds an updated ripstop mesh upper, which includes ghillie lacing for a locked-in, customizable fit. TPU overlays keep your foot planted and protect your toes from impacts. Both of these upgrades should improve the shoe’s durability and performance in technical terrain. Altra doesn’t have to change much to keep the Lone Peak 8 in the trail shoe pantheon. It already had an award-winning midsole and outsole, both which return in the new design. Altra’s roomy, anatomical foot shape allows your toes to splay naturally. (It’s tough to really grasp how much your trail shoes may be jamming your toes together until you experience a natural fit like this.) Altra’s signature zero-drop designkeeps 25mm of cushioning beneath your foot in the front and back of the shoe, which takes some getting used to. Tread carefully if you’re coming from a 10mm drop shoe, which requires less flexibility in your foot and ankle. If you dig the wide shape and zero-drop design, though, you’ll be rewarded by immense traction and comfort. “The route I run most is a 4-mile loop on a mountain that has every kind of surface that one can expect to get in Pennsylvania—gravel, technical downhills, rocky climbs, and water crossings,” said one tester who put more than 150 miles on the previous version of the shoe. “This shoe grips all of it. The traction is fantastic, and the cushioning is ample, but still allows for ground feel and solid footing on rock.” Buy Men’sBuy Women’s Salomon’sSense Ridehas been a cult favorite among both beginners and longtime trail racers. Its firm, durable cushioning handles daily jogs and long runs comfortably, and the moderate heel-toe offset feels accessible to low-drop and high-drop runners alike. The Pulsar Trail has similar traits, but adds an energy-return boosting perk—a propulsive TPU plate thatSalomoncalls “Energy Blade”—for just a $10 price bump. Testers said the Pulsar feels slightly softer and more responsive than the Sense Ride, and praised its reliable traction and secure inner fit sleeve. “The cushioning is protective and bouncy, but not super plush. I didn’t feel sharp rocks underfoot and my turnover still felt fast,” said one tester who logs about 50 miles of road-to-trail running per week. “There’s a slick and mossy flat rock on the Warren Highlands trail that I test every trail shoe on. I’ve bit the dirt many times on it, but not while wearing the Pulsar. I felt super confident bombing down the descent.” Buy Men’sBuy Women’s With the originalTrailfly G 270(first released as the TerraUltra G 270), Inov8 debuted a new iteration of its Powerflow foam. The cushioning incorporates more TPU in the mix, which feels more forgiving while returning more energy to your stride. Sitting on top of that midsole is a fresh footbed to match. (Made from tiny compressed TPU beads, it’s more responsive than a regular foam or gel insole.) Together, these two elements combine for a ride that feels like a firm Salomon with some subtle bouncyAdidasBoost undertones—without losing good connection to the trail. That energetic midsole returns in version 2.0. In this update,Inov8focused on the upper, improving the overall stretch and breathability of the material to let your pinky toes splay and breathe easier. Testers told us the additional padding around the ankle collar also feels softer and locks down the heel more securely. Buy Men’sBuy Women’s The Bushido has been around for awhile, but it continues to earn a spot on this list. Why? This burly trail crusher brings plenty of structure and support to a responsive platform. But the outsole is what we like most—sticky, aggressive lugs line the perimeter and bottom of the shoe, making it easy to virtually grab hold of uneven terrain. We also appreciated the heavy-duty toe cap, which protects the foot should you kick into rocks. A breathable mesh upper and just the right amount of cushion in the midsole make this standout shoe versatile enough to manage long, slow mileage as well as speed workouts. Buy Men’sBuy Women’sFull Review While many VJ shoes, including theMaxxand theXTRM, are designed for obstacle course racing and trail running, theUltrais specifically designed for long-distance. It adds more cushioning underfoot, which feels lightweight yet ample for spending hours to days on the trail. The best part of VJ shoes is still the traction, though, and the Ultra lives up to the brand’s slogan, “#BestGripOnThePlanet.” The butyl-rubber outsole is studded with 4mm, chevron-shaped lugs, which give the Ultra a tacky hold on wet, jagged surfaces. “The traction this shoe had in all conditions was insane,” said one tester. “I ran these shoes through everything from bone-dry trails to monsoon summer rainstorms and was blown away—definitely the most grip I’ve had on a trail shoe, hands down. On short road stretches, the feeling is like walking across a dirty dive bar floor on a hot summer day—sticky.” Full Review What makes a great trail shoe? It depends on the trails and the runner, but you generally want to see thicker and softer outsole rubber than you find on a road shoe. The midsole may be made of a similar material, but it should include a rock plate (a plastic plate embedded in the foam) if your trails include sharp rocks and stones. For the upper, fit and protection are critical—you don’t want to roll an ankle as the shoe rotates about your foot, or break a toe from accidentally kicking a boulder. To prevent those misfortunes, trail shoes come with reinforced uppers in the form of TPU overlays at the midfoot and toe box. Do I need my trail shoe to be waterproof? Some trail shoes have lining made from Gore-Tex or a similarly waterproof material to keep your dry on wet trails. That sounds like a big benefit at a glance, but the reality is a little more complicated. There are pros and cons to wearingwaterproof running shoes. On the plus side, your feet will stay dry for longer when you're running through a rainstorm, which can help you avoid soggy feet and blisters. That said, even the most waterproof trail shoes will eventually get saturated in a downpour, and they don’t tend to drain as well once they do get wet. Also, waterproof membranes that keep moisture out will also lock moisture in: That keeps sweat vapor from escaping your shoes. No matter your approach, yourrunning socksare key for moisture management: Thin, synthetic materials dry out quicker and don’t hold as much water, meaning less added weight on your feet. What is shoe “drop?” If you’ve read shoe guides fromRunner’s Worldbefore, you may have noticed that we always highlight the“drop”of every shoe we recommend. Drop, or heel-toe offset, is the difference between the amount of material beneath your heel and your forefoot. For example, a shoe with 10mm of drop might have 25mm of foam and rubber beneath your heel and 15mm beneath your forefoot. Your feet may agree with a variety of drop measurements, but shoes with less drop require more flexibility in your foot and ankle. If you’re used to a 10mm drop shoe on the road and choose azero-drop shoefor the trails, be aware that your lower legs will be working harder until your feet adapt. That could pay dividends in the long haul as your feet and ankles get stronger and more flexible, but be wary of rushing the adjustment period.

Everything Masters Runners Need to Know About Running as You Age,"Experts explain why your body slows down and what you can do about it. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? In 2008, fresh into a new masters age group, I ran a 5K. Nothing unusual in that—I’d run spring 5Ks for quite a few years. The surprise was that I was 45 seconds faster than I’d been in any recent year. Age-graded, it was a massive PR. Short course, I thought, but a couple weeks later, I did it again, then twice more. Friends were wondering about my training. “What are you doing differently?” they asked. When I went back and looked at my training logs, the answer was surprising: I’d cutbackmy mileage. I’d done it simply because I was busy, but as the winter progressed, my speed workouts had responded. For masters runners, less is often more. Aging, like injuries, is one of those things most of us prefer to deny. “It’ll never happen to me,” goes the common decree. But as a non-running friend once said about her graying hair, “consider the alternative.” Eventually, we’re all either going to become masters runners...or not be runners. The options are limited. Internet fountain-of-youth claims notwithstanding, the passage of years does indeed affect athletic performance. TheAmerican College of Sports Medicinesuggests a depressing litany of time’s tolls: declining VO2max, reduced strength, increased body fat, reduced lactic acid clearance, declining bone density,  and more. Not to mention heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and declining mental acuity. Put these together and, according to data compiled byWorld Masters Athletics, runners slow about 7 percent per decade in their 40s, 50s, and 60s (and more quickly after that). The better we understand this process, the easier it is to beat the aging curve. Even if we merely reduce the rate at which the years affect our speed, that’s a victory—the runner’s version of aging gracefully. But it doesn’t take a total revision of training philosophy. “You don't have to do a lot different,” says Greg McMillan, M.S., exercise physiologist, running coach, and founder ofMcMillan Running. “The physiological reactions in the body and the adaptations you want to get are the same.” In other words, we merely have to modify how we do things, not what we do. Here, we take a look at what the science behind what happens to your VO2max, flexibility, muscle power, and recovery as you age. One indisputable effect of aging is declining aerobic horsepower. Classically, this is measured via VO2max—or your maximum rate of oxygen usage per unit of body weight. For sedentary people, VO2max typically declines by about 10 percent per decade after age 30. For athletes who keep in training, the rate of decline can often be held to about half that. Most runners associate this with reduced cardiac capacity. With age, there is a steady fall in the number of receptors in your heart muscle listening to the nervous system’s signals telling it how fast to beat. As the heart becomes increasingly deaf to these messages, its maximum rate drops about one beat per minute each year. There also appears to be a decline in the heart’s intrinsic ability to beat quickly. “It’s not so much that the heart can’t beat as quickly, though that’s probably true,” saysBenjamin Levine, M.D., founder and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. “The heart can’t relax as quickly. Out of all the factors that are probably an inevitable part of aging and not modifiable by training patterns, this is it. Our data have shown that masters athletes have youthful, compliant— or ‘stretchy’—hearts that fill well at low pressures. However, no amount of training was able to prevent the slowing of relaxation.” Many people simply presume that this decline in heart rate is the cause of age-related VO2max decline. But the reality appears to be considerably more complex. What counts is the ability of the heart to pump blood, and that’s comprised of two factors: heart rate and stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped with each beat). Inone study, Levine and colleague Darren McGuire had a unique opportunity to study the effect of 30 years of aging on a small cohort of ordinary individuals. (Other long-term studies had involved elite athletes, a group that might not be representative of the rest of us.) The study began in the 1960s, when five college students volunteered for three weeks’ total bed rest. Their catastrophic declines in aerobic conditioning are a major reason why nurses now prod surgical patients out of bed as quickly as possible. But before being put to bed, the young men were subjected to the type of testing normally reserved for elite athletes. Thirty years later, McGuire and Levine retested the same men in their early 50s. The follow-up study revealed that the intervening decades hadn’t been as hard on their VO2max values as the three weeks’ bed rest. Of greater interest, though, was the discovery that the men’s stroke volumes had increased. It was already known that this happens, as the heart enlarges to force blood through age-stiffened arteries. But nobody anticipated the magnitude of the effect. It turned out to be more than enough to compensate for the decline in maximum heart rate. A 50-year-old’s heart might not beat as rapidly as it once did, but it can pump at least as much blood per minute. What this means is that changes in VO2max aren’t entirely driven by changes in the heart. If the heart is delivering as much oxygen as before, but VO2max is declining, it must be that the muscles are becoming less adept at using it. What precisely is going on is a subject of considerable dispute. Partly, it’s simply that people lose muscle mass with age—smaller muscles use less oxygen. But other factors are probably also involved. Perhaps aging muscles have fewer capillaries to supply them with blood. Maybe they’re less able to call for blood when they need it. Or perhaps their cells have fewer mitochondria (the powerhouses in which oxygen is used). Perhaps their arteries become increasingly clogged or inelastic. A more complex theory comes fromTim Noakes, M.D., professor emeritus and former director of the Research Unit of Exercise Science and Sports Medicine at the University of Cape Town. He argues that for each stride, the aging brain may simply be using a lower fraction of the available muscle cells. Physiologists have long known that for any given movement, our nerves recruit only a fraction of each muscle’s fibers, letting the others rest. InLore of Running, Noakes suggests that as we age, our nervous systems may become more cautious about protecting our muscles from overload. (This is, however, an extremely controversial theory that has provoked outspoken dissent from other scientists.) Whatever the cause, the solution is fairly straightforward: run. Others believe speedwork factors into the mix (reducing the number of longer runs). “Train fairly hard at your 2-mile or 5K pace at least once a week, where you’re running your heart rate up to 98 percent of maximum,” saysBob Williams, Portland-based running coach “I'm a real believer in that.” McMillan agrees: “These are great things to include in your training program,” he says of 5K-paced workouts. “I wouldn’t say year-round, but frequently.”He also recommends racing frequently, perhaps once every three to six weeks, particularly 5Ks. “That’s a great VO2max workout in and of itself. The more I look at masters runners, the more I think you’ve got to keep racing. You almost go back toGeorge Sheehan. He was the king of racing every weekend. It doesn’t have to be 100 percent, and you can’t do long. The more 5Ks and 8Ks you can do, the better. This is completely different from what you’d advise for a 23-year-old who wants to go to the Olympics.” One of the people involved in McGuire and Levine’s study was Gregg Hill. At 20 years old, Hill was a college sophomore who ran a 4:45 mile. At the end of the follow-up study’s intensive training, his VO2max had been restored—but not the 4:45 mile. Clearly, aerobic capacity isn’t the only factor affecting masters performance. “What determines speed on the track is different from VO2max,” Levine says. Also cutting into your speed is a simple loss of range of motion—a problem most runners have faced since youth, but which intensifies with age. Part of the difficulty is the typical middle-aged lifestyle. McMillan notes that many masters-age runners spend a lot of their work lives sitting at their desks or in meetings. “We’ve risen to a level [in our jobs] that can be bad for us,” he says. ""We’re doing a lot of things that don’t have us moving. That’s the worst thing we can do from a flexibility standpoint.” Once your muscles start to get tight, you’re limiting your power base, according to Williams. “You’re not going to be able to move as smooth and efficiently.” The solution is stretching. The idea is to get blood flowing through the connective tissues, best done by stretching them dynamically before the workout, and statically afterward. Williams generally has runners do 15 to 20 minutes of dynamic drills while warming up. In particular, he says, dynamic exercises should focus on your calves, hamstrings, and hips. But stretching isn’t the only thing that can help retain or restore flexibility. “Use a foam roller four to five days a week,” Williams says. “Or get a massage every week or two. The foam roller seems to be the primary tool I’ve found that keeps competitive runners healthy.” Tension release$30 | REIBuy Now Ice without the mess$30 | AmazonBuy Now Relieves stiffness$349 | HypericeBuy Now Promotes circulation$1495 | AmazonBuy Now Deep-tissue massage$129 | Roll RecoveryBuy Now Alternatively, if you want to retain flexibility but don’t want it to feel quite so regimented, Williams suggests trying some other sport that works your range of motion. Williams suggests tennis, but pretty much anything is better than nothing, even golf. “There are a lot of things you can do,” he says. “You don’t need a gym.” McMillan agrees. Experiment with different types of flexibility training, he says. “As a masters runner, you’ve got to investigate and find the methods that work.” [Run faster, stronger and longer with this 360-degree training program.] Another indisputable side effect of aging is a decline in muscle mass. According to theAmerican College of Sports Medicine, muscle strength and mass begin decreasing at age 40, with the process speeding up after age 65 or 70. Of particular concern to runners, the loss generally occurs fastest in the lower body. The rate of loss appears to be faster for fast-twitch fibers than for slow-twitch. That’s a greater problem for sprinters than for distance runners, but it should be of concern for everyone because it’s possible to lose all of your fast-twitch fibers. And when that happens, nobody knows how to get them back. Scott Trappe, Ph.D., director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University, was the head of the team that made this discovery. The likely reason, he said at the time, is changing lifestyles. As people age, particularly into their 70s and 80s, they stop doing the high-intensity activities that call for fast-twitch fibers. The result is that these fibers atrophy until they’re gone—permanently. “The body is going to react to demands,” adds Brown. “If you don’t demand it any more—if you think, ‘I’m too old to do this, and I’m not strong enough anyway,’ then you’ll start to lose muscle mass.” The solution is vigorous weight training at whatever weight you can handle—and fancy gym machines aren’t necessary. Rubber tubing, free weights, stretchy bands, calisthenics— any of those can help. “As long as you’re doing something two or three days a week to push yourself to a point where you’re saying, ‘This is starting to get pretty hard,’” Williams says. The best masters runners never stop, adds McMillan. “They seem to be always training and racing—that may help,” he says. “The initial research was showing that if you just keep with it, you can reduce that loss of muscle composition.” None of these approaches works if you push too hard, too often. “All the evidence I read doesn’t suggest that you can actually slow the aging process,” Noakes says. “In contrast, I think you can accelerate the aging process if you overdo the exercise.” For younger athletes, he thinks overdoing it is running more than about two hours a day. But many masters runners find that it takes longer than it once did to recover from workouts and races. Lots of factors may be involved, but the simplest to understand is at the cellular level, where tissue repair and replacement simply don’t occur as rapidly as they once did. What this means is that as you age, you may have to experiment with changing your workout pattern. According to McMillan, masters runners need to do every type of workout that younger runners do, but they may need to alter their schedules. And they may need to allow more time to adapt. Stick with speedwork, a tempo run, and a long run each week but space them out. “ That’s going to be different for every runner,” he says.  Masters runners also need to be careful to allow enough recovery time after races. In the end, you can’t turn back time, but if you learn how to train smarter—not harder—as you age, there’s still a great chance you can nab a few more PRs.

Molly Seidel Might Always Be a Work in Progress. She’s Totally OK With That.,"She stunned the world (and herself) with Olympic bronze in Tokyo. Then life went sideways. How America’s unexpected marathon phenom is getting her body—and brain—back on track. On a clear December night in 2019, Molly Seidel was at a rooftop holiday party in Boston, wearing a black velvet dress, doing what a lot of 25-year-olds do: passing a joint between friends, wondering what she was doing with her life. “You should run theOlympic Trials,” her sister, Izzy, said, as smoke swirled in the chilly air atop The Trackhouse, a retail shop and community hub on Newbury Street operated by the running brand Tracksmith. “That would be hilarious if you did that as your first marathon.” Molly, an elite10Kracer who’d spent much of 2019 injured, looked out at the city lights, and laughed. Why the hell not? She’d just qualified for the trials, winning the San Antonio Half with a time of 1:10:27. (“The shock of the century,” as she’d put it.) True, 13.1 miles wasn’t 26.2—but running amarathonwas something to do. If only because she never had before. A four-time NCAA track and cross-country champion at The University of Notre Dame in Indiana, Molly had moved to Boston in 2017, where she’d worked three jobs to supplement her fourth: running forSaucony’s Freedom Track Club. The $34,000 a year that Saucony paid her (pre-tax, sans medical) didn’t go far in one of America’s most expensive cities. Chasing kids around as a babysitter, driving around as an Instacart shopper, and standing around eight hours a day as a barista—when you’re running 20 miles a day—wasn’t ideal. But whatever, she hadcompression socks. And she was downing free coffee and paying rent, flying to Flagstaff, Arizona, every so often for altitude camps, and having a good time. Doing what she loved. The only thing she’s ever wanted to do since she was a freckly fifth-grader in small-town Wisconsin clocking a six-minute mile in gym class. “I was hustling, and I loved it. It was such a fun, cool time of my life,” she says, summarizing her 20s. Staring into Molly’s steely brown eyes, listening to her speak with such clarity and conviction about her struggles since, it’s easy to forget: She is still only 29. After Molly had hip surgery on her birthday in July 2018, her doctors gave her a 50/50 chance of running professionally again. By summer 2019, she’d parted ways with FTC, which left her sobbing on the banks of the Charles River, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and uncertainty. Her biggest achievement lately had been being named #2 Top Instacart Shopper (in Flagstaff; Boston was big-time). Subscribe to our newsletter for exclusive access to more great stories about running! The day after that rooftop party, Molly asked her friend and former FTC teammate Jon Green, who she’d newly anointed as her coach: “Think I should run the marathon trials?” Sure, he shrugged. Nothing to lose. Maybe it’d help her train for the 10K, her best shot—they both thought—at making a U.S. Olympic team. “I’m going to get my ass kicked six ways to Sunday!” she told the host of the podcastRunning On Omsix weeks before thetrials in Atlanta. Instead, on February 29, 2020, she kicked some herself. Pushing past 448 of the fastest, most-experienced women marathoners in the country, coming in second with a 2:27:31, earning more in prize money ($60,000) than she had in two years of racing—and a spot on the U.S. trio for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, along with Kenyan-born superstarsAliphine Tuliamukand Sally Kipyego. “I don’t know what’s happening right now!” Molly kept saying into TV cameras, wrapped in an American flag, as stunned as a lottery winner. Saucony who?Pumacame calling. Along with something Molly hadn’t anticipated: the spotlight. An onslaught of social media followers. And two weeks later, a global pandemic and lockdown—and all the anxiety and isolation that came with it. She was drowning, and she hadn’t even landed in Tokyo yet. The 2020 Olympics,as we all know, were postponed to 2021. An emotional burden but a physical boon for Molly, in that it allowed her to get in a second marathon. InLondon, she finished two minutes faster than her debut. When the Olympics finally rolled around, she was ready. Before the race, Molly says, “I was thinking: ‘Once I cross the starting line, I get to call myself an Olympian and that’s a win for the day.’” But then she crossed the finish line—with a finger-kiss to the sky and a gutturalYesss!—inthird placewith a 2:27:46, just 26 seconds behind first (Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir). And realized: She gets to call herself an Olympic medalist forever. Only the third American woman to ever earn one in the marathon. Lots of kids have fleeting hopes of making it to the Olympics. I remember thinking I could be Mary Lou Retton. Maybe FloJo, with shorter fingernails. Then I decided I’d rather be Madonna or president of the United States and promptly forgot about it. But Molly held tight to her Olympic aspirations. She still has a poster she made in 2004, with stickers and a snapshot of her smiley 10-year-old self, to prove it. “I wish I will make it into the Olympics and win a gold medal,” she wrote, and signed it: Molly Seidel, the “y” looping back to underline her name. In case there was any doubt as to who, specifically, would be winning the medal. Molly grew up in Nashotah, Wisconsin, and is the eldest of three. Her sister and brother, younger by not quite two years, are twins. Izzy is a running influencer and corporate content creator for companies like Peloton; and Fritz favors Formula 1 racing and weightlifting and works for the family’s leather-tanning business. The family was active, sporty. Dad, Fritz Sr., was a ski racer in college; Mom, Anne, a cheerleader. You can tell. Watching clips of Molly’s mom and dad watching the Olympic race from their backyard patio, jumping up and down, tears streaming, is the kind of life-affirming moment you wish you could bottle. “I’m in shock. I’m in disbelief,” Molly says into the mic, beaming. “I just wanted to come out today and I don’t know…stick my nose where it didn’t belong and see what I could come away with. And I guess that’s a medal.” When the interviewer holds up her family on FaceTime, Molly breaks down. “We did it,” she says into the screen between sobs and smiles. “Please drink a beer for me.” Molly hasn’t alwaysbeen unabashedly herself, even when everyone thought she was. A compartmentalizer to the core, she spent most of her life hiding a huge part of it: anorexia, bulimia, anxiety, obsessive-​compulsive disorder, debilitating depression. It started around age 11, when she learned to disguise OCD tendencies, like compulsively knocking on wood, silently reciting prayers “to avoid God getting mad at me,” she says. “It was a whole thing.” She says her parents were aware of the behaviors, but saw them more as odd little habits. “They had no reason to suspect anything. I was very high-functioning,” she says. “They didn’t realize that it was literally taking over my life.” She wasn’t officially diagnosed with OCD until her freshman year of college, when she saw a therapist for the first time. At Notre Dame,disordered eatingtook hold, quietly yet visibly, as it does for up to 62 percent of female college athletes, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. As recently as the Tokyo Olympics, she was making herself throw up in the airport bathroom, mere days before taking the podium. Molly hesitates to share that detail; she fears a girl might read this and interpret it as behavior to model. “Having been in that place as a younger athlete, I know I would have,” she says. But she also understands: Most people just don’t get how unrelenting eating disorders can be. In February 2022, she finally received a diagnosis of the root cause for all of it: ADHD. About being diagnosed, she says, “It made me feel really good, like [I don’t have] a million different disorders. I have a disorder that manifests itself in a lot of different symptoms.” She waited to try Adderall until after the Boston Marathon in April, only todrop outat mile 16 due to a hip impingement. Initially, the meds made her feel fantastic. Focused. Free. Until she realized Adderall hurt more than it helped. She couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, lost too much weight. Within weeks, she devolved. “The eating disorder came roaring back,” she says, referring to it, as she often does, as its own entity, something that exists outside of herself. That ruthlessly takes control over her very need for control. “I almost think of it as an alter ego,” she explains. “Adderall was just bubblegum in the dam,” as she puts it. She ditched the drug, and her life—professionally, physically—unraveled. In July 2022, heading into the World Championships, she bombed the mental health screening, answering the questions with brutal honesty. She’d been texting Keira D’Amato weeks prior. “Yo girl, things are pretty bad right now. Get ready…” Sobbing on the sidewalk in Eugene, Oregon, she texted D’Amato again. And the USATF made it official:D’Amato would take her spot on the team. Then Molly did what she’d been “putting off and putting off”— checked herself into eating disorder treatment for the second time since 2016, an outpatient program in Salt Lake City, where her new boyfriend was living at the time. Somehow (see: expert compartmentalizer) mid-meltdown, in February 2022, she had met an amateur ultrarunner named Matt, on Hinge. A quiet, lanky photographer, he didn’t totally get what she did. “I didn’t understand the gravity of it,” he tells me. “I was like, Oh she’s a pro runner, that’s cool. I didn’t realize she was, like,thepro runner!” Going back to treatment “was pretty terrible,” she says. At least she could stay with Matt. Hardly a honeymoon phase, but the new relationship held promise. “I laid it all out there,” says Molly. “And he was still here for it, for all the messiness. It was really meaningful.” And a mental shift. “He doesn’t see me as just Molly the Runner.” Almost a yearlater, on a freezing April evening in Flagstaff, Molly is racing around Whole Foods, palming a head of cabbage, grabbing a thing of hummus, hunting for deals even though she doesn’t need to anymore. “It’s all about speed, efficiency, and quality,” she says, explaining the secret to her earlier Instacart success. She checks the expiration date on a container of goat cheese and beelines for the butcher counter, scans it faster than an Epson DS3000, though not without calculation, and requests two tomato-and-mozzarella-stuffed chicken breasts. Then she darts over to the beverage aisle in her marshmallow-y Puma slip-ons that Matt custom-painted with orange poppies. She grabs a case of La Croix (tangerine), then zips to the checkout. We’re in and out in under 15 minutes and 50 bucks, nothing bruised or broken. Other than her body. Let’s just say: If Molly were an avocado or a carton of eggs, she probably wouldn’t pass her own sniff test. The week we meet, she is just coming off a month of no running. Not a single mile. She’s used to running twice a day, 130 miles a week. No wonder she’s spraying her kitchen counter with Mrs. Meyer’s and scrubbing the stovetop within minutes of welcoming me into her new home. The place, which she shares with Matt and his Australian border collie, Rye, has a post-college flophouse feel: a deep L-shaped couch draped in Pendleton blankets, a bar cluttered with bottles of discount wine, a floor lamp leaning like the Tower of Pisa next to a chew toy in the shape of a ranch dressing bottle. Scattered about, though, are reminders that an elite runner sleeps here. Or at least tries to. (“Pro runner by day, mild insomniac by night” reads the bio on her rarely used account on what used to be Twitter.) There’s a stick of Chafe Safe on the coffee table. Shalane Flanagan’s cookbooks on the counter. And framed in glass, propped on the office floor: Molly’s Olympic kit—blue racing briefs with the Nike Swoosh, a USA singlet, her once-sweat-drenched American flag, folded in a triangle. “I’m not sure where to hang it,” she says. “It seems a little ostentatious to have it in the living room.” With long brown curls and a round, freckly face, Molly has an aw-shucks look so innocent that it’s hard, at first, to perceive her struggles. Flat-out ask her, though—How are you even functioning?—and she’ll tell you: “I’m an absolute wreck. There’s no worse feeling than being a pro runner who can’t run. You just feel fucking useless.” Tidying a stack of newspapers, she adds, “Don’t worry, I’ve had therapy today.” She’s watched every show. (SaveTed Lasso, “too sickly sweet.”) Listened to every podcast. (Armchair Expertis a favorite.) She’s got nothing else to do but PT and go easy on the ElliptiGo in the garage, onto which she’s rigged a wooden bookstand, currently clipped withA History of God: The 4,000 Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. “I don’t read running books,” she says. “I need something different.” Like most runners—even the most amateur among us—running, moving, is what keeps her sane. “What about swimming? Can you at least swim?” I ask, projecting my own desperation if I were in her size 8.5 shoes. “I fucking hate swimming,” says Molly. Walking? “Oh, yeah, I can go on walks. Another. Long. Walk.” The only thing she has on her schedule this week is pumping up a local middle school track team before their big meet. The invitation boosted her spirits. “Should I just memorizeMiracle on Ice?” she says, laughing. “No, I know, I’ll doIndependence Day.” Injuries are nothing new for Molly. Par for the course for any professional athlete. But especially for women, like her, who lack bone density—and have since high school, when, according to a study in theOrthopedic Journal of Sports Medicine, nearly half of female runners experience period loss.Osteoporosisand its precursor, osteopenia, are rampant in female runners, leading to ongoing issues that threaten not just their college and professional running careers, but their lives. Still, Molly admits, laughing: She’s especially accident-prone. I ask her to list every scratch she’s ever had, which takes her 10 minutes, and goes all the way back to babyhood, when she banged her head against the bathtub spout. There was a cracked spine from a sledding incident in 8th grade, a broken collarbone from a ski race in high school, shredded knee cartilage in college when a driver hit her while she was riding a bike. “Ribs are constantly breaking,” she says. In 2021, two snapped, and refused to heal in time for theNew York City Marathon. No biggie. She ran through the pain with a 2:24:42, besting Deena Kastor’s 2008 time by more than a minute and setting the American course record. Molly’s latest injury? Glute tear. “Literally a gigantic pain in the ass,” she posted on Instagram in March. Inside, Molly was devastated. Pulling out of the Nagoya Marathon—the night before her 6:45 a.m. flight to Japan, no less—was not in the plan. The plan, according to Coach Green, had been simple. It always is. If the two of them even have one. “Just to have fun and be consistent.” And get a marathon or two in before the Olympic Trials in February 2024. She’d been finally—finally—fit on all fronts; ready to race, ready to return. She needed Nagoya. And then, nothing. “It feels like I’m back at the bottom of the well,” says Molly, driving home from Whole Foods in her Toyota 4Runner. “This last year-and-a-half has been so difficult. It’s just been a lot of doubt. How do I approach this, as someone who has now won a medal? Like, man, am I even relevant in this sport anymore?” She pops a piece of gum in her mouth. I wait for her to offer me some, because that’s what you do with gum, but she doesn’t. She’s so in her head. “It’s hard when you’re in the thick of it, you know, to figure out: Why the fuck do I keep doing this? When it just breaks my heart over and over and over again?” We pull into her driveway. “I was prepared for the low period after Tokyo,” she says. “But this has been much longer and lower than I expected.” The curse of making it to the Olympics, let alone coming back with a medal: expectations. Molly’s own were high. “I think I thought, after the Olympics, if I win a medal, then I will be fixed, it will fix everything.” Instead, in a way, it made everything worse. That’s the problem that has plagued Molly for most of her running career: Her triumphs and troubles intermingle, like thunder and lightning. Which, by the way, she has been struck by. (A minor backyard-grill, summer-thunderstorm incident. She was fine.) The next morningin Flagstaff, Molly’s feeling like she can run a mile, maybe two. It’s snowing, though, and she doesn’t want to risk the slippery track, so we meet at Campbell Mesa Trails. She loops abandaround the back of her truck to stretch and sends me off into the trees to run alone while she does a couple of laps on the street. Molly leaves for an acupuncture appointment, and we reunite later at Single Speed Coffee (“the best coffee in Flagstaff,” promises the ex-barista who drinks up to three cups a day). We curl up on a couch like it’s her living room, and she talks as freely—and as loudly—as if it was. Does she realize everyone can hear her? She doesn’t care. I guess that’s what happens when you’ve grown so comfortable sharing—in therapy, on podcasts, in a three-part video series on ADHD for WebMD—you just…share. Loud and proud. Mental illness is so insidious, says Molly. “It’s not always this Sylvia Plath stick-my-head-in-a-fucking-oven thing, where you’re sad all the time,” she says. “High-functioning depressed people live normal successful lives. I can be having the happiest moment, and three days later I’m in a total downward spiral.” It’s something you never recover from, she says, but you learn to manage. “I’m this incredibly flawed person who struggles so much. I think: How could I have won this thing when I’m so flawed? I look at all the people around me, all these accomplished people who have their shit together, and I’m like, ‘one of these things is not like the other,’” she says, taking a sip of her flat white. “I was literally in the Olympic Village thinking: Everybody is probably looking at me wondering: Why the hell is she here?” They weren’t. They don’t. She knows that. And yet her mind races as fast as she does. It takes up So. Much. Space. When she’s running, though, the noise disappears. She’s not Olympic Molly or Eating Disorder Molly, she’s not even, really, Runner Molly. “When I’m running,” she says, “I’m the most authentic version of myself.” Talking helps, too. Molly first shared her mental health history a few years ago, “before she was famous,” as she puts it. After the Olympics, though, she kept talking and hasn’t stopped. The Tokyo Games were a turning point, she says. Suddenly the most revered athletes in the world were opening up about their mental health. Molly credits Simone Biles’s bravery for her own. If Biles, and Michael Phelps and Naomi Osaka, could come clean... then maybe a nerdy, niche-y, unlikely medaling marathoner could, too. “Those guys got a lot more shit for it than I did,” says Molly. “I got off easy. I’m not a household name,” she laughs. She knows she can be candid and off the cuff—and chat freely in a not-empty café—in a way Biles never could. “I’m a nobody!” she laughs. Still, a nobody with 232,000 Instagram followers whom she has touched in very IRL ways—becoming an unintentional poster woman for normalizing mental health challenges among athletes. “You are such an incredible inspiration,” @1percentpeterson posts, one comment of a zillion similar. “It’s ok to not be ok!” says another. Along with all the online love is, of course, online hate. Molly rattles off a few lowlights: “She’s an attention-seeking whore,” “Her bones are so brittle she’ll never race again,” “She’s running so badly and posting a lot she should really focus on her running more.” Molly finds it curious. “I’m like, ‘If you hate me, you don’t need to follow me, sir.’” It’s Molly’s nobody-ness—whatOutsidewriter Martin Fritz Huber called her “runner-next-door” persona, and I’ll just call “genuine personality”—that has made her somebody in running’s otherwise reserved circles. Somebody who (gasp!) high-fives her sister in the middle of a major race, as she did at mile 18 of the 2021 New York City Marathon. “They shat on me in the broadcast for it,” she says. “They were like, ‘She’s not taking this seriously.’” (Except, uh, then she set the American course record, so…) Somebody who, obviously, swears like a sailor and dances awkwardly on Instagram, who dresses up like a turkey, and viral-tweets about getting mansplained on an airplane. (“He starts telling me how I need to train high mileage & pulls up an analysis he’d made of a pro runner’s training on his phone. The pro runner was me. It was my training. Didn’t have the heart to tell him.”) Somebody who makes every middle-aged mom-runner I know swoon like a Swiftie and say: “OMG! YOU HUNG OUT WITH MOLLY SEIDEL!!?” Middle-aged dad-runners, too. “I saw her once in Golden Gate Park!” my friend Dan fanboyed when he heard. “I waved!” Did she wave back? “She smiled,” he says, “while casually laying down 5:25s.” And somebody who was as outraged as I was that I bought a $16 tube of French toothpaste from my hip Flagstaff motel. (It was 10 p.m.! It was all they had!) “For that price it better contain top-shelf cocaine,” she texted. Lest LetsRun commenters take that tidbit out of context: It’s a joke. It’s, in part, what makes Molly America’s most relatable pro runner: She’s not afraid to make jokes. (While we’re at it… Don’t knock her for smoking a little legal weed, either. That’s so 2009. Per the World Anti-Doping Agency: Cannabis is prohibited during competition, not at a Christmas party two months before it. Per Molly: “People would be shocked to know how many pro runners smoke weed.”) I can’t believeI never asked to see it. Molly’s medal. A real, live Olympic medal. Maybe because it was tucked into a credenza along with Matt’s menorah and her maneki-neko cat figurines from Japan. But I think it was because hanging out with Molly felt so…normal, I almost forgot she’d won one. People think elite distance runners have to be one-dimensional, she says. That they have to be sculpted, single-minded, running-only robots. “Because that’s what the sport has been,” she says. Molly falls for it, too, she says. She scrolls the feeds, sees her fellow pros living seemingly perfect lives. She wants everyone to know: She’s not. So much so that she requested we not print the photos originally commissioned for this story, which were taken when she was at the lowest of lows. (“It’s been...refreshing...to be pretty open and real with Rachel [about] the challenges of the last year,” she wrote in an email toRunner’s Worldeditors. “But the photos [were taken at] a time when I was really struggling and actively trying to hide how bad my eating disorder had become.”) Molly finds the NYC Marathon high-five thing comical but indicative of a more serious issue in elite running: It takes itself too seriously. It’s too…elitist. Too stilted. “Running a marathon is a pretty freaking cool experience!” If you’re not having fun, she asks rhetorically, what’s the point? Still, she admits, she isn’t always having fun. Though you wouldn’t know it from her Instagram. “Oh, I’m very good at making it seem like I am,” she says. She used to enjoy social media when it was just her friends. Before she gained 50,000 followers in a single day after the trials, and some 70,000 on Strava. Before the pandemic, before the Olympics. Keeping up with content became a toxic chore. “You feel like you’re just feeding this beast and it’s never going to stop,” she says. She’s taken to deleting the app off her phone, reloading it only to fulfill contractual agreements and post for her sponsors, then deleting it again. As much as she hates having to post, she enjoys plugging products the only way that feels natural: through parody. As does Izzy, her influencer sister, who, like Molly, prefers to skewer rather than shill (à la their idea behind their joint Insta account: @sadgirltrackclub). “The classic influencer tropes make me want to throw up,” she says (perverse pun as a recovering bulimic not intended). “New Gear Drop!’ or ‘This is my Outfit of the Day!’ Cringe. “Hot Girl Instagram is not how I identify,” she says. Nor is TikTok. “Sponsors tell me all the time:You should TikTok!I’m like, ‘I amnotdoing TikTok.’ I know how my brain works. They’ll say, ‘We’ll pay you less if you don’t’—and I’m, like, I don’t care.” And to those sponsors who ghosted her after she returned to eating disorder treatment, good riddance. Michelob went silent, she says. “Whatever. You have watery-ass beer anyway.” To those who have stood by her, though, she’s utterly devoted. Pissed she couldn’t wear the Puma panther head to toe in Tokyo, Molly took off her Puma Deviate Elites and tied them over her shoulder, obscuring the Nike logo on her Olympic singlet for all the world to see. Or not see. “Nike isn’t paying my fucking bills.” The love is mutual, says Erin Longin, a general manager at Puma. After decades backing legends like Usain Bolt, Puma was relaunching road running and wanted Molly as their guinea pig. “She’s a serious athlete and competitor, but she also has fun with it,” says Longin. “Running should be fun. Molly embodies that.” At their first meeting, in January 2020, Molly made them laugh and nerded out over their new shoes. “We all left there, fingers crossed she’d sign with us,” says Longin. Come February, they all flipped out. Longin was watching the trials, not expecting much. And then: “We were all messaging, “OMG!!” Then Molly killed in London. Medaled in Tokyo. “What she did for us in that first year…” says Longin. “We couldn’t have planned it!” Then came the second year, and the third, and throughout it all—injuries, eating disorder treatment, missed races, missed opportunities—Puma hasn’t flinched. “It’s easy for a company to do the right thing when everything is going great,” Molly posted in April, heartbroken from her couch instead of Heartbreak Hill. “But it’s when the sh*t hits the fan and they’re still right there with you….” She received 35,000 hearts—and a call from Longin: “You make me feel so proud.” Does it matter to Puma if Molly never places—never races—again? “Nope,” Longin says. My last afternoonin Flagstaff, it’s cloudy skies, still freezing. I find Molly on the high school track wearing neoprene gloves, black puffy coat, another pair of Pumas. Her breath is white, her cheeks red. Her legs churning in even, elegant strides. Upright, alone, at peace, backed by snow-dusted peaks. Running itself is what matters, not racing, she tells me. “I honestly don’t give a shit about winning,” she says. All she wants—really wants, she says—is to be healthy enough to run until she’s old and gray. Molly’s favorite runner is one who didn’t get to grow old. Who made his mark decades before she was born: Steve Prefontaine. “Pre raced in such a genuine way. He made people feel something,” she says. “The sports performances you truly remember,” she adds, “are the ones where you see the struggle, the work, the realness.” Sounds familiar. “I hate conversations like, ‘Who’s the GOAT?’” Molly continues. “Who fucking cares? Who’s got the story that’s going to get people excited? That’s going to make some kid want to go out and do it?” I know one of those kids: My best friend’s daughter, Quinn, a rising track phenom in Oregon, who has dealt with anxiety and OCD tendencies. She has a picture of Molly Seidel, and her times, taped to her bedroom wall. This past May, Quinn joined Nike’s Bowerman Club. She was named Oregon Female Athlete of the Year Under 12 by USATF. She wants to run for Notre Dame. “Quinn loves running more than anything,” her mom tells me, texting photos of her elated 11-year-old atop the podium. “But I don’t know…” She’s unsure about setting her daughter on this path. How could she not, though? It’s all Quinn wants to do. Maybe what Quinn, too, feels born to do. It’ll be okay, I tell her, I hope. Quinn has something Molly never had: She has a Molly. Molly and I catch up via phone in June. A team of doctors in Germany has overhauled her biomechanics. She’s been running 110 miles a week, feeling healthy, hopeful. Happy. A month later, severe anemia (and accompanying iron infusions) interrupts her summer racing schedule. She cancels the couple of 10Ks she had planned and entertains herself by popping into the UTMB Speedgoat Mountain Race: a 28K trail run through Utah’s Little Cottonwood Canyon—coming in second with a 3:49:58. Molly’s focus is on the Chicago Marathon, October 8th; her first major race in almost two years. Does it matter how she does? Does it matter if she slays the Olympic Trials in February? If she makes it to Paris 2024? If she fulfills her childhood dream and brings homegold? Nah. Not if—like Matt, like Puma, like, finally, even Molly herself—you see Molly the Runner for who she really is: Molly the Mere Mortal. She’s the imperfect one who puts it perfectly: What matters isn’t her time or place, how she performs on the pavement. Or social media posts. What matters—as a professional athlete, as a person—is how she makes people feel: human.

The 7 Best Running Headphones for Jamming on Your Jogs,"We put the best to the test to find the right fit, sound, and sweat-resistance for runners. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.Why Trust Us? Headphones have become just as essential in the runner’s toolkit asrunning shoes, afitness tracker, or asmartwatch. For the most part, runners looking for headphones generally choose in-ear models, including truly wireless earbuds and neckband earbuds with a wire or band connecting them. They stay in place far better than over-ear headphones, and often have features made with exercise in mind, like ear hooks and sweat-resistant materials. These are the best running headphones we here atRunner’s Worldhave tried—buds we’ve worn well-past testing on all kinds of runs, including marathons. Runner’s Worldeditors have been testing gear tirelessly for over 50 years. That means a lot of miles in a lot of shoes—mid-run music has become a godsend for plenty of us as we tap out our favorite loops day after day. In short, we review products with a focus on finding the best tech for avid runners. Every pair of earbuds we test meets the same criteria before it ends up in one of our reviews. We’re not just throwing Airpods on this list because everyone has them, for example—we eschewed including the latest version because we like thesecond Pro generationmore for their snug fit. In a similar fashion, all the other buds we recommend here are here because we’ve run with them, sweat all over them, toyed with their fit, and ultimately enjoyed them. Nobody else contributes to our decision-making process, especially not the brands we’ve picked. TheRunner’s Worldtest team is constantly listening to music, podcasts, you name it, as we try running shoes,shorts, and everything else. Our team loves music; we evenconducted a test on whether a song’s beat can influence your running pace. Our watches and smartphones haverunning playlists for every kind of runwith music. We also play podcasts and audiobooks to test different kinds of sound quality—and catch up on true crime or “read” celebrity memoirs. Besides downloading a range of genres to listen to, we also evaluate fit, sound quality, and battery life as we test earbuds and comb testers’ feedback to determine the best headphones for this list. Our testers log long runs—and marathons and ultramarathons—wearing their earbuds and taking note of how many times they have to charge them per week. We also test sweat-resistance and comfort after prolonged in-ear use, putting in hours of running through all kinds of weather to also gauge water- and wind-resistance. For waterproof models, we plop them in a cup full of water to check if they’re still in working order (and so you can squash those fears of replacing your buds after an accidental puddle drop or spin cycle). The earbuds on this list checked off most or all of the above characteristics. Become a Runner’s World+ member for exclusive access to product testing opportunities! The main draw of bone-conduction headphones is safety—because they project soundwaves directly through your skull into your eardrums, they don’t need to plug your ears, which leaves them open to take in all the ambient sound around you. In other words, the open-ear design allows runners to listen to their playlists while also being aware of their surroundings, such as traffic. Shokz is the most recognizable bone conduction headphone brand with good reason. Even though the sound quality isn’t as crisp as that of in-ear earbuds, the Shokz headphones have the brand’s TurboPitch feature, which we’ve found boosts the bass enough to offset the tinniness that you sometimes get with earbuds that allow too much airflow. The headset is lightweight—only 1 ounce— and requires only an hour-long charge for 10 hours of battery life. Another plus is the comfort factor— the open-ear ’phones won’t cause skin irritation after prolonged use. Fair warning: If you have piercings around the helix or conch of your ear, you might experience some discomfort in these headphones, because the main pads that compress your head sit right behind your ears. It’s initially a weird sensation regardless, but the potential pain from contact with these piercings could be a dealbreaker. If we had to pick a single set of running headphones from Apple, we’d grab the Beats Fit Pro. They take everything we love in theAirPods 3andBeats Studio Buds, and they cram it all into a tiny set of buds with ear wings to help them stay put. No matter how sweaty we got during testing, these didn’t budge. They also didn’t ache when we got up to an hour or 90 minutes of running, which is roughly when the discomfort of ill-fitting buds starts to snowball. We enjoyed these earbuds’ delightful tactile buttons. They require just a light press to play/pause, two presses to skip, three to go back, and a long press to activate active noise cancelation and transparency modes or Siri. It’s easy to use, and there’s no fumbling for small buttons. The coolest feature, however, is one you might have never considered—spatial audio. When you turn your head, the audio rotates so it sounds like the music is still coming from the same direction, just as the sound would change when you swivel your head at a real concert. It’s trippy at first, but you won’t actually trip while you’re running—we got used to the feature quickly. But it’s not just neat audio effects at play here—the sound is remarkable for small headphones. Thanks to an H2 chip and amplifier, the second generation of the AirPod Pro has noticeably deeper bass and clearer, louder sound than the original. Plus, you can customize the spatial audio—by taking photos of your head and ears—so the sound is tailored to how you would naturally hear. It’s a neat trick— swivel your head and the focal point shifts. It’s like you’re actually in a room with live music. Other improvements make these great for your daily workouts. Transparency mode, in particular, works far better with less of the digital crackle you get when wind passes over the microphones that pump in external audio. To be fair, we’ve found there’s still some wind noise, but you completely forget about it after the first quarter mile or so of your run. Plus, there’s none of the “thump, thump” you get from other sealed earbuds every time your foot hits the ground. At this point, we ought to acknowledge that there is a third generation of the standard AirPods out, but we still rank the Pro 2 buds higher because of their superior in-ear security—the 3s don’t have rubber ear tips and simply can’t handle the same repeated shocks. Read Full Review Director of Product ContentWill Egensteinersaid these buds’ lack of ear wings initially made them feel insecure, but they stayed put nicely during runs without generating a noticeable “thud” at each foot strike. However, working up a sweat caused a slight rubbing noise where the silicone tip sealed in the ear. That seal wasn’t so tight as to prevent him from hearing his surroundings—a plus for outdoor running. But because of that, the sound wasn’t as immersive, and the battery life wasn’t on par with that of the other models. But it’s tough to argue with inexpensive, truly wireless earbuds that offer modest water-resistance, quick and easy pairing, a charging case, and a built-in microphone to take phone calls—plus a full two-year warranty. Test editorAmanda Furrerhas long rocked the (now-discontinued) Jabra Elite 75t—they’re still going strong even after she accidentally ran them through her washing machine—and has found these to be a familiar, yet improved, replacement. The Elite 8 Active, touted as “the world’s toughest earbuds,” passed nine durability tests that met U.S. Military Standards for rugged electronics, according to Jabra. At a demo in New York, Furrer was told to plop them into an 8-ounce glass of water before popping them back into her ears. The Elite 8 Active can be submerged down to 5 feet. You can’t listen to music during a swim because Bluetooth does not work well underwater, but you can rest assured the earbuds will continue to work properly after being dropped in a rain puddle. Sticky silicone “ShakeGrip” keeps these locked in your ear canal no matter how sweaty you get, without the need for hooks or wings. The earbuds have six microphones, which are great for phone calls, but also power the active noise cancelation and transparency features. The Elite 8 Active’s standout feature, however, is Dolby Audio. Spatial and 6mm speakers provide a more nuanced sound experience as you run. Think of it as having a mini music hall by each ear. It was tester Kendra Petruny’s first time running with open-ear earbuds when we gave her 1More’s S50 to test. She usually wears Apple Airpods on her runs, but checked to see if the S50 would fall out when she cartwheeled (they stayed put). The ultimate test, however, was wearing them while racing a half marathon. Petruny was happy to report the S50 didn’t budge. The volume could have been a little louder, she said. However, she appreciated how the open-ear style allowed her to hear the crowds’ cheers as she ran. The buds have an impressive IPX7 rating, meaning the electronics shouldn’t be affected by a heavy downpour or your sweat. The battery life is also good for up to 11 hours on a single charge, making this pair ideal for ultras. One problem with plenty of dedicated running earbuds is one you can see from a mile away: They tend to be bulky, especially if they have ear hooks. If that’s not your style, or you want buds that will play nice with a wider variety of headwear, we recommend looking for options that sit more flush with your ear. Enter the Jaybird Vista 2 earbuds. Not only do these earbuds barely stick out of your ears, but they also come in an exceptionally tidy carrying case that’s easy to stow away on long runs if you want to charge them or take a break from your tunes. The Vista 2 lasts eight hours on a single charge—long enough to get you to the finish line of your next 26.2—and two hours longer than the original Vista. Plus, you’ll get an additional 16 hours with the charging case. This update preserves the same earbud shape, with a secure fit that seals out dust and moisture. Speaking of moisture, the sweat- and waterproof Vista 2 improves to a rating of IP68 from the first version’s IP67. Double-tap (don’t press) to change between Active Noise Canceling (ANC) and SurroundSense (ambient noise pass-through) modes. Though our best overall pick, theShokz OpenRun Pro, uses a wraparound band to hold itself in place on your head, the majority of other headphones use two systems to stay in place: in-ear tips and external ear hooks. In the best case, both are an effective means of keeping your buds in or on your ears during a turbulent run, but plenty of runners have a strong preference for one or the other. Let us spell out some key differences for you. These buds have neither connecting wires nor hooks that extend around your ear; you just push them in and go. This design tends to fit snug in the ear canal to stop it from loosening midrun. The compact style makes them lightweight, and their small batteries can mean more frequent charging. However, all of our test models came with charging cases that allow you to juice them up on the go. Truly wireless earbuds also tend to be the most expensive. Over-ear hooks take some pressure off the ear canal to hold these buds steady. Adding a hook can improve an earbud’s fit, too, since there’s a second point of contact to hold it in place. The hook can also store antennae or a battery, helping these buds play longer than their truly wireless counterparts. They’re often marginally cheaper than truly wireless models, but some will cost more than $200 anyway. The best running headphones will fit comfortably, so you can think about your run and not your aching ears. That fit also affects how much outside sound is let in—there’s no ideal balance for everybody. Some runners like buds that fit deep in their ears and block all outside noise, allowing them to crank up the tunes, while others prefer lots of environmental sound from a looser fit. The latter fit is safer for running outside and among other people. Because earbuds that isolate you from the outside world should provide clear sound, we expected better sound quality from earbuds that fit snug in the ear than we did from earbuds that let in a lot of noise. It’s becoming more common, however, for the best running headphones to offer an ambient sound mode, which uses the earbud’s microphone to bring in outside noise while maintaining a tight fit. While we test each pair of running earbuds for at least two weeks—some far longer—we don’t typically encounter quality issues. But we ask our testers to discuss how the earbuds felt—you’d expect a $200 set of buds to feel premium compared to a $40 pair. For long-term quality assessment, we checked user reviews from Amazon and other retailers to identify any persistent issues. Plus, we update our findings here if any issues crop up as we continue to run with these models. None of our testers had issues with water or sweat ruining their buds, but with long-term use, moisture and salt can destroy earbuds that aren’t capable of repelling it. So, we factored in each device’s IP, orIngress Protection, rating. The rating consists of two numbers. We also ask testers to evaluate how quickly and easily the buds connected to their phones, and how far they were able to get from their phones before the signal cut out. In addition, we recorded any mid-run connectivity issues. To assess battery life, we checked manufacturers’ claims against our testers’ experiences and noted discrepancies where they occurred. We’ll continually update this roundup with our test impressions of the best earbuds for running. Tell us what you think about your buds in the comments. How do you listen to music and run phone-free? As a loyal Garmin user, I recommend using models like theForerunner 245 Musicor theForerunner 965, which I’m currently wearing. The latter has more features if you’re a multi-sport, stats-junkie, but the price is significantly higher. The watches allow you to sync with music providers, such as Spotify. Most earbuds, with the exception of Apple Airpods, areGarmin compatible. How do you pair wireless earbuds to your Garmin? Fellow test editor Morgan Petruny offersa helpful guide on pairing your earbuds to devices. Here’s her instructions on pairing them to you Garmin: How do you clean earbuds? For a deep clean, fill a glass with a drop of dish soap in half a cup of warm water. Remove the foam or silicone tips from the earbuds, and let them soak in the soap mixture for 30 minutes. Use a cotton swab or Q-Tip to remove excess particles. Allow the tips to air dry before screwing them back on. Use a clean old toothbrush to gently scrub the actual earbuds, mesh cover pointed down.

"He Finds Homes for Overlooked Shelter Dogs, 1 Run at a Time","Wesley Swainston connects pup-lovers across the country with their new best friend. Around 5:30 p.m., after Wesley Swainston finishes his work with the Marine Corps, he heads toAdoption First Animal Rescue, a shelter in Jacksonville, North Carolina. After spending the majority of his day managing aircrafts in the sky as an air traffic control officer, Swainston volunteers as a trainer helping rescue dogs improve their chances of getting adopted. With a leash in hand, Swainston heads to the kennels and picks out adogto run with. Some dogs are full of energy while others are more timid and need encouragement to get out the door. Some can run for the entire 1-mile loop around the shelter, and others will only make it halfway. But no matter the distance, the dogs always finish the run happier. For the past year, Swainston has shared these miles on social media in hopes of getting more dogs adopted, and the effort is paying off. Since the secondvideo went viralin March—a point-of-view reel that shows Swainston running with rescue dogs Cindy, Rooster, and Hondooo while sharing training tips and the personality traits of each animal—most of the dogs he’s featured on Instagram have found new homes. “There’s a lot of good that comes out of [running with shelter dogs],” Swainston tellsRunner’s World. “Being able to connect with a dog is just a lot easier when you prioritize their physical exercise before coming in there and asking them to sit and stay and all of the commands that owners are looking for when adopting a dog.” Five years ago, Swainston started running to get himself in shape for training in the Marine Corps, which requires recruits to pass aninitial strength testthat includes running 1.5 miles in 13:30 or less (9:00-mile pace). Now an active duty Marine for the last four years, Swainston kept running because he appreciates how the sport makes him “stronger mentally.” So far, he’s competed in five marathons and ultramarathons. About a year ago, the Jacksonville resident, who also works as a part-time dog trainer, decided to combine his passion for running with his love forcanines. He quickly learned the animals were calmer and happier if they exercised prior to training. “The benefits to running with your dog are immense—the bond, getting their exercise out so they’re more able to work with you, especially in the chaotic shelter environment,” he says. In November 2023, Swainston posted a video on Instagram of him running with shelter dogs that were being overlooked at the rescue center. By describing each animal and the techniques he uses to connect with them individually—exercise, quality time, and treats, for example—Swainston hopes to “show people what the dog could be,” he says. Late last year, Swainston was deployed to Norway and wasn’t able to continue working at the shelter while overseas, but he picked it up again once he returned home in the spring. After the video in March gained a lot of attention online, Swainston created a separate Instagram account dedicated to his runs called@runningwithshelterdogs. Through the platform, Swainston has connected with people around the country who are interested in adoption, often pairing them with dogs that have a tougher time finding homes. Earlier this month, he partnered with wheelchair athleteJesi Stachamto help raise awareness for Crispy, a dog who came to the shelter with her two back legs paralyzed. Crispy was later adopted after thevideowas posted. Swainston has also encouragedother runners to start volunteeringat their own local shelters. Along with getting more dogs adopted, his ultimate goal is to create an in-person and virtual community of people giving their time to animals in need. And he’s not slowing down any time soon. Later this month, Swainston plans to run a full marathon with 26 dogs (one mile with each dog) at Adoption First. “There’s no cooler feeling than posting a video and because of that video, a dog gets its forever home,” Swainston said.
