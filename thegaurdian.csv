"‘Inspiring, courageous’: Nedd Brockmann completes epic 1,000-mile charity run","Nedd Brockmann’s 1,000-mile (1,609km) charity run has been dubbed “Australian of the year type shit” by Dylan Alcott, the wheelchair tennis star who won the award in 2022, after the runner completed his challenge at 6.17am on Wednesday. Alcott’s message of support to Brockmann is one of dozens from Australia’s athletic and celebrity elite celebrating the end of his arduous near-two-week run in which he averaged 128km per day around an athletics track at Sydney Olympic Park. The 25-year-old hasraised more than $2.6m for Australians experiencing homelessness, although his time could not beat the 1988 world record set by Greek ultra runner Yiannis Kourous of just under 10 and a half days. Brockmann finished his run in 12 days, 13 hours, 16 minutes and 45 seconds – around half a day behind Bryan Smith’s Australian record set at the 1998 Nanango 1000 Mile Track Race – and burst into tears after crossing the finish line. The epic run was live streamed on TikTok as “Nedd Brockmann’s Uncomfortable Challenge” and viewed more than 4.7 million times across 50 countries, while as many as 2,000 people gathered to watch his final night of running from the grandstand at the athletics track. Afterwards, Brockmann revealed a left shin injury in August hampered his preparation, and rain on day two triggered damage to his feet. “From then, just trying to get up in the morning, ripped so bad – my toes looked like King Charles’ fingers,” he said. An injury to his right shin on day three, as well as subsequent problems with his left shin and right knee made running almost impossible, and Brockmann had to take injections to reduce swelling. “From day five onwards it was a downwards spiral, trying to just hold on,” he said. Television presenter Hamish Blake said on Instagram: “It started as a world record about time. It grew into the world championships of never giving up. And Nedd, you finished undisputed.” Surfer Mick Fanning said Brockmann’s achievement brought a tear to his eye. “You’re a selfless man. Inspiring, courageous and real. Utmost respect,” he said. And Alcott added: “Australian of the year type shit. Give the man what he deserves. Unbelievable effort brother.” Swimmer Shayna Jack, AFL player Jeremy Cameron, and Wallaby Taniela Tupou all expressed their admiration for the electrician from western NSW, in response to a video posted on Instagram after Brockmann finished which has been liked more than 180,000 times.

Brockmann has had to endure substantial discomfortduring the event, and had to be ferried to and from the track in a wheelchair. He would barely sleep a few hours each day due to his schedule and the pain in his legs. His feet swelled three shoe sizes and he developed severe blisters due to the grip of the track and the sheer load of the run, significantly more than the 100km per day he covered in his 2022 run from Perth to Sydney. Vice president of the Australian Ultra and Trail Runners Association, Corrina Black, said Brockmann’s run highlighted that ultra running can be for anyone, and he has showed grit and tenacity. “It’s opened up the doors and highlighted that anyone can be an ultra runner and just need to put one foot in front of the other,” Black said. “If you can use your running at the same time to motivate others and to raise money for charity, it’s a win all round, isn’t it?” Brockmann earlier raised $1.85m forWe Are Mobilise, an outreach program combatting homelessness, with a 46-day run of 4,000km across Australia in 2022."
"‘Pain is worthwhile’: cult hero Nedd Brockmann defies agony in 1,000-mile charity run","Australian ultra marathoner has run 1,300km in 10 days at Sydney Olympic Park as he raises $1.3m for people experiencing homelessness As night closed in on Nedd Brockmann’s quest to run 1,000 miles (1,609.3km) in 10 days, the loneliness of Australia’s favourite long-distance runner could be felt by every member of a 1000-strong crowd who crowded into Sydney Olympic Park on Sunday to cheer him home. The former tradie turned endurance athlete was in agony – and frequently, in tears. By 5pm on the 10th night, Brockmann, 25, from the New South Wales central west, had covered 1,322.62km. He had run every day for 16-20 hours a day around a 400-metre athletics track. He had raised over $1.3m in donations for charity. But his body was failing him. “Nedd has been in pain every day of this challenge,” said support team leader James Ward. “He’s got issues with his shins, knees, shoulders. It’s got to the point where he needs us to put him in a wheelchair every morning to get him on the track. But so long as the donations keep coming in, he thinks all the pain is worthwhile.” By Sunday, the blisters on Brockmann’s feet were raw and bleeding. Despite wearing shoes three sizes too large to combat the discomfort, there were times he could barely walk, let alone run, in his effort to meet the astonishing target of four marathons every day. “It is so relentless that track … it has been hell … and that’s why I love it,” Brockmann told his followers in a social media clip. By then his “Uncomfortable Challenge” had drawn 2.7m views to TikTok for what did prove uncomfortable – yet undoubtedly inspiring – footage. Brockmann had his eyes on a record set by the greatest ultra runner of all time,Yiannis Kouros, who ran 1,000 miles in 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds in New York in 1988. It was a typically audacious target and, by Sunday, it looked out of reach. But with the crowd cheering from the bleachers, Brockmann soldiered on. “The record might be out of reach for Nedd but he’s not stopping,” said Ward, who met Brockmann in 2020 when the 21-year-old sparkie ran 50 marathons in 50 days to raise more than $100,000 for the Red Cross. “Nedd is an incredible character. When he hit $1.3m in donations today he burst into tears. Then he kept on running.” Brockmann first captured the hearts of the nation in 2022 with an extraordinary 46-day run of 4,000km across Australia that raised $1.85m forWe Are Mobilise, an outreach program combatting homelessness. Six weeks after he set off in Western Australia, a crowd of over 10,000 people cheered the cult hero across the line at Bondi beach. This challenge was shorter but steeper – and far more gruelling. “Yiannis Kouros’s feat of endurance is simply mindblowing,” Brockmann had written on Instagram ahead of setting out. “However, if you’re going to do something, don’t go in half-assed, throw everything at it. Everything.” This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Brockmann has been mostly running at night to avoid the heat, and sleeping by day, and stuck to a strict refuelling schedule. His mother, Kylie, and father, Ian, have been cheering his every step, and boxing champion Harry Garside and comedian Hamish Blake have turned up at the track to run beside him. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion On day eight, with with the record slipping away, Brockmann changed tactics. Instead of tackling each 100-mile (161.1km) in 20-hour blocks virtually non-stop over a day, he began to work in “17-hour sessions”: running big miles, resting a few hours, then going again. With 12 hours to go, Brockmann needed to run 280km by Monday 14 October at 3:30am AEST (and 35 seconds) to claim the world record. But the record paled before the higher cause of raising money for the homeless. “He’s had 20,000 individual donations so far, mostly Mums and Dads and kids, rather than big corporations,” reckons Ward. “He’ll keep going into Tuesday, even Wednesday, until he hits 1,000.” Beyond 1,000, Brockmann is encouraging workplaces, schools, gyms and groups of friends to embark on their ownuncomfortable challengefor charity in coming weeks. “This isn’t just about endurance or attempting to break a world record – I want it to be a rallying cry for people who want to have a crack, to stand together, and make a difference,” Brockmann said. Brockmann’s attempt has been streamed onTikTok Live."
‘I’m motivated by the puzzle’: how Courtney Dauwalter became ultrarunning’s GOAT,"Dauwalter does not have a coach, a strict training plan or a Strava account, but the 38-year-old is widely considered ultrarunning’s greatest of all time In 2023, CourtneyDauwalter became the first person, male or female, to win the Triple Crown, the three most iconic 100-mile races in the world, in a single season. Ultrarunning, with races ranging from 50km to 250 miles, is defined by type-A personalities: meticulous, rigid, detail-oriented, even obsessed. Courtney Dauwalter, 38, is the exception to the rule. Dauwalter does not have a coach or a strict training plan. She’s never been on Strava and doesn’t plan races far ahead of time. She runs in long shorts and baggy clothes because, she says, they are more comfortable. She eats candy while training and drinks beer afterwards, because that’s what makes her the most happy. “My diet is to eat the things that look good in quantities that feel good,” said Dauwalter. “My fuel tank is based on joy. If I’m happy, the engine works way better.” While her philosophy may sound casual, the results say otherwise. In the last decade, Dauwalter has won more than 50 ultras, often in dominant fashion, and is widely considered the greatest of all time. Over the summer of 2023, Dauwalter became the first person, male or female, to win the Triple Crown in the same season. The triple consists of Western States 100, Hardrock 100, and UTMB, three of the most grueling, competitive and iconic ultras in the world. Only one other athlete, Kilian Jornet, has won all three in the span of an entire career. Yet, despite a barrage of accolades, Dauwalter says winning the Triple Crown didn’t change her outlook at all. “I don’t think of it as an inflection point. I don’t think about any of my wins that way. No race is perfect. There is always something to do differently next time. I always hope to finish a race knowing I gave everything I had that day, but be able to tinker. I’m motivated by the puzzle.” The puzzle, so to speak, is her secret to success. Like most highly successful people, Dauwalter is motivated by the process, not the results. However, her process is anything but traditional. “After I wake up, I have two cups of coffee and go through an informal full body assessment,” Dauwalter explains. “Where’s my head? How are my feet? How are my lungs and what is my stress level? I listen to what my systems are saying, before I do anything else.” Without a coach or set training plan, Dauwalter trains entirely on feel. Her days are structured loosely, which allows for adaptability. She makes decisions intuitively, like how many hill repeats to run or how big her loop should be that day. “After checking in, I make an idea of what workout I’m going to do. As I head out on my run, I keep doing the system checks to see how I’m feeling as I start moving. If I feel good I may hit the gas pedal, if I don’t I might hit the brakes.” Dauwalter started this year with a win at Transgrancanaria 126k in February and followed it with a win at Mount Fuji 100 in April. In July she won Hardrock for the third year in a row, but claims that none of these races were as easy as she would have liked. “After last summer I was more tired than I’ve ever been, so I took a lot more time off than usual. I usually take about a month, but I took a lot of months to chill,” says Dauwalter. “I was exhausted physically and mentally.” The longer break meant she lost more fitness, which made her return more challenging. “I ran Transgrancanaria in 2023, so it was easy to compare the two races. It was a lot harder this time,” says Dauwalter, despite winning by more than an hour. After winning Mount Fuji, Dauwalter felt like she was back on track. “Training was going well and I felt good going into the race, but Hardrock was one of those days that the gears didn’t line up. In the first few hours I knew it wasn’t going to be smooth. Everything took a little more effort than it should have, so I just kept reminding myself to be patient and to let time be our friend.” Still, Dauwalter broke her own course record by two and a half minutes. She hopes to race again this fall, but doesn’t know which race it will be. “I’m just enjoying as much as possible right now, not thinking about what comes next. Instead of trying to predict the next chapter, I just want to live in this one.” This wasn’t always Dauwalter’s philosophy. She had never heard about ultrarunning – let alone thought about being a professional – until she was in her twenties. “Growing up you see this progression in front of you. You play the board game of Life and learn you’re supposed to follow the steps,” says Dauwalter. “I believed in a linear path. Choosing ultrarunning was like turning onto a side road. That’s when I realized I was writing my own book.” In 2017 she left her full-time teaching job to take a chance on ultrarunning. “It was just a hobby so choosing it full-time was kinda crazy. I didn’t have a way to help pay for bills at the house, but I didn’t want to be 90 and wonder ‘what if?’” This type of curiosity was formed as a kid. Growing up in the suburbs outside Minneapolis, Dauwalter was part of a close-knit, active and hard-working family. “The grades were always less important than if we tried our hardest,” Dauwalter says. “My parents emphasized that if we were going to do something, we should give it everything we had.” As the middle child, Dauwalter was close with both of her brothers. “We went to the same school, through the same phases, and even shared a car together,” Dauwalter jokes. “We all played on the same soccer team and they didn’t treat me differently because I was a girl. They never lowered the bar for me.” In seventh grade Dauwalter joined the cross-country team, which quickly became her biggest passion. In her first year she made the varsity team and qualified for the state meet. “We had amazing coaches all the way through high school. The guys and girls teams trained together, like a family of best friends.” Dauwalter’s coaches fostered a culture around working hard, but not at the sacrifice of fun. “I remember belly laughing while doing hill repeats. They encouraged us to not lose sight of the goal, while having fun.” This mentality made a big impression on Dauwalter and has become one of her core ethos. Even when deep into a 100-mile race, Dauwalter is known for her big smile and an infectious sense of joy. After graduating college, Dauwalter signed up for her first marathon, not expecting it to go well. “I thought 26 miles would kill me, but it didn’t, so I started to wonder how much longer I could go?” Curiosity led her to ultrarunning, but success didn’t come immediately. In 2012, Dauwalter dropped out of her first 100-mile race, which initially made her doubt herself. “I remember thinking I was a joke for trying it, but that moment was a key part of my path. It taught me about the mental side of ultrarunning and how important the things you tell yourself are, especially in the hardest moments.” Years later, Dauwalter’s mental fortitude is what truly sets her apart. She cherishes visits to what she calls “the pain cave”, the mental place she goes when she reaches her physical limit. She visualizes an actual cave, walks in, picks up a chisel, and starts chipping away. If needed, she’ll stay in the cave for hours. “Going into the cave is my whole purpose of signing up for a race. I don’t go there in training, so I feel lucky to visit in a race,” says Dauwalter. “On the start line, I want to get into that cave as quickly as I can and spend as much time as I can, making it bigger.” Dauwalter sees the same cave every time, returning to the exact spot she left off and keeps chipping away. Visiting the cave is a tool to keep moving forward and believing in herself, not a distraction. By focusing on swinging the chisel again and again, Dauwalter sends signals to her legs to keep going. Although unintentional, the pain cave is a near perfect allegory for the process of ultrarunning. It’s a craft that takes years of dedication and consistency to master, just like digging a huge cave. While the pain cave may sound dark and grueling, Dauwalter says it’s better framed as curiosity. “It’s impossible to do a 100-mile race perfectly, with so many variables and so much time at play. There is always something to learn, if I stay curious and keep moving the puzzle pieces around. I love that feeling. I love that I get to keep figuring it out.”"
"Aches, pains and new goals: what next for ‘hardest geezer’ Russ Cook after Africa run","Experts say best form of recovery will be to stay active, process traumas and set healthy targets Most people would consider running a marathon the pinnacle of fitness – but not Russ Cook. The endurance athlete hasjust completeda 9,940-mile (16,000km) run along the entire length of Africa. While Cook told reporters that he was a “little bit tired” and in need of a strawberry daiquiri after completing his odyssey, scientists who spoke to the Guardian suggested the road to recovery could be rockier than he anticipates. There will be some positive impacts on his health, such as increased cardiorespiratory fitness, more efficient delivery of oxygen to the muscles and better energy efficiency. But Dr Dan Gordon, an associate professor in cardiorespiratory exercise physiology at Anglia Ruskin University, warned that Cook could also expect an amplified version of what regular marathon runners experience up to 120 hours post-race: extreme tiredness, muscle soreness, joint aches and potential skin sores from sweating and clothes rubbing. He added that given the heat during Cook’s run, acute kidney issues were likely due to dehydration. Cook’s immune system will also be weakened as although some exercise gives it a boost, too much with insufficient recovery increases the risk of catching colds and flu. “As he recovers, this immune suppression will dissipate, but it is a relatively slow process,” Gordon said. The best form of recovery will be to stay active, with cycling and swimming, both good lower-impact forms of exercise, as well as stretching his muscles and sports therapy to recover the range of motion in areas not used in running that will have declined to compensate, Gordon said. Whether such ultra runs are a good idea was primarily a “philosophical question”, he said. “The human machine can do remarkable things and is also incredibly resilient. We know that as long as the pace per day is not excessive, this is achievable.” He suggested the psychological impact could be most severe, including the comedown from the exhilaration and adrenaline in the first 24-48 hours after finishing the race, and the psychological strain of a lonely experience. Martin Turner, a sports psychologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, said Cook would benefit from psychological support to help him process the traumatic aspects of the experience, such as being robbed at gunpoint, and to help him set healthy new goals, such as using his expertise to help others. “Humans have a tendency to hit highs and believe ‘OK, now I’m satisfied,’ but that’s not what humans are like, we’re always looking for the next thing,” he said. “We’re naturally predisposed to setting goals and pursuing them. My question would be: is he looking for something else? Potentially he’ll try to do more and bigger.” He said the key signs that fixating on exercise goals is becoming a problem were exercising through pain, injury and illness – as was the case for Cook. Indeed, many elite athletes struggle to set realistic exercise goals, he noted, and exhibit emotionally unhealthy behaviours, such as feeling frustrated when they can’t train “because you don’t want to do anything else”. Cook’s “hardest geezer” moniker could also suggest he may have wrapped his identity and sense of self up too closely with running, which Turner said could create a dependency on training. “It’s OK wanting to do things, ‘I want to push myself, meet these goals’, but when you spill over into ‘I have to do it, I have to succeed’, that’s quite unhealthy pressure. You suffer and sacrifice a lot.” Dan Lieberman, a Harvard professor and author of Exercised, said that although humans had evolved to run long distances, “we never evolved to run marathons, ultramarathons, or even insanely crazy distances like the length of Africa”. He said it “always raises concerns” when people pushed the human body way beyond what we evolved to do, though because there are so few examples of this, there is limited data around serious long-term consequences. Onerecent research paperlooked at the hearts of runners who ran a marathon a day across the UK and only found evidence of damage in two smokers. Most casual runners need not fear. Lieberman added: “We have a lot of data on how running is a phenomenal form of vigorous physical activity that has lifelong benefits. And the good news is you don’t have to run marathons to get the full benefits.”"
‘Hardest Geezer’ Russ Cook enjoys a day off running after epic Africa journey,"Endurance athlete from Worthing says he is ‘just trying to soak it all in’ after completing 352-day, 9,940-mile run After sinking a strawberry daiquiri and a few beers and enjoying a reunion with his girlfriend after more than a year apart, Russ Cook, AKA the “Hardest Geezer”, who completed his 9,940-mile (16,000km) run along theentire length of Africaon Sunday, woke up feeling “a little bit frosty, a little bit tired”. And for once, the 27-year-old endurance athlete from Worthing, West Sussex, who raised more than £700,000 for charity on his epic journey, was not pulling on his running shoes. It was all “quite, quite overwhelming”, he said. “Just trying to soak it all in really, trying to enjoy it, and the thought of not running today is a bit of a mad one. It is very, very strange,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain (GMB) live from Tunisia, where he crossed the finish line on Sunday afternoon after running for 352 days through 16 countries. “I think my body said ‘finally, nice one mate, chill out a minute’. Need to get some stretching done, maybe today, but yeah, no running. Unbelievable.” Cook’s challenge, to become the first to run the entire length ofAfrica, began on 22 April 2023 at South Africa’s most southerly tip, Cape Agulhas, and ended at Tunisia’s most northerly point, Ras Angela. It captured the imagination of the public, with his social media posts amassing millions of views. Some doubt has been cast on whether he is actually the first to run the length of continent, with the dispute appearing to centre on what technically constitutes the length of Africa. The World Runners Association, a group of nine athletes who have successfully circumnavigated the globe on foot, claimed one of its members, Jesper Kenn Olsen from Denmark, was the first person to run the length of Africa, during his “world run” challenge in which he ran across several continents. Olsen is said to have begun his challenge on 28 December 2008 in Taba, Egypt, and run 7,948 miles to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, completing his journey in 2010. “Mr Olsen ran through Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. He hereby fulfilled the criteria for a full-length run across Africa,” said Phil Essam, the president of the WRA. Cook’s significantly longer route was from south to north and along the west coast, and not as the crow flies. He seemed unfazed, telling GMB: “I haven’t heard anything about it, to be fair. But there’s plenty of people before me that have done lots of big runs and kudos to all of them because they are big challenges. So nothing but respect, really.” Cook faced several setbacks during his journey through rainforests, over mountain ranges and across the Sahara to raise money forthe Running Charity, which provides running and mental health programmes for young people experiencing homelessness and complex needs, andSandblast, which promotes awareness of the Saharawi people. He was robbed at gunpoint in Angola, held by men with machetes in the Republic of the Congo, and had health scares and visa complications. But there was never a moment he thought of giving up. “No, I always knew it was inevitable, just need to keep plugging away one step at a time and eventually it would get done,” he said. He now plans a haircut and beard trim – “we’re looking a bit wild these days” – and will enjoy some time with his girlfriend, Emily Bell, who told GMB: “It’s been scary, terrifying at times.” Cook said of seeing her: “It was crazy, the first time we have seen each other in 14 months. So I can’t really put into words how much that moment meant. But it’s beautiful to have a little bit of time with her.” Speaking of the time he was most frightened, Cook said it had been when he went missing and was separated from his supporters for days in the jungle, but was eventually freed after villagers armed with machetes were paid off. “The scariest moment was in the Congo, when I was on the back of a motorbike, thinking I was about to die, getting driven into the jungle. That was pretty nuts,” he told reporters in Tunisia. “Probably for about one minute I thought about quitting, and then I realised I couldn’t, so that was about as close as it got.” Of his challenge overall he said: “I knew it was going to be hard but I knew I was also going into the unknown, so I had no idea really of how hard it was going to be.”"
British ultrarunner Jasmin Paris is first woman to finish Barkley Marathons,"The British ultrarunner Jasmin Paris has become the first woman ever to finish the notorious Barkley Marathons race in Tennessee. The 40-year-old was one of five runners to complete this year’s event, which is made up of five punishing 20-mile loops around Frozen Head State Park in the east of the US state. Paris’s finishing time was 59 hours, 58 minutes and 21 seconds – 99 seconds inside the 60-hour cut-off. Paris made headlines in the UK in 2019 by winningthe Montane Spine Racealong the Pennine Way, breaking the course record for the mixed-sex event by 12 hours. She made more history in the US on Friday, adding her name to a list of 20 competitors to have completed the event since it was extended to 100 miles in 1989. Ihor Verys recorded the fastest time at this year’s event, with the Canada-based Ukrainian runner finishing in 58hrs 44min 59sec. Americans John Kelly and Jared Campbell also completed the race for the third and fourth time respectively, with New Zealand’s Greig Hamilton also beating the cut-off time. In a sporting gesture, Campbell alsoappeared to offer Paris the choiceto take on the final loop in the clockwise direction – which is considered slightly less difficult – as the remaining competitors camped out before the closing stage. The runners on the final loop must alternate between clockwise and anticlockwise, so that they are not running together.

"Naps, tacos and 11 world records: how Camille Herron ran 560 miles in six days","The ultrarunner is famed for her achievements in long-distance events. Breaking 11 world records in a single competition may be her finest feat to date It’s a hot winter noon on a Monday and Camille Herron is asleep. She lies on a cot in a tent next to a flat dirt track. Lined with palm trees and white stone and desert grass, it loops two and a half miles along the lip of a large olive-green lake. Over the lake, towers a screen of steep mountains covered in bush scrub. It’s one resort among many in California’s Coachella Valley and the setting for Lululemon’s FURTHER event, a chance for 10 select women to run as far as they can in six days. It’s the penultimate day, and her nap is stretching long – five hours – and the timer by the line is ticking – and Herron has less than 24 hours to run 48 miles. If she can will herself on, she’ll break a record that has stood for more than three decades. Once the gold standard of what human beings could endure on foot, the six-day race predates both trail races and the modern marathon. In the 19th century, thousands of spectators lined up to watch these “pedestrians” walk six days – in the Empire Skating Rink at PT Barnum’s Hippodrome, where the Met Life Building now stands in lower Manhattan, and in fairs across the United States. Popular in Europe and America, they brought bettors and challengers and diversity. The first women’s six-day race took place in Chicago in 1876. According to Davy Crockett of theUltrarunningHistory website, “more than 300 women” competed in these near week-long events in the 19th century. In 1880 a Haitian immigrant, Frank Hart, “wowed audiences at New York’s Madison Square Garden” by completing 565 miles in six days. He came away with $21,567, about $679,000 in today’s money. Then came accusations ofcheating, poisonings, the rise of the bicycle, and the final death blow, baseball. The 1980s saw a resurgence of the timed-format ultramarathons and the men’s six-day record was broken for the first time in a century. But it seemed a high-water mark had been reached. No one had come close to Yiannis Kouros’s 645 miles in 1988 and Sandy Barwick’s 549 in 1990, the men’s and women’s records respectively. “Their records have proven utterly resistant to successors,” says former Trans-America race director Jesse Riley. Then in 2015, a lanky 5ft 9in runner from Norman, Oklahoma appeared on the ultramarathon scene. With an awkward gait, a wide smile, and an eccentric personality, Herron, a 2:37 marathoner, started an unprecedented streak. In 2017, she became the third American to win the Comrades Marathon, a storied 55-mile race in South Africa, and in 2023 won the Spartathalon, a 153-mile ultramarathon in Greece. She is the first athlete, male or female, to win both. That same year, she logged 270 miles around a 400m track in Bruce, Australia. She did so in 48 hours not only improving her own mark but becoming the first woman to hold an outright American record – for men and women – in distance running. When the FURTHER event started last Wednesday, Herron was already the holder of multiple world records from 50 to 250 miles. A small crowd gathered under four towers of stage lights and rows of orange and white tents. The 42-year-old was in shades, a water bottle stuffed in the crotch of her shorts. On day one, she chugged a Coke float and ran 133 miles. Day two, she downed tacos and added another 113 miles. On 8 March International Women’s Day, she broke the American 48-hour road record for women. More would follow. Each time Herron broke a record, she held her arms out wide, her hands pointing to the sky as if to say, “isn’t this incredible?” The fact that she is openly awed by what she does has at times made her a target in the ultrarunning community. Her whimsical pre-race mantra of “letting the magic come out” only adds to that. But it’s hard to argue with the numbers. And the numbers and records were piling up: a new 300km mark, the American 48-hour road record, a new 300-mile road record, the women’s 500km world record, the women’s 500 mile. When she completed the latter, she danced around the start line in pink compression socks, celebrating with high fives and hugs. But the six-day mark was still out there – Barwick, 1990, 549 miles. As Herron slept during the day on Monday, questions started popping up on running forums and Facebook groups. “Bell lap!” wrote ultrarunning veteran and stats master Mike Dobies. “Did she save enough for a final push?” Run, eat, hydrate, sleep, and repeat. Over and over and over again for 5+ days.Loving all of the official photos coming in too - they’ve captured some amazing moments for all of the athletes.Sinead (crew)#further#lululemonfurtherpic.twitter.com/IBUyi1U6Iu The push comes at 2.30 in the afternoon. Herron is up and moving and soon the night will welcome cooler air and more miles. But after a few loops, she’s off course again. Resting again. “Run the routine,” she tells herself:Run, eat, hydrate, sleep, and repeat. But it’s getting harder to do any of those now. As Christian Griffith once saidabout his run across America, the goal is “way too close for way too long.” Sign up toSoccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion Close is now 40 miles in 18 hours, and Herron is up and moving, recording 15-minute miles; for her, a walking pace, a death slog. Then another stop. She’s now in the realm of uncertainty the late ultrarunner Al Howie called the Ultra Daily News: “She’s dying … she’s back from the dead … she won’t make it.” All through the night she keeps up the fight and at 3.30am Herron crosses the invisible threshold: 550 miles, a new world record, the Biggy, the six-day. However, the International Association of Ultrarunners, which ratifies the six-day race, doesn’t call any marks past a 48-hour run a world record. In the IAU’s phraseology, her performance is simply a ‘best’. Herron promptly takes a nap, while praise flies in fast and furious. “It was just a matter of time,” says Trishul Cherns, head of the Global Organization of Multi-Day Ultramarathoners, an organization that tracks ultrarunning statistics. “Camille’s performance has proved that women who enter the game can compete on an equal footing with men.” Crockett says she “is the greatest woman ultrarunner ever, on tracks and roads.” And Barwick, the New Zealander whose record or “best” or accomplishment Herron broke, says she’s “in awe of her speed. A truly amazing performance, so courageous and inspiring to all athletes.” But Herron isn’t done. As the sun rises over the Santa Rosa Mountains, she lifts herself to her feet once more. One more push. One more loop, then two, three. She reaches 900km, another record, then it’s over. In her wake are 11 world records recognized by GOMU and a world best performance by the IAU. Either way, the numbers on the LED screen read a clear 560.3 miles. Above is one word in all caps: FURTHER."
‘Ten-minute miles are the new eight’: the senior ultrarunners pushing the envelope,"Not only are more runners doing ultramarathons in their seventies and eighties, they’re also going faster On a bone-cold morning in November, Wally Hesseltine, far from his cozy California home, was lying prone in southern Illinois – beside a trail of crushed gravel – his right knee bruised and bloodied. The initial 95 miles of the Tunnel Hill 100 footrace had unfolded with the swiftness of a fleeting breeze. Brisk, beautiful miles under a collage of crisp autumn foliage. The 80-year-old hadn’t fallen once. But the last five miles presented a particular problem. They were all downhill. He couldn’t feel it, but he could see it – his upper body drooping like a glove without a hand – his hunched shadow sinking into itself until he finally dove into the soft grass. Little is known about “the leans”, a temporary but debilitating condition that can crop up in older ultrarunners. The phenomenon is oft observed but poorly understood. The same is true of Hesseltine. Buoyed by the clamber of voices in the distance, the octogenarian picked himself up – dashed toward the finish line – tripped on the timing mat and went airborne. For a moment it was over, the love-hate battle with time. He was now the fastest 80-year-old to ever run 100 miles. Columbian novelist, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, once wrote: “It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.” Not only are more runners doing ultramarathons in their seventies and eighties, they’re also going faster. In May, Jeff Hagen, 75, knocked an hour off the 50-mile record for his age group. But it wasn’t enough. Gene ‘the Ultra-Geezer’ Dykes, also 75, bested that by an hour – in the same race – smashing seven master’s records from 25 to 100 kilometers in a 12-hour period. And the record Hesseltine eclipsed in November? It was so new it had yet to be ratified. Four years ago, ‘Fast Eddy’ Rousseau set it at 32 hours. This spring David Blaylock brought it down to 29. Hesseltine got it to 26 and along the way beat 51 of the 179 finishers, most decades younger than him. Leaning back in his chair at his California law office, he jokes, “Ten-minute miles are the new eight.” A myriad of suggestions exists to explain the growing presence of older athletes. A predominant theory over the last decade has been that we are merely unlocking abilities carried over from our ancestors. That as Homo sapiens evolved as a nomadic species, we hunted game over long distances, our advantage being our ability to sweat. The energy and speed of the young were beneficial in the last sprints for the kill, while the elders’ tracking knowledge proved essential in pacing the animal over longer periods and bringing up the rear with supplies. Exeter professor and ultrarunner Dr Julian Jamison doesn’t see a correlation. “The hunter-gatherers weren’t living till 80,” he says and suggests a mix of patience, pacing, training and hereditary elements. However, he admits “the number of datapoints is still so small in ultrarunning. We simply don’t know.” Many ultrarunners have long subscribed to the idea of putting “miles in the legs” while avoiding injury, and science tends to agree. Three papers in the last decade have shown the benefits of cumulative distance in older ultrarunners. They pace better, take better care of their bodies, and have less injuries than their younger counterparts at both marathon and ultra distances. By racking up more miles, our endurance base strengthens and makes us capable of much more than previously imagined. Seven hundred ninety-six: that’s how many ultramarathons Rob Apple has run. But you’ll usually find him at the back, an example of the law of diminishing returns. “I remember when he was fast,” says Lazarus Lake, the mastermind of The Barkley Marathons, his voice warm like gravy. “I tell people, if you want to run well at 70, start late.” Dr Hirofumi Tanaka agrees. Director of exercise physiology at the University of Texas, he was at the World Master Athletics Championships in March, in part to see Japanese sprinter Hiroo Tanaka. The retired teacher burst out of the gate in the 60-meter dash as if his lane was on a conveyor belt. Head down, arms and legs churning like pistons, he ran out of the camera frame of the other runners. His time? 10.95 seconds. The 92-year-old has held world records at 100 and 200 meters and didn’t start running until he was 60. Sister Madonna ‘the Iron Nun’ Buder, completed her first Ironman at 55, her last at 82. Hiromu Inada finished an Ironman at 87. He started at 70. Gene Dykes was 56 when he ran his first marathon. At 70, he logged a 2:54. Jennifer Russo started ultras at 50. This spring, at 57, the mother of three ran 300 miles in three days, a mark no American woman has reached at any age. None of this surprises Tanaka. “Older people are getting closer to younger performances,” he says. “They are closing the gap.” He’s seen a dramatic shift in Spontaneous Walking Speed – professorspeak for the pace at which we do everyday tasks. Not long ago, 70 was the magic age when times would begin to decrease. Now, it’s over 75. His research has also shown the older the age, the greater the improvement we can expect to see with training. And that, he says, applies to and should encourage all of us. He attributes much of the phenomenon of elite masters to what he calls “a Formula 1 approach” – a pit crew of coaches, trainers, and various equipment for recovery. But none of these theories explain Wally Hesseltine. He’s run 180 ultramarathons, broken his pelvis in a skiing accident, his nose in a fall, and tore a rotator cuff on the way to the bathroom. He also didn’t start late. When he began running on 8 June 1981, IBM was launching the first personal computer. Now, he runs with an iPhone so his wife can track him and pick him up. Sign up toSoccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion What he does have is what he calls “compulsive obsessiveness”. Five days a week, he’s at his law office, handling manslaughter cases and white-collar drug crime. After work, he runs three to 10 miles, showers in the office, and goes home for dinner. No TV. No social media. Instead, he reads. In 1990 he assigned himself a list of great books. “I was going to attack reading,” he says and devoted himself to at least 25 pages a day. Now, he’s read over 6,000 books. He did the same with music, memorizing CDs of the 1,000 greatest hits of classical, blues and country. Dr Tanaka has observed similar personalities in other elite aging athletes: an optimistic, goal-oriented outlook on life, good relationships, positive attitude. They are often talkative, funny and, while serious about their running, they don’t take themselves seriously. And few are more quick-witted and humorous than Fast Eddy Rousseau. At some point in last year’s GOMU 48-hour race, he quipped, “I feel like I’m dying, but I’m afraid I won’t.” He finished 100 miles, stumbled back, nearly fell, grinned, and began making jokes. This June he lost his wife, had a stroke, underwent surgery to clear out a carotid artery, and was diagnosed with AFib. “All the things that happen to old runners happen to all old people in life,” says Lazarus Lake. “The ones that keep going just get more out of it.” Despite setbacks that could have a normal 84-year-old in a nursing home, Rousseau plans to be at the USA Track and Field 100-mile road championship in February. Hesseltine hopes to be there as well. But each time, there’s a nervous feeling, a worry. Maybe this is the race when I show up and I’m the only one left in my age group. One runner who won’t be there is master athletics champion David Carr. The Australian died in June at the age of 91. Just three months before, he was in Poland, in lane five, for a 400-meter race. CanadianRunningcalled it “the comeback of the year (maybe century)”. In lane six was his biggest rival, Hiroo Tanaka. After the first loop of the 200-meter track, the Japanese runner was more than 30 meters ahead. No one, certainly not Carr, could’ve predicted Tanaka would reach a lactic wall. But when he did, Carr reacted as he had as a boy, instinctively. A runner in front of him had slowed. There was an opening. So, he called on whatever he had left and in the final stretch closed more than 20 meters of ground on Tanaka for the win. He then did what he was always taught in sports; he approached his competitors and shook their hands. There’s something about seeing it, runners at ages we equate with our grandparents, that has us grasping for life hacks. And maybe, that’s where we miss the point. Maybe what they are showing us is how to be moreinthe moment. For Wally Hesseltine the moment is another chance to go long – deep - into the extreme where legs burn and lungs pray for air – into parts of himself that beg him to stop. And maybe that’s what we’re all so scared to death of. Stopping."
Ultrarunner Harvey Lewis reaches the end of Lazarus Lake’s endless backyard,"Harvey Lewis, a 47-year-old Ohio ultramarathoner, won the last-man-standing Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra race after running the approximate distance between San Francisco and LA The pleasures of winning a world championship can sometimes be small, but immediate. The evidence is plain in the smile of ultrarunner Harvey Lewis at 6.59pm on Wednesday 25 October. Lewis has just won the2023 Backyard Ultra World Championship, but what appears to be of greater immediate relief is that after 450 miles, and for the first time in 108 hours (four and a half days), Lewis will not have to run four and one sixth miles (6.7km) at the start of the next hour. Ultrarunners like Lewis compete in ultramarathons, or ultras. Any footrace longer than a traditional marathon (26.2 miles, or 42.2 km) is considered an ultra, although within that designation there exist multitudes – in New York City alone, ultras can range frompop culture-themed 28-mile eventstoepic journeys thousands of miles in length. Many ultras use a straightforward racing format: the race starts and the first person across the finish line wins. Othersapply a multi-day, multi-stage structuresimilar to cycling’s Tour de France.Backyardultras, however, employ a unique format designed to test runners’ wills as much as their bodies. In a backyard ultra, racers must complete a four-and-one-sixth-mile trail loop every hour, starting on the hour–they must do thiseveryhour, no exceptions. Matters of strategy and speed are left to the participants’ discretion. Runners may take the entire hour to complete a lap, perhaps opting for slow pace to conserve energy. Alternatively, if runners finish a lap in less than an hour, they can use any remaining time to eat, hydrate, sit, stretch, talk strategy with their support crew, or, crucially, to sleep. Indeed, because backyard ultras run throughout the night, these minutes of sleep between laps are runners’ only chance to rest throughout the entirety of the race. By completing the four-and-one-sixth-mile loop 24 times over 24 hours, participants run exactly 100 miles per day. Run, rest (if you have the time), repeat until you can’t. That’s it. It’s simple enough, yet a paradox emerges when describing backyard ultras. On one hand, they are teeming with statistics, data points and records, as if tailor-made for detailed description. Conversely, such analyses do little to express the reality underlying ultraathletes’ achievements. The numbers are just too large to understand intuitively. “It doesn’t matter if it’s 37 miles or 307 miles,” says race designer Lazarus Lake, “People have no concept of [distance] at all.” To communicate some sense of the distances being covered, Lake (familiarly known as Laz, although his real name is Gary Cantrell) recommends describing ultrarunning accomplishments by identifying an equivalent city-to-city journey. Using this method, during his championship-winning run, Lewis ran the equivalent of the distance from Washington DC to Boston. Or from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Or London to Edinburgh. Use whichever comparison seems the most incredible to you; all three actually fall short of the 450 miles Lewis ran. Just as statistics alone fail to accurately convey the magnitude of Lewis’s accomplishment, so too does referring to Lake as a ‘race designer’ neglect to describe his standing within the world of ultrarunning. Among hismany other contributions to the sport, Lake invented the backyard ultra itself in the early 2010s. To this day, he hosts the format’s individual world championships every other year on his 150-acre property in central Tennessee. To ultrarunners, Lake is something of an inscrutable, prickly-tempered guru, or even folk hero. Lake prefers to describe himself more modestly as a “hillbilly from the Tennessee mountains”. He also appears to enjoy alternatively satisfying and subverting the expectations that accompany his public persona. During the race, he often snaps with sincere-sounding anger at individuals for transgressions as minor as, say, standing in the wrong place. Before the moment gets too uncomfortable, however, a glance toward Lake’s face reveals a twinkly-eyed smile. His grumpiness is performative and productive, a technique he presumably perfected during his 35 years as a high school baseball and basketball coach. Thesubject of multiple profilesover the last decade, Lake isoccasionally presented as a sadistwho uses his famously difficult races to inflict as much pain as possible on runners. In conversation, this doesn’t appear to be the case. Although he projects the flannel-wearing, cigarette-smoking, big-bearded image of a ‘man of the woods’, Lake is a nature-loving intellectual who can chat at length about everything from college football to the effects of new technologies on labour markets. Change his accent and passport, and Lake would fit easily intothe much-loved tradition of British eccentrics. Whatever the underlying inspiration, Lake’s backyard ultras have introduced a new dynamic to the millennia-old history of competitive running and the world’s ultrarunners have noticed. Just a decade into their existence, backyard ultras are now regularly held in more than 70 countries and exist within an international framework that allows for robust world championships featuring elite athletes. Four and half days before Lewis was able to enjoy his world-beating, record-breaking 108-hour run, he was just one of 75 world-class runners standing on a gravel driveway on a cold Saturday morning in rural Tennessee. Venus is visible and the surrounding walnut trees are still mostly silhouettes in the dawn sky. At precisely 7.00am, Lake rings a cowbell and the runners start their first lap. Nearlyall of the world’s greatest backyard ultrarunners are present; Jamal Said, Nazarri Hnat, and Moises Lopez (the Pakistani, Ukrainian and Venezuelan national champions, respectively) are unable to travel to the US for the competition. Their countries’ flags hang prominently from the timekeeper’s table at the starting line. Roughly half of the remaining runners are their home countries’ national champions, while the other half qualified by running especially impressive times at high-profile backyard ultras around the world. Although all 75 have a chance at the tile, there do exist a handful of favorites. As the course recordholder (85 laps), Lewis is among them. So is Phil Gore, a 37-year-old firefighter from Western Australia who entered the championship as the world backyard ultra recordholder –he completed 102 loopsearlier this year. The previous record of 101 loops washeld jointly by Merijn Geerts and Ivo Steyaert, both of whom were among the six Belgian runners also present to the world championships (all six ranat least200 miles in the race). When asked why Belgian runners seem to excel in the backyard format, Steyaert replied, “Because we’re stubborn.” Gore mentions both Geerts and Steyaert when discussing the competition ahead of the event. “I saw their [record-setting] race, and it looked like they had a lot more left,” he says. Gore makes the same observation about his own record-setting performance. All were prevented from pushing themselves further by a quirk of the rules governing backyard ultras – the winner can only run as far as the next best runner, plus one additional lap (eg if the second-to-last runner completes 50 laps, the remaining athlete must complete 51 laps to win, but cannot run any farther). The first two days proceed relatively uneventfully and, in retrospect, are a bit of blur. After 48 hours (and 200 miles/320 km) of racing, more than half of the starting field (and all four of the female runners) are still in the race. Days three and four, however, see multiple prominent runners drop out of the race. American Jennifer Russo, current holder of thewomen’s backyard ultra record for most laps, takes too long to finish her 54th lap. After exceeding the one-hour time limit on his 54th lap, Japan’s Tokimasa Hiratu tearfully apologizes for what he believes to be his poor performance (he’d run over 220 miles). Canadian Amanda Nelson collapses at the finish line after 57 hours (she was fully recovered by the following day, even going on a 10k walk to “get the blood flowing”). Irishman Keith Russell, who’d beenaveraging a blistering 44 minutes per lapfor more than three days, suffered a fall that prevented him from completing his 75th lap in time. “As Laz would say, ‘You can’t have a bad hour,’” Russell notes. After surpassing his previous personal best by 15 laps, Mexican runner Rodolfo Ramírez earns a round of applause from the small on-site crowd after failing to complete his 76th loop. Ramírez had become a fan favorite through a combination of his strong running,Mexico’s historical ties to ultrarunning, and the enthusiastic on-site support of his mother (and support crew), Magdalena Leonides, whose patriotic flag-waving, improvised lyrics toCielito Lindo, and vocal cheering for every runner made her one of the event’s most recognizable faces. The sight of the Philippines’ dehydrated Jivee Tolentino walking to the finish of his (timed-out) 82nd lap, severely dehydrated and supported on the shoulders of his support crew, prompted murmurs about the race’s lack of an on-site ambulance. The absence of on-duty medical personnel is likely the consequence of backyard ultrarunning’s temporary presence at a crossroads somewhere between its DIY, run-with-your-friends roots and its (likely) formally organized future. Fortunately for Tolentino, his support crew includes registered nurse Donald Sombilla. The race has more personal stories worth telling than there is space to print them here. Ultimately, however, after 103 laps (and, thus, already in ‘new world record’ territory), the championship came down to a one-on-one duel of wills between Lewis and Ukrainian-Canadian runner Ihor Verys. At 47 and 29 years of age, respectively, Lewis and Verys are a clash of contrasting styles. “It’s a quandary,” Lake observes before the race is over, “Because Ihor is clearly the stronger runner, but Harvey won’t give up. And, [in backyards], you don’t have to be the strongest runner. You just have to be strongenough.” In his 107th loop, Lewis sprinted through the portion of the trail visible from the starting line, a move he later admitted was an attempt to get into Verys’s head. It worked. Verys failed to finish his next lap, giving an eloquent and gracious concession speech at the finish line before the Cincinnati schoolteacher completes his record-setting 108th lap. Owing to the previously mentioned restrictions, Lewis couldn’t run farther even if he wanted to. So, he sits, smiles, and fields questions. He is at the frontier of lucidity and sleep-deprived incoherence. He mentions being “plant-powered” (Lewis is vegan) and theBrighton Center, the charity for which his championship-winning performance raised money. Mostly, however, he smiles. He, alone among the 75 runners who competed at this year’s world championship, knows what it’s like to reach the end of Lazarus Lake’s endless backyard."
Dauwalter smashes Western States ultramarathon record by 78 minutes,"Courtney Dauwalter smashed the course record in the women’s Western States – the worlds’ oldest 100-mile race – taking almost 80 minutes off the previous leading time. Meanwhile, Tom Evans, a former soldier, became the first Briton to win the men’s event. Arriving at a remote part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 379 runners – who gained a place in the race by winning a lottery – set off from Olympic Valley, California, before finishing in Auburn, a city in Placer County that is part of the Sacramento metropolitan area. The first 15 miles of the 100.2-mile course were affected by snowfall, after which runners were confronted by a 16-mile section no longer protected by shade as a result of the devastation of last year’s Mosquito fire. Otherwise, though, conditions were relatively helpful – temperatures were the fifth-lowest in race history and well shy of the 100-degree Farenheit mark (37.7°C) that has become usual. The clement weather helped the 38-year-old Dauwalter record a mark of 15hr 29min 33sec – a time that beat Ellie Greenwood’s 2012 record by a 78 minutes – one of nine sub-18-hour finishes, a record in the women’s race. Running without a pacemaker, Dauwalter led from start to finish, destroying the field after the halfway point to cross the line almost an hour and 14 minutes clear of Katie Schide, who came second. Evans, 31, had finished third in 2019, his time of 14:59:44 the fastest recorded by a non-American. For much of this year’s contest, he was accompanied by Dakota Jones, who had cycled the 680 miles from his home in Utah to the race’s start, but dropped his adversary after mile 71. Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Jones ended up 17th with Evans crossing the line alone in 14:40:22, the fourth-best time in the race’s history."
"If you can walk on it, you can run on it: a beginner’s guide to trail running","More meditative and less repetitive than road running, trail running offers fitness with a view. And the chances of injury are lower than you might expect Jumping over tree roots and slogging up steep slopes may not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but a growing number of Australians are pounding dirt instead of pavement, taking their exercise (and social lives) to the trails. You may have stood to the side for them while bushwalking, pausing patiently as cheery folk with strange little backpacks trot past. Or perhaps an algorithm has fed you some idyllic shots of sweaty people on mountaintops or winding their way through a forest. Australia’s trail running events calendar is increasingly packed, with more than 200 runs around the countryfrom now until the end of winter alone. There are more clubs and social groups than you could poke a hiking pole at and, of course, the scenery is beautiful. Most assuringly for beginners, you’re allowed to walk before you run. “People don’t realise that it’s OK to walk and it’s encouraged,” says Megan Brown, a trail and ultra runner and coach based in Brisbane. “And sometimes it’s actually more efficient to hike a hill [instead of] running it.” Any unpaved natural surface can be a trail run, but often there are a good dose of hills. Those are the two main environmental differences from road running. Trails can range from gentle, meandering walking paths to narrow rocky traverses, from sandy beaches to snowy summits. Brown says a trail run is more about going for an adventure than a typical road run: you have to watch your footing. “You do need to be much more alert with the rocks and roots, the ups and the downs, and picking your feet up,” she says. Initially it can be mentally draining “because you have to stay so focused”. “But then once you get into a rhythm and get your confidence levels up, it’s probably more meditative … you’re out in nature, you’ve got the birds, it’s quite peaceful.” Brown says the best way to build your confidence is to explore a short, local trail that you can run out and back on. If you can walk on it, you can run on it. National and state parks are good places to find trails, but large urban parks often have networks of dirt trails running through them too. Brendan Davies, an Athletics Australia running coach based in the Blue Mountains, says even if you’re already a runner, the varied and sometimes unpredictable terrain will affect your body differently. On a trail the impact is shared across more muscles and ligaments, which can actually reduce injury risk. “You move sideways a lot in trail running, to stabilise yourself,” Davies says. “Because you’re going up and down, you’re switching muscle groups continually.” This means the repetitive strain injuries many road runners develop are less likely. “Sure you can get injuries like twists, ankles rolling and things like that. But even that decreases the longer you train on trails as well, because all the ligaments and tendons get stronger. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But he says it is important beginner trail runners don’t try to “bite off too much too soon”. “It’s just about starting small – small distances and on easy, familiar terrain. So your body can get used to it before you try to step it up to the next level.” You won’t need new shoes either, says Laura Coles, owner of specialist trail running store the Trail Co. If you already own regular road running shoes, it is fine to start with those, then upgrade to specialised gear later on. While the cost of entry to trail running is low, it can quickly increase if you get more adventurous – or develop a taste for the latest tech. “Once you’ve decided you want to stick with it, it is good to get some trail runners,” says Coles. “They will make you more comfortable and your road shoes won’t get worn down.” Davies suggests starting with a pair of all-round trail shoes “well fitted for your foot and your gait” with “reasonable grip”. “[Trail shoes] are usually developed to drain water a bit better and have a more robust outer, so they can handle being knocked around a bit more.” Davies suggests bringing your phone and a small first aid kit whenever you’re running away from residential areas. “I rarely would go out for a run in the bush without a snake bandage,” he says. “Even if it is just half an hour, you never know. You just have to cover worst-case scenarios.” You can get snake bandages starting from around $10 from pharmacies – but make sure youknow how to use themfirst. Sign up toSaved for Later Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips after newsletter promotion Once you start running for longer, or in more remote areas, you’ll need somewhere to put your first aid, water, food and clothes. That’s where vests and belts come in. A running vest is a small fitted backpack that won’t bounce around too much when you run where you can stash trail snacks. Prices start from around $100. Coles says there are loads of choices for food on the move, including gels and “powdered nutrition in your water to give you energy while you drink”. “But other people can’t stand that,” she says. “If you don’t want to get into all the technical stuff, you could just take a Vegemite sandwich.” You may not need to do trail-specific training at first, but as soon as you start pushing the distances and getting more technical and steep, you will need to prepare your body more, says Davies – especially if you don’t live in the mountains. “If you’re living in the city, and you want to come up to the mountains and run trail running races, you have to supplement your road running with some extra gym work,” he says. “Maybe a couple of sessions a week, focusing on your lower body and core. “Find places where you can train that will simulate running up a hill: so, stairs [and] doing hill rep sessions. It’s all about getting comfortable hiking up a hill first.” And don’t forget to hone your downhill running technique too. One of the best ways to get started trail running is to find a group to go with, because, as Coles says, trail running has “a big community”. “I think because you do have to go a bit slower … you end up chatting,” she says. Coles is a race director and says she sees teenagers right through to runners in their 70s. “It’s a very welcoming sport.” If you don’t have access to transport, joining a tour can take the logistics out of your hands, and they usually offer vests and hiking poles for hire. Like tours, races can keep you on the right path, provide a supportive environment to run in, and sometimes open up areas that aren’t normally accessible. Brown says signing up for a race can “give you something to aim for that keeps you going out on the rainy days, or the days when you’re feeling a bit flat”. Added bonuses are the party at the finish line, a medal, and maybe even lifelong connections. Brown even met her husband at a trail event. “We were on the run and I asked him if he had anything for chafing,” she says. “He handed me his body glide, then I proceeded to rub it all over my inner thighs. You could say it was love at first sight.” Ultra-Trail Australia, May, New South WalesThe southern hemisphere’s biggest trail running event has a 11km option if you want to get in on the action.

‘I don’t want this to end’: runner hits Melbourne after covering length of Australia in 150 consecutive marathons,"Erchana Murray-Bartlett reaches end of epic journey from ‘tip to toe’ of Australia – smashing women’s record for consecutive daily marathons Months after starting out from the tip of Cape York, Erchana Murray-Bartlett is set to complete her 150th consecutive daily marathon inMelbourneon Monday, finishing a record-breaking journey through Australia’s eastern states. Murray-Bartlett set out in August to run more than 6,200km, raising money for theWilderness Societyand awareness of Australia’sextinction crisis– just days beforeNed Brockmannbegan his 4,000km run from the west to east coast. Her journey has taken her along beaches, dirt roads and through Victoria’s high country, interspersed with visits to schools and conservation groups. To date, the runner has raised more than $98,000. Murray-Bartlett’s final marathon is due to start at 1.30pm on Monday at the Pillars of Wisdom in Melbourne, and should end about 6pm with four loops of the Tan track. The current Guinness world record for most consecutive daily marathons (female) was set last August by EnglishwomanKate Jayden, who completed 106 in as many days. Murray-Bartlett has been keeping a detailed record of her daily runs, which the Guinness world records will consider for certification after her journey is complete. The 32-year-old, who spoke breezily on the phone while finishing one of her daily marathons, said: “I’m so proud of what my body has been able to achieve. I’m so proud of the money we’ve raised.” Murray-Bartlett has been joined by other runners in recent weeks. “[They’re] keeping me going,” she said. “It’s distracting me from the pain in my hips and my knees and my feet.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup Nearly five months of daily running has taken its toll. Murray-Bartlett said her feet had increased half a shoe size and were covered in calluses. “They’re not that sightly at the moment, to be honest,” she said. “I don’t have any tendinopathies or broken bones … just overuse and soreness in my knees, lower legs and in my back. Also I have this constant brain fog that is making everything really difficult. “You almost feel like you’ve aged 50 years.” The past several months have seen her run along the New South Wales coastline and around the Victorian peaks of Mount Hotham and Mount Feathertop. Sign up toAfternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “I did more hills in December than the rest of the trip combined – I think it was 14 or 15km of elevation,” she said. To allow her body to cope with limited recovery time each day, Murray-Bartlett ran slower than she would have if competing in a race; she completed her marathons in about four hours, at a pace between 5min50s and 6min a kilometre. Throughout her journey, she aimed to eat between 5,000 and 6,000 calories a day. “I’ve lost more weight than I anticipated, and as a nutritionist, I was very careful of that,” she said. “So what I even thought was a ludicrous amount of food wasn’t enough. “My intake is now four or five big meals a day and just constant snacking. I’m at the point now where I’m almost too tired to eat.” Murray-Bartlett’s final weekend of marathons involved a public group run along the Warburton trail in the Yarra Ranges, as well as a run with family members, including relatives who have flown in from overseas to see her cross the finish line. “I don’t want this to ever end because I’m having a lot of fun,” she said. “But I also really do need to stop because my body is at its limit.”"
"Running the Mont Blanc ultra, the world’s most famous trail race","I’ve been running uphill for over an hour, scaling this narrow mountain trail, when we pass through some trees. This must be the top, I’m thinking, hopefully, as we crest the pass. But alas, rising up on the other side are more hulking mountains and snaking up through the middle of them, like a line of ants, are the tiny dots of the runners ahead of us. “Putain,” swears the French runner behind me. I know exactly how he feels. The 170kmUltra Trail du Mont Blancis the most famous trail race in the world. In the fast-growing sport of Mountain Ultra Trail (MUT) running, it’s the big one, the sport’s Super Bowl. For a week at the end of August each year, the town of Chamonix in the French Alps is completely taken over by ultra runners and their supporters. Any unsuspecting visitors arriving in the area would be left baffled by this strange world of short shorts and little backpacks and super-fit people that they’d wandered into. During UTMB week – which acts as the climax of the brand new UTMB World Series – about 10,000 runners compete across seven different races of varying lengths. I’m here to run the 100km CCC race, which starts in Courmayeur in Italy and follows a route around Mont Blanc, scaling more than 6,000m of ascent along the way, passing through Switzerland, before finishing in Chamonix. Why would anyone want to run so far? It’s a good question. On one level, taking part in these races is an adventure into the wild. By traversing such great distances on foot, you get to explore some of the most remote corners of these incredible mountains. Sure, you spend a lot of time looking down at your feet, but every time you look up, the landscape takes your breath away. But it is also a race. Despite my intention to primarily run to enjoy the experience, once we get going I find myself pushing hard and I finish in under 20 hours, an arbitrary goal I set myself before the start. You can choose to go slower, of course, but it doesn’t really make things any easier, since it just means you’re out there running for longer. So I decide to embrace the inherent competitiveness of the event and get my skates on. I can then spend the rest of the weekend relaxing and soaking up the unique atmosphere of Chamonix during UTMB week. It’s handy that my hotel, La Folie Douce, is so close to the finish, so that after finally making it to Chamonix in the middle of the night, I can hobble back to a hot shower and a blissfully comfy bed. The next morning I spend a heavenly few hours stretched out by the hotel’s outdoor pool with stunning views across the mountains that look a little unreal in the morning sunlight, like a huge Athena poster backdrop. Chamonix also has an abundance of great places to eat – an essential part of the post-race recovery process – from the fine seasonal French cuisine at the Mont Blanc Hotel, the oldest, most elegant hotel in town, to the hearty Soul Bowls and vegan burgers at the Bighorn Bistro (a favourite haunt of the big-eating elite ultra runners). Once I feel recovered, I head back into town to sit outside a café and cheer the last UTMB runners home, each one creating a wave of noise from the crowds as they pass. For more than 100 miles and for up to 48 hours, they’ve been running up and down mountains, without sleep, and the effort is etched on their faces. Having done a race myself, I feel a connection to each runner that passes, and each time it brings a tear to my eye to see them so close to finishing their epic journey. For more details on UTMB Mont Blanc, go toutmbmontblanc.com. La Folie Douce has rooms from £90 per night (lafoliedoucehotels.com) To qualify for the UTMB races in Chamonix, you must compete in at least one of the 25 UTMB World Series events, where you can collect ‘running stones’ for the UTMB race lottery. Entries for the lottery open in December. Here are five of the best UTMB World Series events to consider. Lavaredo Ultra Trail, ItalyThe serene rocky monoliths of the Dolomites play host each June to this long-established race on the European mountain running calendar. Setting off late at night from the town of Cortina d’Ampezzo – host city of the 1956 Winter Olympics – the race is brilliantly supported, with large crowds lining the streets to cheer you on your way. Best of all, being in Italy, you get to feast on endless pizza after finishing the race (lavaredo.utmb.world). Speedgoat Mountain Races, USAHeld in July on the slopes of one of the biggest ski resorts in the States, Snowbird in Utah, the Speedgoat 50k takes runners up gruelling climbs, across tricky, rocky terrain and through the breathtaking landscape of Utah’s Wasatch mountains. With the entire course situated above 2,300m, this is one of the toughest mountain races in the US (speedgoat.utmb.world). Ultra Trail Snowdonia (UTS), WalesThe only UK race in the UTMB World Series, the UTS follows challenging trails and traverses hairy ridges, summiting the most notable peaks in the north of the Snowdonia national park. Although the series of races – over 50km, 100km and 165km – take place in July, good weather is, of course, far from guaranteed (snowdonia.utmb.world). Puerto Vallarta, MéxicoAfter crossing the Sierra Madre mountains, this race takes runners down through forests and agave plantations, into the jungle and then finally along the beach in the beautiful bay of Puerto Vallarta on Mexico’s Pacific coast. Taking place for the first time in October 2022, this new event’s longest race is 100 miles, while there are also shorter options of 100km, 50km and 20km (puerto-vallarta.utmb.world). Doi Inthanon, ThailandThis race takes place in December around the highest mountain in Thailand, Doi Inthanon, in the foothills of the Himalayas. The Doi Inthanon national park is famous for its waterfalls, remote villages and its sunsets – if you do the 170km race, you’ll run through at least one sunset and maybe even two, depending on how fast you are (inthanon.utmb.world)."
‘A run for a mate’: Kevin Sinfield’s seven ultramarathons in seven days,"Rugby league great honours former teammate Rob Burrow on day two of his challenge in aid of MND charities “This is a sponsored run,” said Kevin Sinfield of what seems to most people an unimaginable, surely superhuman challenge – runningseven ultramarathons in seven days. “In my own mind this is a run for a mate, with other mates.” Sinfield, one of the greatest players in rugby league history, has just completed day two of what will be about 275 miles of running to raise money for motor neurone disease (MND) charities. It is his third mad challenge in as many years. In 2020 Sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days to raise money and awareness in honour of his friend and former teammate Rob Burrow, who is now in the grip of the disease. Sinfield sees it as natural – obvious, almost – that he would try to help. “Just because you’ve finished playing, doesn’t mean you stop being that teammate. You try to help,” he told the Guardian. “All Rob’s former teammates have played their part and done their own bit. This is an extension of that. I’m just trying to do my little bit too.” Burrow wore the number seven shirt for Leeds and the initial plan was to raise £777,777. In the first year, more than £2.5m was raised. The following year Sinfield ran 101 miles in 24 hours, bringing the total he has raised for the cause to more than £5m. This year’s challenge is also dedicated to other sportsmen who have succumbed to MND. They are described by Sinfield as a “band of brothers” and include the formerScotlandrugby union player Doddie Weir, the ex-Liverpool and Bolton footballer Stephen Darby and the recently diagnosed former Gloucester and Leicester rugby union player Ed Slater. On Monday Sinfield ran from Melrose in the Scottish Borders to the picturesque Northumberland village of Otterburn. He was mostly on the A68 and was often accompanied by music. So in Scotland it was Flower of Scotland “and quite a lot of Proclaimers”. Crossing the border into England, Sinfield’s team played Jerusalem followed by Land of Hope and Glory. Burrow texted Sinfield 15km before he finished, saying well done for finishing day two. He was of course “taking the mickey”, but that’s the way his sense of humour works, said Sinfield. The two men met when Sinfield was 14 and Burrow 12 and they were part of the Leeds academy. They became friends in the Rhinos first team and clearly have an incredible bond. “There’s things that we’ve done together in training and on a rugby field that … we’ve had to go to some dark places together. I trust him implicitly. I’ve got so much respect for him and he’s a great friend.” He says the challenge is to raise cash and also awareness. “The funding that the disease could have had and should have had” didn’t happen in years gone by, said Sinfield. That’s changed, “but for years and years this tragic and horrible disease has ripped through families”. As Sinfield talks to the Guardian, there isn’t a hint of fatigue. He is an hour early atOtterburn Castleand it is as if he has walked there from the corner shop. Anyone who wants a selfie – and there are dozens – gets one. Is it fun, or is it torture? “It’s probably a bit of both,” Sinfield said. “I miss home – I think all the team do – so in our downtime it is important that we enjoy it. We’ve got a meal together tonight; we’ll watch the rugby and spend some time together. It is important to me that the team enjoy being here. I want this week to be the best week of their lives. I don’t know whether that is possible.” What is true is that it’s not normal to put your body through what Sinfield is putting his through. He ran the last few miles of day two with the multiple world record-breaking athlete and BBC commentator Steve Cram, who said it was an extraordinary physical and mental challenge. “It is phenomenal what he is doing, really. I once did one ultra event and I didn’t do anything for about a week after. It is about recovery, and Kevin has a body which allows him to do something like this … I am just full of admiration for him.” Oldham-born Sinfieldspent most of his professional career at Leeds Rhinos, where he became captain aged 22. He also captained England, but recently revealed on Radio 4’sDesert Island Discsthat he did little to no research into the psychology of the role. He understood rugby lads, he said, including not booking them in to five-star hotels because they would soon all “have dressing gowns and slippers on, like they think they’re on holiday. So you can’t do that for a game prep. You put them in three-star and they moan.” The result is four-star, with decent biscuits. Sinfield started his challenge at Scotland’s Murrayfield ground in Edinburgh on Sunday morning and aims to finish on Saturday at Old Trafford in Manchester during half-time of the men’s Rugby League World Cup final. The money Sinfield raises will be shared by theMotor Neurone Disease Association,Leeds Hospitals Charity,the Darby Rimmer MND Foundation,My Name’5 Doddie FoundationandMND Scotland.

‘An inordinate impact’: climate crisis leaves its footprint on trail running,"Trail running events have rapidly expanded in the last decade but extreme weather is casting a shadow on the sport More than 5,000 people lined up forUltra-Trail Australia(UTA) on the last weekend in October, making it the largest trail running event in the country and, according to the race organisers, the second-largest in the world. But the multi-day event, which includes 50km and 100km ultramarathons, nearly didn’t go ahead because of the sport’s vulnerability to extreme weather and climate change. UTA, which is owned by Ironman, was postponed in May after heavy rain, and the lead-up to the October event was again hampered by severe wet weather. The 50km and 100km courses were altered from sweeping loops through the Megalong valley in the Blue Mountains to mostly out-and-back routes with more road running. The UTA race director, Nick Christopher, says it was “a mission” to get October’s race ready, with the final courses locked in less than a month before the event. “It takes a very calculated approach to understand which trails have the capacity to withstand the runners and the rain, as well as which ones you might need to avoid,” he says. Extreme weather and climate change are also affecting the industry at bigger scales. Paul Ashton, the director of another race company,RunningWild, says the window for alpine trail running in Australia is getting smaller, and riskier, every year. “Climate change is having an inordinate impact,” he says. Ashton’s Mount Buller race used to be held in February, but too many days of extreme heat at that time of year forced it back to April. “Now I don’t do any runs basically between mid-December and early March because of the risk of bushfires,” he says. “But now you get floods and road slips and snowstorms in November. And March and April are fine.” At the end of last month La Niña took its toll as Ashton rescheduled another alpine trail run from later this month to April 2023, because oflandslips in Falls Creekafterheavy rain. Last week ski resorts were blanketed in snow after an unseasonable cold snap across the country’s south-east, just as places like Mount Buller were preparing to open their summer trails to mountain bikers and walkers. Severe weather events don’t just wreak havoc with the running calendar, they also often impact the long-term viability of walking and running trails in the landscape. “Climate change is going to be significant, especially once we get El Niño back, and the drying out and the threat of bushfires,” Ashton says. Victorian runner Ben Clark, 45, ran his seventh UTA 100km this year, and says the trail community has seen what happens when races go wrong. One of the most high-profile race tragedies occurred in 2011 when several runners were caught in a bushfire during an ultrarunning race in the Kimberley. Turia Pitt suffered burns to 60% of her body andsupreme court action against the race organisers ended in an out-of-court settlement. Last year21 runners died in Gansu, China when extreme weather hit an ultramarathon. While some people expressed disappointment at the changes to this year’s UTA event, others understood the need. “They make the changes to keep us safe and allow us to go out and do the run,” Clark says. “While there’s no incidents, we’ve got more chance of these events continuing to happen.” Despite trouble with an injury Clark finished UTA in less than 13 hours, and it was the bushfire-affected landscape that stood out on the new route. “It was very exposed, and unfortunately lots of black trees to look at,” he says. “We were just out in the sun and that part of it was unpleasant.” But the course also offered some nice surprises. “The waratahs were out in bloom, explosions of red all over the place,” Clark says. “That was very cool, not something we would ever get to see on a normal year.” Christopher acknowledges UTA “this year wasn’t the cleanest run”. “But when you talk to people that ran the race afterwards, the excitement and joy, and the new challenge that was presented to them definitely outweighs a little bit of a wait to get that information,” he says. Trail running events have rapidly expanded in the last decade – from less than 10 events to more than 300 in 2022, most with multiple distances on offer from 1km to more than 300km. Tour De Trails director and tourism consultant, Chris Ord, says the sport’s growth spurt has been fuelled by people’s desire to be outdoors and a low barrier to entry. Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion “You don’t need to spend a lot of money,” he says. “And you’ve got a low skill threshold. At the very core of trail running is this idea of a return to nature. You get the mental health benefits of being in nature and being active at the same time. That is a very addictive thing … Generally once you’re in, you’re just absolutely hooked on trial running.” Ord says technology improvements have also encouraged people to try trail running. “You can jump online and there’ll be a Facebook group that covers the region you’re trying to run in,” he says. “There’ll be a million different mapping applications … you’ve got all this access to information.” The Victorian Ultra Runners group, of which Clark is a member, has almost 3,000 active members on Facebook, where people share tips about local routes and training, and swap stories from events. Clark started trail running in 2012 and remembers the humble beginnings. “In those first few years, you’d turn up for a race and you pretty much know everyone who was there,” he says. “Whereas now you turn up and you may not know anyone.” After getting “wet, muddy and filthy” on his first trail run Clark made the switch from road running. “I just had an absolute blast and thought, ‘Oh, this is brilliant. Where else can you run around in the mud and it’s socially acceptable?’ And then it just kind of snowballed from there.” And so did the sport in Australia. Trail running is running on any natural unpaved surface, usually on bushwalking tracks and often with a good dose of steep hills. When Ashton started Running Wild in 2000 his races had about 10 runners each, they now average 200 runners an event. Ord says trail running has “an alchemy that I just don’t think exists in pretty much any other sort of pursuit”. “I guess maybe bushwalking. If you magnify the benefits and fun of bushwalking – that’s trail running.” The flip side of the climate challenge is that because people take part in the sport to be in nature, Ord says more become advocates for the environment. “Trail running is one of the jigsaw pieces that gets people out to see it, experience it, love it, value it, fight for it.”"
Kevin Sinfield to run seven ultramarathons in seven days for MND,"Kevin Sinfield will run seven ultramarathons in seven days in November as he continues his campaign to raise money and awareness to help people affected by motor neurone disease. This is the third challenge in as many years taken on by Sinfield, whose great friend and former Leeds Rhinos teammate Rob Burrow has the condition. Sinfield, 42, previously ranseven marathons in seven daysin 2020 before running from Leicester Tigers’ home ground Welford Road, where he is defence coach, to the Rhinos’ Headingley stadium in under 24 hours last October, raising more than £5m. This time Sinfield will run from Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh to Old Trafford in Manchester, visiting Melrose, Newcastle, Middlesbrough, York, Leeds and Bradford and covering more than 60km per day. He will start on Sunday 13 November and is aiming to arrive at Old Trafford at half-time during the Rugby League World Cup Final the following Saturday. Burrow is one of several former sportsmen fighting MND, including rugby union’s Doddie Weir and Ed Slater and the footballer Stephen Darby. The main beneficiaries of the challenge will be the MND Association and Leeds Hospitals Charity’s appeal to build the Rob Burrow Centre for MND in Leeds, while there will also be donations to MND Scotland, My Name’5 Doddie Foundation, the Darby Rimmer MND Foundation and the 4ED campaign. Sinfield told therhinos.co.uk: “Undoubtedly this will be the toughest challenge yet. We have tried to combine elements of our two previous events to create the Ultra 7 in 7. “People living with MND have no choice but to live with their condition every day and they are inspiration for all of us taking part in the challenge. There has been some exciting news in recent days about current drug trials and we can all feel that a breakthrough is close. “MND is not incurable, it has just been underfunded, and I have belief that by raising funds we can give the scientists and researchers the best possible opportunity to find that cure. We also need to help those living with MND, to give them hope and love so they know we are with them.” Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Burrow, who celebrated his 40th birthday on Monday, added: “I’ve said it many times before, everyone should have a friend like Kevin. I am sure this will be tough and I can’t wait to see Kevin and the guys along the way to cheer them on. “People have already been so generous over the last two years and, as a patron of the MND Association, I would like to say a massive thank you, your support has made the world of difference to so many people. Go safe Kev and please support them as much as you can.”"
How hyper-local forecasts can improve safety on mountains,"New models explain conditions that led to 21 runners dying at China event, and could help improve accuracy of future forecasts In late May 2021, 172 runners set out to tackle a 100km ultramarathon in north-west China. By the next day21 of the runners had been killedby hypothermia after an unexpectedly intense storm brought freezing temperatures, strong winds and hail to an upland section of the course. Weather forecasts had predicted a cold front, but had not captured how extreme the conditions would be. There are no meteorological stations in the area and survivor reports are subjective, but now a new hyper-local weather model – using topographic data at tens of metre resolution rather than kilometres – indicates that the intense wind and rain caused temperatures to drop by 6.7°C. Taking the blizzard-like conditions into account and the effect of wet clothes on body temperature, the study – which is published in theJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres– estimates that runners would have experienced an apparent temperature of -10°C. Storms like this are common at high altitudes on mountains like Everest, and while rarer at lower elevations, their sudden arrival makes them particularly dangerous. The researchers suggest hyper-local weather models can improve forecast accuracy for mountain events, where steep mountain slopes generate highly localised effects on wind, rain and temperature at a scale too small to be picked up by conventional weather forecasts."
Laurence Brophy obituary,"Laurie Brophy, my daughter-in-law’s father, who has died aged 90 from oesophageal cancer, was deeply involved in his local community in Pencoed, near Bridgend, south Wales, inspiring others with his voluntary work and fundraising for thehomeless charity Llamauand thechildren’s disability charity Y Bont. His first major fundraising exploit came on a very hot day in 1997, running the London Marathon in a fur badger suit in aid of badger protection. Two years later, he ran his first ultra-marathon, theMarathon des Sables, a brutal six-day 156-mile race across the Sahara, the oldest competitor at 67. He did several more ultra-marathons, his last aged 79, in the Atacama desert. Born in Battersea, south-west London, Laurence was the son of Mabel (nee Thomas), a housemaid, and John Brophy, a stonemason. He was educated at King Edward grammar school, Birmingham, and joined the insurance industry, but after the death of his sister Patricia in 1962 left to travel around Europe. He settled in Italy for a while before returning to study Italian at Cardiff University, graduating in the early 1960s, and train as a teacher. At university he met Ruth Jones, an Italian and German teacher, and, after they married in 1969, they settled in Pencoed, where Laurie taught French and Italian at the local comprehensive school for nine years, working as a supply teacher for nine further years before retiring. In an active retirement, Laurie was involved in badger protection, often sleeping out in woodlands to protect setts from baiting, as well as litter picking and other community activities. He was a founder member of the Bridgend Astronomical Society and a member of the Green party, for which he stood at the 2015 election. He spent a lot of time helping in local primary schools, taking the children running, nature-watching and fossil-hunting. Laurie was a kind man with great humility. He was an adventurer, living a life full of challenges with limited resources. On his last ultra-marathon he was hospitalised with a kidney problem, so was not allowed to enter again. Unhappy about being told he was too old to race, he went to Chile the following year to attempt the distance solo. He then began his journeys by foot and bike closer to home, giving himself an annual fundraising challenge. He walked the length of Offa’s Dyke and the Taff Trail and cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats to raise funds for Llamau, at 88 the oldest person to complete this journey. He often slept on the roadside during this challenge to raise awareness of homelessness. Aged 89, his final adventure was to cycle and climb the three Welsh peaks, Pen y Fan, Cadair Idris and Snowdon. He did not know at the time that he had cancer, but he completed the challenge with the support of fellow climbers. Ruth survives him, as do their daughters, Katy and Sam, and five grandchildren, Raven, Noah, Seth, Felix and Joni."
The Barkley Marathons: the hellish 100-mile race with 15 finishers in 36 years,"Participants in the Tennessee race must negotiate extreme temperatures, wild terrain and more than 50,000 feet of accumulated ascent At 6.54am on 8 March 2022, 39-year old Johanna Bygdell from Sweden was perched next to her tent in the middle of Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee, eating breakfast with her boyfriend when she finally heard the noise she had been both craving and dreading. It was the blowing of a conch, marking one hour until the start of arguably the world’s most hellish race: the Barkley Marathons. “Finally, let’s get the party started,” she thought. Bygdell made her final preparations, packing clothes and food, and honed in on her goal of finishing the annual 100-mile ultra endurance challenge. This year, around 40 other determined runners from around the world gathered behind the race’s famous starting line, a yellow gate, with the same hope. But finishing the Barkley Marathons is an anomaly. Since its conception in 1986, only 15 runners have managed to conquer the merciless course – which features punishing sections with names such as Checkmate Hill, Little Hell, Rat Jaw and Testicle Spectacle. Most years see no finishers at all in the race’s 60-hour time limit. And 2022 was no exception. Despite no one finishing, one Barkley first-timer, Jasmin Paris, beat the clock to become the first woman in a decade to complete three loops – otherwise known as the ‘fun run’. “This was one of the years that the Barkley felt like an entity in itself, picking people off one at a time that you thought would finish,” says race director Gary ‘Lazarus Lake’ Cantrell (most runners just call him ‘Laz’), who co-founded the race in the decade followingthe 1977 breakout of Martin Luther King’s assassin, James Earl Ray, from the nearby Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary. During his 55 hours of freedom, Ray covered just 12 miles of ground. “I could do at least 100,” mocked Laz. As is tradition, Laz lights a cigarette to kick things off – an unorthodox start for an unorthodox race. When the embers glow, participants have just 60 hours to complete five rounds of the same unmarked 20 mile (give-or-take) loop: twice clockwise, twice counterclockwise, with the leading runner dictating the final loop direction – if any make it that far. One hundred miles in 60 hours may not seem too tough a task – after all the world record for the distance on footis just under 11 hours. But the Barkley Marathons course is unmarked (competitors are allowed a map and compass), has an accumulated ascent of more than 50,000 feet through thick woodland, and is subject to temperature extremes. “The first lap was run in really hot conditions, too hot for my liking, and then the second lap was the opposite, unbelievably cold with lots of rain,”said British runner Nicky Spinksafter competing in the 2019 race. All the while, racers must locate books hidden along the route as proof of completion. That task was something first timer Enrico Frigeri, a 34-year old teacher and personal trainer from Brazil, struggled with amidst the gnarled terrain and extreme weather. After completing the first loop alongside a race veteran, Frigeri entered loop two alone, but struggled to navigate the course and therefore locate the books in time. “It was then I knew that Barkley had won,” he says. Still it was an impressive feat, given that he only began training for the event 45 days prior, after being hospitalised for three months. “Just completing the loop was fantastic. I feel very satisfied,” he says. With no official race website, quirky race legends are left to reverberate within the running community – some true, some not. After paying just $1.60 to apply, successful entrants receive a ‘letter of condolence’. “Virgins” (first-timers) must contribute a licence plate from their home state or country as part of their race fee, while returning competitors must submit an additional requested item. Changing from year to year, previous examples include a pair of socks and a flannel shirt. In the rare instance a previous race victor returns to take on the course, a pack of Camel cigarettes suffices as payment: the antithesis of modern-day ultrarunning race fees, which can sometimes be upwards of $1,000 for well-known races. Laz chuckles when asked about the “human sacrifice”. He or she is the runner Laz allegedly believes is the least likely to complete a lap, and is assigned the No 1 bib. “It’s a common misconception,” he says. “People write in and say ‘I want to be the human sacrifice, I’ll be terrible!’ No. Everyone who’s there are accomplished runners. Everyone who’s there belongs. The people who are the human sacrifice are the people who don’t want to be the human sacrifice.” Race veterans play a crucial role in the race, with their accrued knowledge helping to maximise their chances of succeeding. “You have to have a mix of people,” says Laz. “Very few people are going to give their best effort the first time. So once people have gone through this whole process, you try to give people the chance to give their best effort out there. If everyone was new then it would be catastrophic.” With plenty of veterans returning this year, includingrecord-breaking ultra runner Courtney Dauwalter, Laz is surprised 2022 didn’t produce a champion. “You’re always rooting for people to complete it. You know how much they put into it and how high their hopes are, but you can’t always count on it. I really thought we would have a finisher this year,” he says. One veteran, Tomokazu Iraha, a 44-year old running coach from Japan, was “very pumped” to return for his third attempt at the race after an involuntary hiatus due to the pandemic.Runningwith two years of Barkley experience behind him, Iraha felt confident. “I was mostly on my own unlike the past two attempts,” he says. “It felt great!” Despite his experience, however, he was one of the earliest to be “doomed”, according to Laz – proof that predicting the Barkley is a fool’s game. Iraha fell and hit his knee on a rock during the first loop, and time constraints forced him to pull out after the second. “By the time I got to Little Hell, the heavy rain made the steep climb very slippery, so it was like moving three steps forward and sliding two steps back,” says Iraha. “My feet [were] wet and cold until finally they became numb. I had five hours … to make it under the loop two cut-off [26 hours 40 minutes], but not for a five loop cut-off. So the best I could have done at this point was a fun run. “When you are fresh and in a different mind set, you think you should go for that third loop. But after you are beaten down and have a low body core temperature after a very cold and rainy night, you don’t have that mindset anymore. I touched the yellow gate at 26:15:27, giving me enough time [to consider] a third loop turnover. Laz and all the others encouraged me to go for it: ‘You’ve got this, Tomo!’. So I went to the bathroom to rethink as I sat underneath a warm shower to bring my body temperature back up … but my body refused to go back … my third Barkley was over.” Like others, however, Iraha is undeterred; he aspires to be the first Asian man to finish the Barkley. “It’s kind of scary to do a challenge when there’s such a high chance for failure,” he says. “But I am sure that’s the beauty of the Barkleys. And that’s why I’m hooked so much.” Laz shares Iraha’s optimism for 2023. “You’ve got people that are ready,” he says. But it is the Barkley Marathons after all. “You never know what’s going to happen.”"
John Kelly breaks record for scaling all 214 Wainwright fells in the Lake District,"37-year-old data scientist completed feat many walkers see as a lifetime challenge in five and a half days A former World of Warcraft fanatic who was “good but not great” at running at school has broken the record for scaling all 214 Wainwright fells in theLake District. Many walkers set themselves a lifetime challenge of summiting every peak in Alfred Wainwright’s seven-volume Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. John Kelly, a 37-year-old data scientist from Tennessee in the US, completed them all in five days, 12 hours and 14 minutes. He slept between one and 2.5 hours a night, taking micro-naps in a camper van at 25 meeting points along the way. “I’m told I napped between bites of pizza at one point,” he told the Guardian. He attempted to eat 300 calories every hour, but said it was impossible to replace the energy he burned each day. The father of four smashed therecord set last year by Sabrina Verjee– who supported him in this attempt – by about 11 hours. He was also assisted byNicky Spinks, a breast cancer survivorwho has broken numerous fell running records; evidence, he says “of just how supportive and strong theultrarunningcommunity is”. The 320-mile (515km) challenge, which includes England’s highest mountain, Scafell Pike, involves a total ascent of 36,000m (118,000ft). Kelly had to abort his first attempt at the challenge last July after suffering with heat and foot problems. His children – five-year-old twins, an 8-year-old and a 19-month-old – joined him for the last leg of the run on Saturday. “It was kind of funny because I had to ask my eight-year-old to slow down because he ran off so fast,” said Kelly. He insisted he was never a brilliant athlete growing up. “I ran cross-country and did athletics at school, but I wasn’t the top person on the team. I was good, but not great; I could do 5km in around 17 minutes.” His training for ultrarunning mostly takes place on his daily commute, running 10km to and from his office in Bristol, where he is the tech co-founder at Envelop Risk Analytics. Onhis website, where he calls himself the Random Forest Runner, Kelly describes his previous passions, saying he “used to be a pretty serious water-skier. AndWorld of Warcraftplayer. But now just family, work, and running.” Asked by the Guardian why he runs, Kelly said: “Facing these types of challenges that put us at our absolute limits really strips us down to who we are: what our strengths are, what our weaknesses are. We learn how to leverage those, how to mitigate them. And I get to do this while doing an activity I love, which is being out in the mountains and exploring as many of them as possible in the time I have.” Kelly is a winner of the Barkley Marathons, often described as the world’s toughest endurance race, which sees competitors try to run 100 miles within 60 hours in the Tennessee wilderness. He also holds the record for completing all 258 miles of the Pennine Way, finishing in 58 hours and 4 minutes last May. In addition, he has completed the Grand Round (the Paddy Buckley Round in Wales, the Bob Graham Round in theLake District, and the Ramsay Round in the Highlands) continuously, linking them by bike. He and his family are returning to the US at the end of the month, and his next challenge is the 100-mile Hardrock race in Colorado."
Weatherwatch: how forecasting played role in ultramarathon disaster,"Safety warnings were not issued before tragedy in which 21 runners died in Gansu, China One word in a weather forecast could mean the difference between life and death. In May, ultramarathon runners were crossing a stretch of the Yellow River Stone Forest Park in north-west China when the temperature dropped suddenly and they werestruck by gale-force winds and freezing rain. The runners were wearing only shorts and T-shirts. They had foil blankets for protection from hypothermia, but these were insufficient and21 runners diedof cold and exposure. Chinese media were outraged because the bad weather had been predicted. A study into the catastrophe concluded that the problem lay with the process of turning weather forecasts into public communication. Weather forecasts drive impact forecasts which in turn drive weather warnings. Analysis in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences noted that while meteorologists did predict a “high impact event”, this would not normally have presented a significant hazard, and so did not lead to safety warnings. The disaster happened because on this particular day the area was occupied by hundreds of lightly dressed runners who were at much greater risk of exposure than locals. What seems a linguistic nuance, the distinction between high impact and high risk, led to the tragic deaths of 21 people. Chinese authorities say they will strive for better weather communications and hazard assessments in future."
‘They’re a little crazy’: the ultramarathon runners crossing Death Valley – in a drought,"A hundred athletes are picked each year for the 135-mile race. This time the climate was especially brutal In the Badwater Basin at the bottom of California’s Death Valley, the air feels like a giant hair dryer and the pavement can melt the soles of your shoes. Yet on Monday night, 100 of the world’s top endurance runners set off on what has become known as “the world’s toughest foot race”, carving 135 miles of terrain through one of the planet’s most extreme climates at the most intense time of year. Only 100 runners are selected from around the world each year to compete in the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon. Last year it was cancelled due to the pandemic – but this year the race was back on, even in the face of a historic drought and unprecedented heatwaves. On 9 July, Death Valleyhit 130F(54.4C), the highest recorded in the valley – and on Earth – since 1913. “We all think they’re a little crazy,” said Abby Wines, a spokesperson for Death Valley national park, “but we’re in awe of them as ultra-athletes.” Wines watched the first wave of 33 runners leave the starting line at 8pm on Monday night. At that late hour, the big white digital thermometer in front of the park’s Furnace Creek Visitor Center read 110F but by the time the racers were finishing crossing the flat expanse of the valley Tuesday afternoon, temperatures were closer to 115F. Wines said the competitors drew both admiration and head-shaking from the 145 hardy souls who live in the valley full time: “Even living here, we all struggle with the heat.” Ultramarathoning has boomed in popularity in recent years but hasalso faced criticismfor its dangers; in May this year, 21 ultramarathoners died in Chinaamid extreme weather conditions. But for many ultrarunners, it’s the sheer scale of the challenge that draws them to the Badwater race. “It’s unlike any other race on Earth,” said Dean Karnazes, who has run the Badwater 11 times, dropping out only once after collapsing in the heat. “Not only is there the heat, but there is a ferocious headwind, like having a blow dryer in your face. Everyone runs on the white line, because the asphalt can melt your tennis shoes.” Runners go to extreme lengths to prepare their bodies for the heat. For Karnazes, who did not race this year, that meant doing sit-ups and push-ups in the sauna at his gym. He’d also drive to Death Valley for the race wearing several layers of parkas with the heat in his car turned all the way up. The race climbs from the lowest elevation in North America, at 280ft (85m) below sea level, to where the road ends on the way up Mount Whitney in the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains, at 8,360ft. Each runner is trailed by their own support crew in an air-conditioned minivan, which leap-frogs their progress, stopping every few miles to provide them gushes of water from spray bottles, electrolytes, ice cubes, snacks and extra changes of shoes. Race organizers also provide medical staff and are required by the park to provide their own ambulances. This is essential, Wines said, because the closest real emergency hospital is 125 miles away in Las Vegas and helicopters can’t fly in heat greater than 118F. The park’s rangers get several calls a week to rescue visitors who are experiencing symptoms of heat illness, but the race has not produced any serious injuries, Wines added. The race takes place over a 48-hour period. By Tuesday night, Harvey Lewis, a Cincinnati high school teacher and 10-time competitor, had won,clocking a time of 25 hours and 50 minutes through the course. A few hours later, the noted ultramarathon runner Sally McRae, 42, won the women’s division, crossing the finish line around 6am on Wednesday. Though many international competitors were unable to travel for this year’s race due to the pandemic, the runners represented 17 countries and 29 states, including 24 women and 60 men, with entrants ranging in age from 28 to 76. There is no prize money for the race, but those who finish in less than 48 hours receive a coveted Badwater 135 belt buckle. “To even apply to enter the race, the runners have to have done a series of other tough ultra races,” said the race director, Chris Kostman, in aninterview last week on Accuweather TV. He said a committee then studied the qualifications of each runner. “It’s much more detailed than applying to a college or getting a job, because our goal is to host a race with people who are capable of finishing the race.” Arnold Begay of Tulsa, 58, was attempting to finish the race for a second time, representing the Navajo Nation. On the podcastRun the Riot, he said his childhood living on an Arizona reservation with no electricity or water had given him the preparation he needed for this kind of event. But, he said, his first run of the course in 2009 had been much worse than he had ever expected. “It was like my gut was torn out,” he said. “I took a beating. I have never experienced this kind of agony.” But he said somehow, after working as a support crew member in the last race in 2019, he was drawn to do it again. It appeared from the race stats that Begay dropped out some time after completing the first 42 miles nearly 12 hours into the race. While Karnazes won the race in 2004, it is the many pitfalls and misadventures of the course he remembers most vividly. “I don’t like to say I won, I just survived the fastest,” he said. He remembers passing rattlesnakes, scorpions and tarantulas, who come to warm themselves on the road at night, and having his crew take his temperature and feed him whole chunks of ice to make sure his core temperature wasn’t shooting towards heatstroke. He said that runners’ feet swelled so much, as they made their way through the heat and up the three major climbs of the relentless course, that competitors regularly carried several bigger shoe sizes so they could upsize during the race. Runners often covered themselves head-to-toe in white, UV-resistant fabrics to avoid blistering, he said. Nevertheless, the glaring reflection of sun off the road could sunburn the inside of your nostrils or the roof of your mouth. Karnazes, who wrote about the Badwater race in his bookA Runner’s High, remembers the first time he ran the Badwater – and failed to finish – in 1995. The RV he had rented for his support crew had blown up and he had tried to go on by himself without help. He said the crew had eventually found him passed out on the roadway and had taken him to a hotel to revive him. He had woken up wondering why he wasn’t still in the race, but he was determined to come back and do it again and again. “There’s magic in misery,” said Karnazes, who still runs ultramarathons but promised his family he would give up the grueling Badwater, after he ran his 10th race in 2013. He admits he’s still drawn by the sheer hell of it. “I’m very tempted,” he said. “I’ll probably go back.” Wines says the stamina of the runners is refreshing for park rangers who are used to people making extremely short summer visits to the park. “In the summer, most people just drive through and take a picture of the thermometer,” Wines said. “They jump out of their air-conditioned cars, feel the heat and then get back in again. Which is fine, because regular people, who aren’t acclimated to the heat, shouldn’t push it.” But, she said, these racers “are putting themselves up against the landscape at the most extreme time of the year, which is an admirable way of experiencing it”."
Sabrina Verjee sets record for running 214 Wainwright peaks in less than six days,"The British ultrarunner Sabrina Verjee has shattered the record for completing all of the Lake District’s 214 Wainwright peaks in less than six days – making her the fastest athlete, male or female, by more than six hours. The 40-year-old veterinary surgeon from Ambleside finished the 325-mile route, which included the summit of England’s highest mountain, Scafell Pike, in five days, 23 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds to beat the previous best, set by Paul Tierney in 2019. Verjee said she had only stopped only for food, running repairs and, very occasionally, for two or three hours’ sleep or rest. “It feels absolutely awesome,” she said after finishing early on Wednesday morning. “My body held out better than I expected and I was able to maintain a good pace throughout. “The Wainwrights have become an obsession and I felt that I could and should complete a round in under six days, so I am over the moon to have proved myself right and finally put it to bed,” she added. “And if what I have done inspires more people – especially girls and women – to get out there and challenge themselves, then that’s an added bonus.” Verjee’s extraordinary achievement, which included 36,000 metres of ascent, is the latest in a growing trend of records set by women in long-distance races. In January 2019, the British ultrarunner Jasmin Paris became thefirst woman to win the 268-mile Montane Spine Racealong the Pennine Way – shattering the course record by 12 hours while also expressing breast milk for her baby at aid stations along the route. Eight months later the US swimmer Sarah Thomas became the first woman toswim the Channel four times in a row, a feat that took her 54 hours and 10 minutes. More recently another American, Maggie Guterl, became the first woman to win theBig Dog Backyard Ultra in Tennessee, where the last man or woman standing wins. She ran for 60 hours and covered 250 miles. Verjee is well-known in ultrarunner circles, and last year set the record for the fastest known female time on the Pennine Way, completing the 268 miles in three days 2hr 28min. In 2020, she was the first woman to run the Wainwrights, which get their name from Alfred Wainwright’s seven-volume Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, in six days, 17hr and 51 min. It was the third-fastest time ever but Verjee said that she did not want it to be considered for records as she had needed substantial support from fellow runners after suffering a knee injury. An attempt at the overall record in May had to be abandoned due to sub-zero conditions and blizzards that led to an exacerbation of her asthma and caused breathing problems. After pulling out, she said: “This story isn’t over. I love running and I love exploring the Wainwrights. We have unfinished business.” It proved to be a case as Verjee, whose latest record attempt began from her home in Langdale last Friday, was always ahead of her target time. As she neared her goal she attracted a growing online following, who sent her messages via her tracking app, that were passed on to her as she ran. “It was really nice to have these little pick-ups, with people saying I’ve inspired them or their children to go out running,” she added. Verjee also paid tribute to her husband, Ben, and a large support crew of friends, for helping her before suggesting she would now move onto fresh targets. “I couldn’t have done it without them – so I wouldn’t want to put them through another one!” she added."
‘These races are epic’: why ultrarunning is soaring in popularity,"The events can be gruelling and even dangerous, yet more and more people are signing up John Stocker hadn’t slept in three-and-a-half days when he finally crossed the finish line after running more than 337 miles in an ultramarathon event in Suffolk, stopping only at brief intervals for food and rest. Of the 123 people who started the race in Knettishall Heath on 5 June, he was the last person still running 81 hours later on Tuesday evening, and had to summon all of his physical and mental strength to get around the last lap. “Your tiredness just takes over. And then I clipped my toe and went down on the concrete. I laid there thinking I wasn’t going to be getting back up,” the 41-year-old personal trainer said, as he recovered at home in Bicester. “But the whole reason I do these ultras is to show my kids that they should try to achieve as much as they can, and not be told by anyone that they can’t do something. That’s what kept me going.” Ultrarunning has soared in popularity, with areport in Mayshowing a 345% increase in participation globally over the past 10 years and thousands of events taking place annually. Meanwhile, participation in 5Ks has declined since 2015, and participation in marathons has levelled off. The term broadly refers to any race over the length of a marathon, and can come in many shapes and forms – including the six-day, 251kmMarathon des Sablesacross the Sahara, and theSpine Raceacross the Pennine hills covering 431km. “It has been an explosion. When I came to ultrarunning about 14 years ago, I did a Google search and found about 60 races. Now we estimate there’s probably about 10,000,” said Steve Diedrich, the founder of the website Run Ultra. “The pandemic put people into two categories: the people who sat on the couch and the people who got off the couch. And those who got off the couch have pushed themselves further and become ultrarunners.” Adharanand Finn, the author of The Rise of the Ultra Runners, said: “Generally as running has got more popular and more people have done marathons there’s a natural inflation. To tell people you’ve run a marathon is maybe not as impressive as it once was. “These races are so epic and so huge, people are so impressed and it’s easy to get sucked in by that.” The UK has a long history of ultrarunning in the form of fell races, but races specifically labelled as ultras are on the increase. The “back yard challenge” races, which originated in the US, are particularly gruelling; at the Suffolk event participants had to run a 4.167-mile (7km) route every hour until they could no longer carry on. If runners complete their lap early they can take a short break to sleep, eat and use the toilet before heading back to the start line. “It’s like Groundhog Day. Because you get back to the tent and you’ve got a few minutes and then all of a sudden it’s your next loop, it starts all over again,” said Stocker. “I still have nightmares now of them blowing the whistle over and over again.” Along with his fellow runner Matthew Blackburn, he beat the world record for the event previously held by Karel Sabbe, a Belgian dentist who ran 312.5 miles (502km) in 75 hours in October. Now the pair will head to Tennessee to take part in the back yard ultra world championships and compete against the best in the field. The races are not without risk. The ultrarunning community is still reeling from thedeaths of 21 runnersin an ultramarathon event in China last month after high winds and freezing rain hit the course. The countryhas suspended all long-distance racesand an investigation into the tragedy is being carried out. “Through the history of ultraracing there have been issues with floods, cold exposure, heat exposure, a range of everything depending on the location,” but deaths are very rare, said Diedrich. In its 35-year history, two people have died taking part in the Marathon Des Sables. “We have to have some sort of a safety net, because you’re asking people to push to the absolute limit of their exhaustion,” said Lindley Chambers, the owner of ChallengeRunning, which organised last week’s Suffolk back yard ultra. He said the route was carefully mapped out to avoid risk of injury and staff were on hand to aid runners at all times. “You need to be sensible, and manage the risks as best you can,” he said. “But then on the other side, the runners want it to feel like an adventure, they want to feel like they’re challenged. They don’t want you to hold their hand all the way round.”"
China bans extreme sports in wake of Gansu ultramarathon tragedy,"Authorities crack down on sports including trail running and wingsuit flying ahead of centenary celebrations China has indefinitely suspended extreme sports events, including ultramarathons, trail running and wingsuit flying, in response to the deaths of 21 long-distance runners in Gansu last month. Extreme weather hitYellow River Stone Forest trail racein Gansu province a few hours into the race on 22 May as many of the competitors were crossing a remote and treacherous part of the 100km mountain track. Of the 172 competitors,21 diedand eight were injured. Scores of competitors sheltered in caves, some rescued by residents from nearby villages. On Wednesday the General Administration of Sportannouncedan indefinite suspension of all “high-risk sports events with unclear management responsibilities, imperfect rules and unclear safety protection standards”. These included cross-country running, wingsuit flying, ultramarathons and desert races, “in order to fully guarantee the health and to safeguard the lives of the people”, it said. “The General Administration of Sport will conduct a comprehensive review of sports events, accelerate improvements of the management system, improve standards and regulations, and comprehensively strengthen management to ensure the safety of sports events.” The administration’s statement also ordered local authorities not to hold competitive sport events unless necessary, and to cancel any other high-risk events in the lead-up to next month’s celebrations of the Chinese Communist party’s centenary, in order to ensure “a good environment and atmosphere”. It said local governments must conduct risk assessments of competitive activities and related services including safety management, analysis of weather and geological conditions, and emergency rescue. The suspensionwas first reported by the South China Morning Post. In the wake of the Gansu race, numerous marathons and running events were postponed or cancelled. Family members and survivors demanded accountability for what some said was a “manmade disaster”. In its announcement, the administration said the incident was “in part due to sudden changes in weather [and] caused a great loss of human life – a lesson imbued with deeply felt grief.” Among the concerns raised about the disaster were an apparent lack of awareness of the changing weather, the lack of cold weather gear in the mandatory equipment list, and the long delay in cancelling the race once things began to go wrong. Multiple accounts of the Gansu disaster hinted at poor contingency plans and communication to local rescue authorities, who struggled to access the terrain and locate stranded competitors. Several hours passed between the first messages for help and the full deployment of rescue teams. Commentators also noted the explosion in popularity of endurance running in China, suggesting there were too few experienced organisers to run the hundreds of races now held every year. Tourism officials often see a race as a high-profile way to promote their region and to win favour with their superiors, potentially without enough regard for the danger. China’s high-level central commission for discipline inspection is also investigating the circumstances surrounding the tragedy."
An ultramarathon ends in tragedy: runners describe horror of Gansu race,"Twenty-one competitors died in the freezing Chinese mountains, raising major questions about safety in the sport At the starting line of the Gansu ultramarathon, it was cold but the sun was shining. One competitor struggled to warm up, even after jogging a quick 2km, and noticed some of the elite competitors were wearing shorts and shivering. In nearby towns, the temperature was reportedlyalready droppingand winds increasing, but the 172 runners didn’t know that. In a widely shared account ofthe horror that followed, published online, the anonymous runner described the conditions that led to the death of 21 competitors and the admission of eight others to hospital, and sparked major questions about the safety of the increasingly popular endurance sport in China. Within hours, the temperature on the mountain in north-westernChinawould drop far below zero. Runners were pelted with rain, hail and gale-force winds. Competitors have described being blindsided by the cold, losing feeling in their extremities, passing people who retired early and were descending the track, and coming across others who were foaming at the mouth or lying motionless. Among those who died during the Huanghe Shilin Mountain Marathon in Gansu’sYellow River Stone Forest was record-holder Liang Jing, last photographed leading the pack, wearing shorts and a thin jacket. Nicknamed Liang God, the 31-year-old father of a two-year-old was well known in China as a champion racer. He was experienced, having won – among others – a 250-mile (400km) race through the Gobi desert in 2018. According to China News Weekly, he was one of four competitors who sheltered in a cave, accompanied by two local villagers. By the time rescuers found them, three of the four, including Liang, had died. Paralympian Huang Ganjun also died during the race. Hearing- and speech-impaired, Huang won the men’s hearing-impaired marathon at the 2019 National Paralympic Games. A friend described him as a “sensitive” man whose greatest joy in life was running. Fellow competitor Zhang Xiaotao described seeing Huang between the two checkpoints, alive and continuing but “in bad shape”. The Gansu ultramarathon had been run three times before, but this was a new route, through remote mountain territory. The weather deteriorated between the second and third checkpoints: a five-mile stretch of trail, 15 miles into the route. Competitors have variously described it as a treacherous and technical part of the route with 1,000 metres of elevation, requiring some climbing. “There is nowhere to rest and you can’t stop and the exposed mountains … But on this day, the problems were magnified,” the anonymous competitor said. Wang Jin-ming, 42, was among the runners who ended up in hospital. He told China News the weather turned at about 1pm, after he had run 17 miles. He struggled for 20 minutes to open his emergency blanket, only for it to be ripped out of his hands by the wind. He repeatedly pressed his GPS emergency button. “I lost control of my hands and feet, I could only crawl, keep climbing, keep climbing … I told myself that I can’t stop, must keep up my body temperature, stay alive, and see my family.” Wang said he found six or seven others, also in dire straits, and he urged them to keep moving but they couldn’t. At some point he lost consciousness and woke up in hospital. Rescuers hadn’t reached him until about 7pm. The inaccessibility of the section meant checkpoint 3 was not a supply drop for food, water or warm clothes, and those caught in the section could only rely on what they were carrying, which for many was very little. Across running forums and articles and media reports, many have questioned the lack of cold weather gear on the mandatory equipment list. A windbreaker or thermal top were only recommended, and the mandatory emergency blankets were ripped to shreds by the winds. But no one raised any objections to the list, wrote the anonymous competitor. “My jacket was packed in a transfer bag and stored at the [checkpoint 6] changing point 62km into the track. Normally, I can get here before dark.” Few made it past checkpoint 3. Estimates say 40 to 50 people took shelter in small cabins or caves along the route, some helped by dozens of locals including a shepherd, Zhu Keming, who has beenhailed as a national herofor saving six people. Wang Qinlin, the party secretary of Hu Ma Shui village, said he coordinated with a neighbouring village secretary and marshalled residents to gather winter coats, quilts, steamed buns and hot water for survivors. As the global ultramarathon community mourns its biggest ever tragedy, many are debating the role of personal responsibility. The sport is an ultimate endurance test, often in difficult or treacherous conditions. Races can, and often do, go sideways for competitors at any moment along the trails of 60 miles plus. “Trail running is the same as mountain climbing,” said Chinese mountaineer Luo Jing, who survived the race. “You have to make plans for the worst case every time, and don’t pin your hopes on others.” Luo put her survival partly down to preparation, bringing warm clothes and ensuring she had time to descend when the weather worsened. Commentators have also suggested the explosion in the popularity of endurance running in China has led to thousands of race events, with too few experienced outfits to run them. Often tourism officials see a race as a high-profile way to promote their region and to win favour with their superiors, potentially without enough regard for the danger. Accounts in the Chinese media have hinted at inadequate contingency plans, and poor communication to local rescue authorities, who struggled to access the terrain and locate stranded competitors. There is conflicting information about what weather was predicted, and what information was assessed and passed on by organisers. Areport published in Esquire, piecing together a timeline of events, revealed shambolic coordination of the rescue effort, with small teams and cars trying to reach checkpoints 2 and 4, while others including local villagers went on foot. There were several hours between the first messages for help and the full deployment of rescue teams. The incident is under investigation, and China’s sports governing body has already ordered improvements, saying there were “problems and deficiencies” in the management model for races, including contingency planning. Numerous scheduled races have been cancelled in the fallout, and families of some of the victims have demanded accountability for the deaths. Media reports of authorities preventing families from talking to each other, or of stopping families from taking the bodies back to their home towns, has only compounded worries. The anonymous runner said it was unheard of that most of the runners had dropped out of the race before organisers finally suspended it, and urged future competitors to be prepared to look after themselves in an emergency. “You can only say you’ve finished if you make it home. Safety always come first.”"
Shepherd hailed for saving six runners in deadly China ultramarathon,"Zhu Keming rescued runners during cross-country mountain race in which 21 other competitors died A shepherd has been hailed as a hero inChinaafter it emerged that he saved six stricken runners during an ultramarathon in which 21 other competitors died. Zhu Keming was trending on Weibo on Tuesday, three days after a 100km (60-mile) cross-country mountain race in the north-western province of Gansu turned deadly in freezing rain, high winds and hail. The incident triggered outrage and mourning in China, as questions swirled over why organisers apparently ignored warnings about the incoming extreme weather. Zhu was grazing his sheep on Saturday around lunchtime when the wind picked up, the rain came down and temperatures plunged, he told state media. He sought refuge in a cave where he had stored clothes and food for emergencies but while inside spotted one of the race’s 172 competitors and checked to see what was wrong because he was standing still, apparently suffering cramps. Zhu escorted the man back to the cave, massaged his freezing hands and feet, lit a fire and dried his clothes. Four more distressed runners made it into the cave and told the shepherd others were marooned outside, some unconscious. Zhu headed outside once more and, braving hail and freezing temperatures, reached a runner lying on the ground. He carried him towards the shelter and wrapped him in blankets, almost certainly saving his life. “I want to say how grateful I am to the man who saved me,” the runner, Zhang Xiaotao, wrote on Weibo. “Without him, I would have been left out there.” Zhu has been feted in China for his selfless actions, but the shepherd told state media that he was “just an ordinary person who did a very ordinary thing”. Zhu rescued three men and three women, but regrets that he was unable to do more to help others who reportedly succumbed to hypothermia. “There were still some people that could not be saved,” he said. “There were two men who were lifeless and I couldn’t do anything for them. I’m sorry.” The tragedy has thrown a renewed spotlight on the booming marathon and running industry in China, with authorities ordering organisers of events to improve safety. According to the Paper in Shanghai, five cross-country, marathon or other running races have been cancelled at short notice."
China ultramarathon: inquiry launched after 21 runners die in cold weather,"Race organisers accused of not heeding warnings after rain, hail, and gale-force winds forecast across Gansu province Chinese authorities have launched an investigation intothe death of 21 people in an ultramarathonover the weekend, as family and friends of the competitors who died in the freezing weather questioned how it was allowed to happen. A further eight runners were injured when extreme weather hit the 100km (62 miles) high-altitude race in Yellow River Stone Forest near Baiyin in north-western Gansu province. More than 700 rescuers were sent in with thermal imaging drones and radar detectors to find the 172 competitors who were running with little protective clothing other than emergency foil blankets, some of which were reportedly shredded by high winds. Local authorities have launched an investigation, while observers blamed race organisers, accusing them of not heeding weather forecasts for the province, which is often hit by extreme weather conditions. In a report on Friday, the provincial meteorological bureau had issued warnings for “sudden heavy showers, hail, lightning, [and] sudden gale-force winds” across Gansu. State media reported temperatures plunging far below zero, pelting runners with rain, hail and sleet. In response to the tragedy, China’s sports governing body ordered improvements in safety managements in national sport events, including detailed contingency plans for incidents and measures for emergency cancellations, saying there were “problems and deficiencies” in the management model for races. Among the dead were elite runners, including the 31-year-old record-holder Liang Jing, who leaves behind a two-year-old daughter, and the Paralympian Huang Ganjun. Liang had won a number of Chinese ultramarathons in recent years while Huang won the men’s hearing-impaired marathon at the 2019 National Paralympic Games. “I’m still stunned by the news. How could this happen? I can not believe it,” Liang’s father told media. Of the lead six competitors, only one – Zhang Xiaotao – reportedly survived. In a post on Weibo, Zhang described overtaking Huang, who was both speech and hearing impaired, on the mountain as the weather began to turn. He also described running with Wu Pan-rong who was in fifth place, for a time, supporting each other before they were separated. Wu is also reported to be among the dead. Zhang said he fell several times, and at one point “could not get up”. He said he covered himself with the emergency blanket and set off his GPS locator before passing out. He said he was rescued by a shepherd who had wrapped him in a blanket and carried him to a nearby cave, where several other runners were sheltering. After he regained consciousness, they descended the mountain together. “As a participant, I would like to pay my deepest condolence to my fellow runners who have passed away. May they rest in peace. My utmost appreciation to the shepherd. I would have died if he has not saved me. What he has done will never be forgotten.” The incident has prompted outrage on social media. Related Weibo hashtags and message threads have been viewed more than 120m times, with some calling it a “man-made disaster”. “It is suffocating to know that this could had been avoided. It is purely a man-made tragedy,” said a story reporting Huang’s death. At a news briefing on Sunday, Baiyin officials bowed and apologised, saying they were saddened by the tragic deaths of the runners and that they were to be blamed."
Not a sprint: endurance experts on how to make it through lockdown,"Marathon runner Eddie Izzard, solo sailor Pip Hare and explorer Levison Wood explain what they have learned about enduring the seemingly unendurable It just goes on and on, doesn’t it? Despite the millions of vaccinations, and Boris Johnson’s“roadmap” for easing the lockdown, this pandemic is feeling increasingly like an endurance test – a marathon, followed by another marathon, followed by another. Or trudging for miles and miles across the desert for day after day. Or sailing alone around the world, battling storms and loneliness. How do you keep going? There are people who know a thing or two about that – keeping going, endurance, deserts and storms. Perhaps they might even have some advice. Eddie Izzard is in Copenhagen when I speak to her. Actually she’s not – she’s in London, at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith – but she’s kind of pretending to be in Copenhagen. There’s a changing gallery of pictures of the Danish capital up on a screen. Her latest monster marathon challenge was to run one every day for 31 days, (sort of) in a different city every day, but really on a treadmill, because of lockdown. She called itA Run for Hope, to encourage people all over the world to unite to Make Humanity Great Again. Oh, and as if a marathon a day wasn’t enough, she did a standup show after each one. I didn’t realise I’d be Zooming Eddie while she was running – or that I would be part ofher live podcast/broadcast. If I had, I would have worn a new T-shirt. But she finds it useful to talk while she runs – it helps to focus the brain away from what the legs and the lungs are going through. She talked to people – famous people, normal people, the odd journalist – throughout. “If you have to form an answer in your head, it just pulls me up and out, and I can keep going at this speed, 7.5 kilometres an hour, hacking away at the time for 6½ hours.” She’s about two hours into today’s run, looking comfortable, in red joggers, trackie top and Make Humanity Great Again baseball cap, chatting away in that languid, liquid way of hers, sliding almost imperceptibly between subjects. That – talking – is something we all need to keep doing to help us through the pandemic. “On FaceTime, WhatsApp, whatever, with your friends, like you used to. Have a beer with them, sit down and have a meal with them while they’re having a meal – you can do that,” she says. One big difference between her month of marathons and everyone’s slog through the pandemic is that her ordeal is more clearly finite. But even so, we should be thinking about the end. “You’ve got to be planning things now. We know from all the other horrible pandemics through history that they do stop. I’d say plan for that.” And exercise, of course, for physical and mental health. “Get out, especially if it’s a sunny, crisp winter’s day.” Izzard believes stamina might be both acquired and in-built. The terminator gene, she calls it. “Coming out as TV/trans in 1985 was a tough mental fight – it was very toxic, the idea of being trans then. So if you can do that and come through and create a small space of calmness around yourself, then everything else doesn’t seem that hard. The first 10 marathons are hellish and then it gets a little bit better – not fantastically better, a little bit better. You know what you’re doing.” What do we do to build up our stamina? Dial M for motivation. “If you’re not motivated, you won’t do anything; if you are, you’ll do lots,” she says. “This is probably the easiest one if you want to do something healthy: put a date in your diary when you say you’re going to go and do something. Tell everyone you’re going to do it and then do it.” And do it for charity, raise some money. “Then you feel motivated that you’re helping other people. That’s the simplest way of doing something positive, and the stamina will come because you’re motivated. I’ve told everyone I’m going to do this; I can’t let them down.” When I speak by phone to Pip Hare, she’s in the Atlantic, somewhere off the coast of Brazil. She’s taking part in the Vendée Globe, the toughest race in sailing, alone around the world. “I’ve just been up the mast again,” she says, cheerfully. She doesn’t like climbing the mast, not because she’s scared of heights but because she’s aware of the danger. “Thirty metres up in the air on a moving boat in the middle of the Atlantic is an incredibly vulnerable situation,” she says, and she laughs. How does she keep going? “You need to accept that there are highs and lows, there are times when you can forge forward and times when you’re fire-fighting. You need to understand which time you’re in, take control of the environment so that you feel you are moving forward.” Objectives are important. “There has to be a deep reason why you want to do something, because you’re putting yourself mentally and physically through really tough times. You’re asking yourself to pick yourself up and carry on every time you get knocked down. To have the strength to do that, I think you need to know why.” So for her there is a sporting objective: she’s a sailor, she aspires to be the best she can in her sport. “But on a deeper level, as a human being, it makes me curious how far I can push myself. There is always going to be something to learn, something I can do better in every walk of my life. That’s what drives me on, understanding not who you are but who you want to be.” Hare can see some parallels between her situation and being in lockdown. She’s in a small environment; she can’t see her friends and family. “It’s hard because we are so used to having a life that runs itself, all of these external stimuli that encourage the behaviours that get us through the day-to-day. When they get taken away we need to replace them with something that comes from us.” Any tips? “Some really simple stuff. Go outside every single day – it really makes a difference. Natural light is the most incredible mood-changer. Exercise, obviously, as well. Just do something positive for yourself every day – it doesn’t matter what but something that makes you feel proud of yourself. And it’s a really good time to just reflect on where you want to be when this is all over. And keep in contact with people, not just for you but for them.” At the start of her solo circumnavigation, she got loads of texts from well-meaning people asking how she was. “Over and over again: ‘How are you?’ That’s not helpful. It’s actually quite exhausting when all anybody wants to know is how are you – no effort for them and high effort for me.” She told them she wanted to hear their news, what they were watching, listening to, something funny that happened. “That’s what we’re all missing, that everyday interaction. Occasionally just drop someone a random text – there doesn’t have to be a reason, just tell them something about your life. It makes me feel so much more engaged and closer to my friends.” Hare’s adventure will finish a couple of weeks after we speak; she has mixed feelings. It will be the completion of an extraordinary achievement – she will have proved herself, to herself as well as others. But none of her family or friends will be able to come and meet her in Les Sables-d’Olonne, in western France. “I’ve sailed round the world on my own and I can’t hug anyone – that’s really going to hurt.” It’s going to be a case of adapting. “‘I’ve thought quite hard about what I’m going to do. I already have some mini-objectives for 2021. And I can tell you when lockdown is lifted and we are finally allowed to gather in groups, there’s going to be one hell of a party in Poole.” Right now, though, she has got to go on deck to change a sail. When Levison Wood walked the length of the river Nile seven years ago, from source to sea, it sometimes felt as if the journey would never end. He remembers one low point in particular. “I had reached the Sahara desert in Sudan; it wasn’t even halfway and I’d already been walking for six months at that stage. I looked ahead and all I could see was endless sand.” Earlier in the trip, Matthew Power, an American journalist who had come out to walk with and write about Wood,had suddenly died of heatstroke. “All these things were weighing on my mind. To be confronted with just monotony was a really tough thing to deal with.” Wood is speaking today not from the Nile, but from his home near the banks of the Thames at Hampton Court. He has found lockdown tough, stuck at home. He broke his ankle; his dog died. “That’s really hard to deal with. But when something like that happens it’s a case of: well, right, this is shit but what’s good? Or what could be better?” He began to explore – the local park. “It’s been an opportunity to connect with my local area. I’d probably only been in Bushy Park three or four times, and suddenly I was finding these hidden gardens and things, glorious little discoveries.” And he’s been using the time to write a book, The Art ofExploration, reflecting on his travels, what he has learned from them and how it can be applied in daily life. Like Izzard and Hare, Wood talks of the importance of helping others. A Paras veteran, he volunteered for an ex-services charity called RE:ACT, helping the NHS, working in a mortuary in Hounslow. “I was stacking bodies in March and April last year. That brought it home, that this disease was clearly going to kill a lot of people. But I felt I needed to go and do my bit.” Being in the army helped him build not just resilience but patience. “Half of what you do in the army is sitting around waiting for something to happen, it’s not all bangs and action. I was in Afghanistan in 2008, and while there was plenty of action it was still about 80% sitting on your arse doing nothing. It does engender a sense of resilience and patience and keeping some kind of hope that things will improve. The same keeping hope alive can be applied to the current situation.” On his big walks (as well as the Nile, he has walked the length of the Himalayas, Central America and the Arabian peninsula) there has needed to be a natural process of resignation. “There is no point trying to change the situation – you have to try to change the way you deal with it, find a new sense of purpose from a different routine. If you’re stuck at home that means having a routine that structures your day, whether that’s doing a bit of yoga in the morning, or mindfulness, just changing your habits a bit.” It’s all too easy to fall into bad habits, “maybe having a few too many glasses of vino every night. It’s about reminding yourself that you’ve got to stay on top of things and be as positive as you can. The way I do that is by trying to remind myself of what we have to be grateful for – I know it’s a bit of a cliche, but it really does help.” Walks, lockdowns, it doesn’t matter – it’s the same. On the Nile he constantly reminded himself that no matter how tough it was for him, he was just a visitor. “Looking around, there was extreme poverty, there was conflict, people living in dire circumstances, often struggling to get clean water. When I remind myself that actually I’ve got nothing to complain about, shift my mindset a little bit to think of it that way, then things aren’t as bad as they seem.” Suddenly even miles and miles of endless sand – actual sand or the metaphorical desert of lockdown – doesn’t look so bad."
What happened when the Tarahumaras' love of ultrarunning went global?,"The book Born to Run brought attention to an indigenous Mexican’s people feats of long-distance running. A new documentary looks at what happened next Next up in ESPN’s venerable 30 for 30 series isThe Infinite Race, a documentary on a sports topic that hardly checks the biggest 30 for 30 box, in that the film does not involve a famous star athlete, sport or event. In fact, The Infinite Race kicks off with a simple story about an indigenous people’s joy of long-distance running. The documentary explores what happens to these people,the Tarahumara, who live deep in the mountains of Chihuahua, Mexico, when their love of running, or even their calling to run, spills out to the rest of the world because of a popular book about running and an American known as Caballo Blanco, or the White Horse. “It’s a story about resilience, survival and continuance,”Bernardo Ruiz, the veteran Mexican and American film-maker who directed The Infinite Race, tells the Guardian. That the 50-mile Ultra Maratón Caballo Blanco, which The Infinite Race revolves around, will be held again next March in the rugged terrain ofChihuahua’s Copper Canyonis a testament to the event’s durability. Running won out, as it has for generations among the Tarahumara, but only after the event survived a culture clash that involved a lot of dollars and pesos, good and bad. Although he directed an award-winning 2008 documentary about baseball star Roberto Clemente and says he always wanted to make a film about running, Ruiz deals with tougher subjects, like the US-Mexico drug war in his 2016 documentary Kingdom of Shadows. He says of The Infinite Race: “I liked how it was a compelling, beautiful film about running, but it also talked about social issues.” The film, which debuts on 15 December, starts a little slowly, but those who stick with it will find out much about an indigenous people’s rich past – and a future lighted by hope. The Tarahumara, or the Rarámuri, have run vast distances for years, often wearing sandals that have tire treads as soles. They say running is in their blood: isolation and geography helped them build endurance to hunt prey. They became famous after they were featured inBorn to Run, a 2009 bestseller by Christopher McDougall. The central figure of Born to Run was American ultramarathon runner Micah True, also known as Caballo Blanco, who organized a race in 2003 that would eventually become the Ultra Maratón Caballo Blanco. True hoped the race would help the Tarahumara preserve their running heritage and, more significantly, their culture, which had been battered by hunger, a lack of drinking water, a shortage of housing and global heating. True, who had wintered in the area for 10 years, offered prizes of cash and corn, a commodity: “I don’t want to see people kill themselves for corn,” he said in the documentary. He opened the event to ultramarathoners, and it became popular among Americans, who were looking for a new challenge and a new culture to explore. True died in 2012 at the age of 58 of a heart attack while running, but the event named after him continued to grow. A shorter kids’ run for “Caballitos” was offered, with bags of school supplies given to participants. The event had become commercialized, even with its own line of merchandise, but the whole region benefited from Caballo Blanco’s idea. But the region’s seclusion had also become attractive to criminal gangs, who took over farms to grow marijuana and poppy plants to smuggle into the United States, whose border is only about 550 miles to the north. People needed work, and the drug trade provided opportunities, with even distance runners hauling drugs. Gangs proliferated. So did violence. “Many families were forced out of their communities because of the violence,” Irma Chávez, an activist, explains in the film. “Unfortunately, you have to run away before they kill you.” The 2015 Ultra Maratón Caballo Blanco was supposed to be the biggest yet, but gangs all but took over the town, clouding the event with the real threat of violence. The Americans who helped organize the race, believing participants could be in danger, decided almost at the last minute to call off the official race. No vouchers for corn would be issued to participants. “They kind of intruded with a heavy hand into a runner’s paradise,” Ruiz says of the gangs. He says, “It’s been my view that the race organizers were stuck in kind of an impossible situation.” And that might have been the end of the event. But a group of Tarahumara assembled on what was supposed to be the morning of the race – and ran the course anyway, without incident. The marathon was officially back in 2017. Miguel Lara Viniegras won the 2020 race, which attracted 220 runners last March, in six hours 43 minutes. As an ultrarunner and photographer Luis Escobar says in the film, “People are looking for something big, outside of their office, outside of their home. It is a big struggle, it’s hard physically and mentally – and there’s nothing like doing it. When you complete it, you know that you can do anything.” Ruiz, who says he spent most of his career examining the love-hate relationship between the United States and Mexico, had a compelling challenge: telling a story that was not that well-known and based in a place that was very difficult to get to from the outside world. “You’d have to kind of be an ultrarunner or a sports geek to care about it,” he says. Perhaps the film won’t draw as big an audience as other ESPN documentaries because it does not include an American sports celebrity like OJ Simpson or Michael Jordan. But the 30 for 30 project, now more than a decade old, has become much deeper, delivering quality projects that are way more than mere sports movies. This is one. As Ruiz says, 30 for 30 “is a franchise that is really film-maker-driven.”"
'I ran out of excuses': lockdown raises the bar for UK ultrarunners,"As rest of UK slowed down, serious runners used the time to train harder and smash records While many of us spent a lot of time doing very little during the coronavirus lockdown, for a niche pocket of society it provided an opportunity to push themselves to the limits of physical endurance. Whileultrarunnersalso had less to do, with no races to train for, lockdown became an ideal opportunity to complete goals they had long hankered after, resulting in a number of world records being broken in the past few weeks alone. Sabrina Verjee becamethe first woman to run the Wainwrights round, a mere 318 miles (512km), while Kim Collisonbroke the Lakes 24-hour challenge recordthat had stood for 23 years. Then came Beth Pascall, whosmashed the previous Bob Graham recordheld byJasmin Paris. Meanwhile, Damian Hall set a new record time on the 268-mile Pennine Way – while also cleaning the trail of litter – and earlier this week, Carla Molinaro set a new women’s world record by running from Land’s End to John O’ Groats in 12 days, 30 minutes and 14 seconds. Molinaro and Hall say the pandemic and subsequent lockdown gave them the impetus to finally complete goals that had been on their bucket lists for years. Molinaro, 36, a running coach, started out at Land’s End at 5am on 16 July.Runningnearly 73 miles every day and fuelled by macaroni cheese, cakes, some cocktail sausages and a few pitstops at B&Bs, she didn’t even take a break to celebrate her 36th birthday. “The weather was brutal towards the end – 30mph winds and driving rain,” she said. “And then I couldn’t run on the last day because I was in so much pain and we had to walk the last bit, but we somehow got through it,” she said, as she was being driven back home to Buckinghamshire by her sister, Andrea, after completing the challenge. Despite getting blisters and having to have her toenails drilled, Molinaro, whose parents were marathon runners, took more than 10 hours off the previous record of 12 days, 11 hours and 6 minutes, set by the North Yorkshire runner Sharon Gayter last August. Molinaro, who represented Great Britain at the 100km World Championships and whose previous challenges include running 170km around Mont Blanc, began training for the feat on the driveway of her family home in South Africa. “Right at the beginning I was stuck in South Africa and we weren’t allowed to go out anywhere so I just started to do laps of the driveway – the neighbours thought I was mad,” said the former British Army operations officer. “But all races were cancelled and the pressure of training for them had been suddenly taken away. It gave me that time to do those things which had been on my bucket list for a while, but this ended up being one of the hardest things I have ever done.” Molinaro, whose inspiration included the endurance athlete Mimi Anderson, a previous record holder of the challenge, said it had been an “awesome” year for ultrarunners. “Funny, really, that we clearly all had the same thought process. And then we all made it happen and went for the records at the same time. We smashed it and didn’t just give up and sit on the couch, which was obviously tempting.” Hall agrees with Molinaro. The 44-year-old completed the Pennine Way in 61 hours 34 minutes, knocking more than three hours off the record set by his friend, the US ultrarunner John Kelly, just a week earlier. Before that, it had stood unbeaten for 31 years, belonging to Mike Hartley. “This had been on the radar for me for about four years but I’d always been intimidated by how good the previous record was so I kept making excuses, but then lockdown happened and I ran out of excuses,” says Hall. The father-of-two from Wiltshire completed the record run at 7.34pm on Friday in Edale, Derbyshire, having started at 6am on Wednesday in Kirk Yetholm, Scottish Borders. His route along Great Britain’s oldest national trail amassed more ascent than Mount Everest and included a section along Hadrian’s Wall. The climate-change campaigner, whose whole attempt was certified as “carbon negative” by Our Carbon, used the challenge to help raise funds for Greenpeace UK. He and his 11 teams of pacers also cleaned the famous trail of litter as they ran, stuffing it in their packs before handing it to support team members at road crossing meet-up points. “I feel tired and satisfied,” says Hall, who headed straight to the pub for his first pint in four months after completing the challenge. “Lockdown gave me the opportunity to start enjoying running for the sake of running again. I have flown around the world doing challenges and this made me realise sometimes we overlook what we have here.”"
'It is part of my spiritual life': the people who take running to the extreme,"What drives a group of people to run around the same New York block 5,649 times? Sanjay Rawal’s new film takes a look at the world’s longest certified footrace and the bliss of extreme running You might think that running around the sameNew Yorkcity block for 52 days straight would be an exercise in futility. Not to mention stupefyingly boring. Runners who signed up for the Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race would go around and around 164th street in Jamaica, Queens, 5,649 times, roughly 96km each day until they had run 4,898km in the world’s longest certified footrace. The race – and extreme running itself – is the subject of Sanjay Rawal’s new film, 3100 Run and Become, which is now available to stream. Watching it now – as the world’s major cities including New York are in shutdown – feels jarring, a reminder of the freedoms we have lost: to be outside in bustling streets, where people move with purpose; to run and to breathe without fear. In the film, street life in Queens surrounds the runners as they circle the same block, past the Thomas Edison high school and Joseph Austin playground, again and again. They struggle with the stifling summer heat bouncing off the pavement, the humidity, the blisters, the chafing, the carb loading, the exhaustion. The race was founded in 1996 by the late Indian guru Sri Chinmoy as a way for people to discover – and surpass – their own limits. The goal is to transcend earthly annoyances and find some kind of enlightenment. But for the most part in this film, those taking part look more as though they are descending into a particularly unpleasant version of hell, as their muscles break down. Ashprihanal Aalto, 45, tells his mentor that after winning in 2015 he doesn’t want to run the race again because he doesn’t want to suffer like that any more. But he does run it, as he has 15 times now, winning more than half of them. “I wouldn’t do it 15 years if there wasn’t something more than just a race,” he tells the Guardian. “For me it is part of my spiritual life … You try to quiet the mind.” He was training for this year’s race when it was cancelled because of the coronavirus. Now he’s self-isolating instead: a situation he’s better trained for than most. Aalto speaks to me from Helsinki,Finland, where he is a postal worker, living an austere existence alone in a cabin. “These types of races are not for an incredibly social person” says the director, Rawal. “I would say his life of utter solicitude definitely gives him an edge over people. [Aalto] lives like a teenager, he has got boxes of chocolate under his bed. He drinks soda all the time, eats pizza. The one thing he works on his mental attitude, just to keeping his mind fluid, loose and free.” The most interesting thing about those who run this race, Rawal says, is that they are “the most ordinary people”. “One of them, Yuri [Trostenyuk, who won in 2016], is a plumber in the Ukraine. None of them are sponsored. It shows that if you have the right attitude you can accomplish what most people think is impossible.” Aalto found spirituality after his mother died. Craving time and space to reflect, he went into the forest on his own for three months, walking the 4,500km Pacific Crest Trail and then the 3,500km Appalachian Trail in the US. “After many months of hiking you become one with the forest and more sensitive, your hearing and smell becomes better,” he says. When he heard about multi-day races, something clicked: “I thought it sounded nice to be able to run all day and night.” In his film, Rawal explores the spirituality of running as it’s experienced around the world; that ability to tap into something more powerful than simply the pounding of feet. “It was this idea that running could be a prayer,” he says. He ventures from the New York race to visit Shaun Martin, a Navajo canyon runner in Chinle, Arizona, who is continuing a tradition of moving on foot that has existed for hundreds of years. He visits bushmen of Botswana, who are trying to hold on to a now-illegal tradition of hunting by running after their prey. He also talks to a Buddhist monk in Mount Hiei, Japan, who undertakes an ascetic 1,000-day challenge in rugged terrain wearing unsuitable bamboo shoes – and who is obliged to kill himself if he doesn’t complete it. Says Rawal of the monk: “It was this idea that movement and running could be used to totally transcend our ego and put us into the highest realms of spiritual consciousness. That there comes a point that the bliss totally negates any pain or discomfort. If it wasn’t for the bliss all he would think about was, ‘What if I don’t finish?’, and fear would envelope him.” Aalto says: “For some people it is spiritual music or great singers that gives their joy, their inspiration, for some people art. For me running long distances is my way of making progress, that is what keeps me motivated. As the years go by the more it is an inner thing. It is still a race but there is a kind of joy in it.” 3100: Run and Become is streaming on iTunes, Amazon, Amazon Prime and Google Play"
"Spirit Journey: one man's role in a 6,000-mile run through North America","When Noé Álvarez joined an extraordinary ultramarathon he tested himself physically and mentally, while also connecting with his heritage While jogging on the spot, Mexican-American runner Noé Álvarez showed his passport to the border agent in Nogales, Arizona. Álvarez was participating in thePeace and Dignity Journeys(PDJ), an ultramarathon for runners of indigenous background like himself. His group had run 3,200 miles from the Arctic to the US border with Mexico. They still had miles to go before their destination of the Panama Canal, but for Álvarez, the crossing into Mexico had extra meaning – it was the homeland of his parents before they immigrated to the US. The border agent, a fellow Latino, smirkingly asked if he was running in the wrong direction. It’s an emotional moment inÁlvarez’s new memoir, Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America’s Stolen Land. The book chronicles not only that epic run in 2004 but also the background of the author and his immigrant parents. “I feel like I’m still writing it,” Álvarez says. “It continues to inform my life. It took me years to figure out how I was going to tell it.” Ultimately, he decided on uniting the beauty of the journey and the messy moments along the way “through the medium of running.” And what a run it was. The PDJ is a quadrennial event intended to reconnect indigenous participants with their ancestral land, with the latest edition, which had been due to take place this year, postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In 2004, Álvarez’s group was heading south to rendezvous with another group running north from Argentina. “We ran beyond trying to burn calories,” Álvarez says. “Those [kind of] runners didn’t last. It’s bigger, larger than yourself … Before you knew it, 10, 15, 20 [miles a day] was easy,” although, he clarifies, “we were hurting afterward.” There were unexpected difficulties -- an encounter between Álvarez and a mountain lion in Oregon, stone-throwing motorists in Mexico, and tensions between the author and some of his fellow runners. And he didn’t quite finish the way he intended to. But the first-time author has come to find satisfaction in both the run and his life trajectory. Álvarez grew up in Yakima, Washington, the son of Mexican immigrants ofPurépechaheritage. His father worked in an orchard, his mother at an apple-packing plant. As a teenager, he worked with his mother at the plant, describing the days as physically demanding; he said his mother is starting to lose sensation in her hands from overwork. He also started to run, although he grew up thinking of it as a way to keep one step ahead of immigration authorities. He received a full scholarship to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, but says he felt “cultural shock on all sorts of levels. I had difficulties, there was the shame of failing, I could not save my family.” Serendipitously, he learned of the PDJ from “a friend of a friend of a friend.” “I had to do this,” Álvarez explains. “It was part of my escape. I was not connected to college at the time. It was not how I needed to learn. College was joining the run.” He joined one month in, after the group had started its journey from Alaska. Their paths crossed in British Columbia. Fellow runners collectively represented nine indigenous communities. “It was interesting to see how fluid and multilayered our identities were,” he says of his fellow participants, whom he portrays through composite characters in the book. They included runners of Mexican heritage living in Canada, and “an elder, our spiritual guide, from the Arctic.” He noted that there were “some former gang and military members and others completely living off the land,” and women runners committed to “female energy, healing power, balance.” PDJ runners start and end each day with a ceremony, and carry feathered staffs during the run. Daily destinations are indigenous communities across North America. At each stop, community members share an important cultural story with the runners, signifying the story with a feather to add to the staff. Sometimes they also shared running traditions, including running as a group in the Tohono O’odham territory in the Arizona desert. Álvarez, who had never run more than 10 miles in a day, would receive myriad tests. The PDJ takes place relay-style, with each runner committing to a certain amount of mileage each day while others wait their turn while traveling by motor vehicle. He learned to eat on the run, finding that a hard-boiled egg stuffed into his pocket might not be the wisest nourishment with wildlife around. He and his fellow runners slept in all manner of venues, from campgrounds to casinos, and encountered varying terrain, from the forests of Canada to the deserts of Washington and Arizona to the jungles of Mexico. “It was not just running blindly,” Álvarez says. “It’s a story about why land is important to people.” He noted that in the Canadian forests, trees were being cut down for the ski industry and the Winter Olympics, while more arid areas were suffering from drought. “We honored the land that a lot of people depend on,” Álvarez says. “We were physically walking, running and connecting with it every step of the way.” In Oregon, he made an unexpected connection – a mountain lion waiting for him atop a peak. “I was completely unprepared,” Álvarez recalls. “I couldn’t run back. I had to keep moving forward.” He says that when he joined the run, “one guy, a really good friend and spiritual guide, talked about how to be thankful for the presence of an animal that decides to notice you, sort of take it as a message, an opportunity to reflect.” In the book, Álvarez describes the mix of gratitude and footwork that helped him escape the big cat. “Luckily, I’m still here,” he says. “I did some studies on what you’re supposed to do, and they said definitely don’t run. It’s definitely the dumbest thing I probably ever did.” After the group crossed into Mexico, they encountered a different kind of danger: people who threw rocks from cars. Female runners were also at risk of assault; Álvarez describes one attempt that left some runners wary of continuing. “We came across situations with real shady encounters, people trying to force you into a vehicle, throw rocks at you, who didn’t want you there,” Álvarez says. “We adjusted, ran in pairs … Some territories were extremely unsafe. If you didn’t want to run, you didn’t have to. Others took on the miles.” Ultimately, it was a familiar runner’s story – injury – that determined Álvarez would finished his run in Guatemala before he could reach the Panama Canal. He calls it “the toughest decision, probably, I ever had to make.” “I didn’t want to quit,” he says. “But knowing when to quit was part of the lesson.” This lesson has stayed with him ever since – as has the border officer’s question about whether he was running in the wrong direction. “I no longer think about the wrong direction,” Álvarez says. “I have a line of inquiry now, a ritual of asking the questions I need to.” And, he says, “Running is the way I process things now.”"
‘Women have less ego. Men think: How hard can this be?’: the female ultra-athletes leading the field,"From swimming the Channel four times to outrunning every man, we meet the women at the top of their game The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. At the top of a wind-scoured hill outside Edinburgh, Jasmin Paris’s dog, Moss, patiently waits for his owner. He is, I think, wondering what on earth is taking her so long. The answer, I’m afraid, is me. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. We are in the Pentland Hills near her home – easy terrain for a skilled fell runner. For me, it’s a painful reminder that road marathons and track races do not help in the hills. I spend my clumsy descents looking at my feet, and each time I look up, Paris is defying gravity – not so much dropping as floating down. In January, Paris, then 35, made headlines across the globe when she won theSpine Race, one of those almost comically difficult events that sounds less like a run and more like a sadistic punishment: 268 miles, nonstop, along the Pennine Way. Paris took a week off from her PhD in veterinary science to compete, and thrashed every man in the field in the process. The race is billed as the world’s toughest endurance contest, and with good reason. It’s dark two-thirds of the time. Racers traverse the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and cross over Hadrian’s Wall to theCheviots, sleeping only in snatches. Yet Paris’s time of 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds beat her nearest male rival by nearly 15 hours. And she did it while expressing milk for her baby daughter in aid stations en route – ensuring more than her allotted 15 minutes of fame when she crossed the line. But it’s a fame she clearly finds a little baffling: it’s a fair bet no one has taken up fell running in a bid to become rich or famous. “That last day of the race, in the Cheviots, was so remote and so, so beautiful,” she tells me. Where we are in the Pentlands feels fairly remote on a windy day, but it is only a bus ride from Edinburgh town centre. “I think I saw one person in about 10 hours. It was one of those mountain days that you remember for ever. I had stopped thinking about the outside world. It’s a simple existence: you put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Emerging from the darkness to what came after – the whole world seemingly wanting to talk to you – was such a stark contrast. But that wasn’t the reason I wanted to do it. It was a challenge, a personal challenge.” The thing is, I think that might be why she won. When it comes to speed, men will always be first across the line. No woman will outsprint Usain Bolt. No woman will hit the side of the pool ahead of Michael Phelps’s world records. Yet a remarkable phenomenon seems to have gathered pace over the past few years: the longer and more brutal the event, the more women seem to be winning outright, or surpassing men’s achievements. In September this year, the US swimmer Sarah Thomas (already holder of the world record for the longest open-water swim) completed anotherbreathtaking feat of endurance. The Channel Swimming Association records 1,652 solo, observed, unassisted swims (no neoprene wetsuits or flotation devices) of the Channel since 1875. Thirty-four people have swum it there and back without stopping. Four people have swum it three times in a row (two men, two women). But only one – Thomas – has swum it four times. It took her 54 hours and 10 minutes, and though the crossing at its narrowest point is 20 miles, because of the strong tides pushing against her, she actually swam not 80 but close to 130 miles. This was despite battling nausea and throwing up everything she ate for the first two crossings. A day into her swim, she was almost ready to bail, but her team told her: just keep going. “So that’s what I did,” she said. “I swam until the sun came up and I started to feel better.” It’s not only Paris and Thomas. Last month Maggie Guteri became the first woman to win the peculiarly sadisticBig Dog Backyard Ultrain Tennessee. The distance is not even set – it’s a case of last man or woman standing. She ran for 60 hours and covered 250 miles. This year, German cyclist Fiona Kolbinger won theTranscontinentalrace – 2,485 miles across Europe. And in 2018, British fell runner Nicky Spinks set a record for the course in the Lake District known as theDouble Bob Graham Round(one circuit of 42 fells, 66 miles and 26,900ft of ascent isn’t enough). Most of these women aren’t even full-time athletes: Paris got up at 4am to fit her Spine Race training in. Spinks is a farmer. Kolbinger is a medical researcher. So what is going on here? Are we witnessing the beginning of a brave new world, or are these extraordinary women simply outliers? Those looking for a definitive scientific answer may be disappointed. Until about the age of 10, girls and boys are, athletically speaking, the same. Top running speed is the same for boys and girls, as is top swimming speed. Then puberty happens and testosterone changes everything. By 14, boys have bigger hearts, stronger arms, bigger shoulders, longer limbs, greater muscle mass. More power, and more speed, for life. In 2010, Israeli physicist Ira Hammerman set out to look at records in 82 different sports, ranging from running to speed skating, to see if there was a pattern to the resultant “performance gap”. In every sport, across every distance,a clear difference emerged: women’s speed records are about 9-11% slower than men’s. However, when it comes to very long endurance events, the data is limited. While ultrarunning is experiencing something of an explosion in popularity, there aren’t that many 200-mile-plus races, and relatively few women are running them. So is it not possible that after a certain mileage the relative advantages that male hormones bring just, well, run out? The renownedsports scientist Ross Tuckeris doubtful. He points out that the success rate among women in ultra-distance races is probably down to the fact that these are niche events – the tiny numbers of ultra-committed female athletes who do compete make any kind of analysis or extrapolation meaningless. However, intriguingly, he does wonder whether a woman’s body composition might prove to be an advantage when it comes to long-distance swimming. “The higher relative body fat percentage is probably enough to offset the differences in strength between men and women, particularly for cold water,” he says. A higher body fat percentage helps in buoyancy, which in turn reduces energy expenditure. It also helps insulate in cold water. Then there’s the theory that women do so well in ultra races because they are better than men at burning fat for fuel – making them more efficient. But if that were true, Tucker would expect the gap between the sexes to narrow as the reliance on fat gets larger – which doesn’t seem to be the case. “In running, from 100 metres to 90 kilometre ultramarathons, the gap between men and women doesn’t change,” he says. “That said, it could be that there is a kind of ‘inflection’ point where suddenly it begins to count. The data is just too thin to know for sure.” But if women win because of who else does or doesn’t turn up – how did Paris do so by such a margin? After all, when she won the Spine, the second-place finisher was Eoin Keith, a previous winner and the holder of the course record she smashed – hardly an average competitor. The answer may lie less in the body than in the head. Paris doesn’t run for prizes. She – like Thomas, who works for a healthcare company in Colorado – is an amateur, with a full-time job. If every single fell race in the country were called off tomorrow, she’d still be up in those hills every day. She tells me about holidays spent there in her late teens and early 20s with her brother. They’d pack everything they needed to be self-sufficient for a week, go to the remotest hills and hike, eat, sleep, repeat. She hasn’t raced a huge amount since January’s Spine Race, but in the summer she, her husband and a friend completed the Petite Trotte à Léon (PTL). Part of ultrarunning’s biggest event – the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) – the PTL is not so much a race as an endurance adventure. The 300km route passes through France, Italy and Switzerland, and includes 25,000m of ascent. “It was kind of a holiday,” Paris says, smiling. I suspect it’s not most people’s idea of a relaxing week. But it reminds me of a conversation I had with the cyclistEmily Chappell, who was the first woman across the line in the 2016 Transcontinental, and has herself been pondering the question of what can lead to women outperforming men. “I’ve got this bee in my bonnet about the current narrative for cycling – the male narrative,” she says. “A lot of it is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain and seeking out pain. Oh God, it’s so boring. So the working theory I’ve come up with is that people who do endurance sport are often people who have quite comfortable lives, and they are almost looking for pain elsewhere. I know it’s making generalisations, but what if men are looking for the pain they lack in life, and women are looking for the freedom?” It’s a persuasive theory. So many endurance events are marketed with a hefty dash of machismo – “tough” this, “ultimate” that, “warrior” the other. But is this constant reminder of suffering really the best way to approach an ultra event, when managing your head is as – if not more – important than managing your body? If you buy into this narrative that you are here only to suffer and endure, rather than have fun, then maybe those who start relaxed, looking forward to the journey, might have a head start. Perhaps this sounds a little woolly. But Thomas agrees that, for her, swimming is about freedom, not glory. “This is exactly me!” she says. “I don’t really care about racing and winning – I just like pushing myself. The long open-water swims make me feel free and strong. To look across the Channel and say, ‘I swam that’ is really empowering. I love being alone in a large body of water, knowing I’m relying on myself to make it through.” Dr Josephine Perry, a sports psychologist and author of Performing Under Pressure, goes a step further. She believes women are better at dealing with pain. “Eighty per cent of women get period pain at some point in their lives and around 10% have conditions like endometriosis, which can severely impact their ability to perform in sport,” she says. “If a large majority of women have developed strong coping mechanisms to deal with this regular pain, then the short-term pain they feel when running a race will fade in comparison.” Sports psychologists also often talk about “the process, not the outcome” – enjoying, or at least staying in, the moment. Thomas clearly embraces this. “I was always weird during my competitive swimming days. I loved the training more than the racing,” she says. Perry believes this mindset can, perhaps contrary to expectations, create winners. “Something I see regularly with athletes is that when you are expected to do well, it adds a significant pressure,” she explains. “When there are no expectations we relax and can enjoy the process of seeing what is possible, rather than worrying about failing. These women may well see the event as ‘just a race’ in which they can see what is possible, rather than openly and loudly setting out to win it. This can be incredibly beneficial to performance.” Then there is the question of pride. Even when women do not win outright, they often perform better than men: better, in that a higher proportion of women finish ultra events successfully. And ego – or rather a lack of one – may be a key factor. Paris tells me about another infamous ultra race she ran in 2015, theDragon’s Back: five days, 315km and 15,500m of ascent in the Welsh mountains. “One of my role models is Helene Diamantides, one of the pioneers of women’s fell running. She said to us at the start of the race: look around the room. If you are a man, you have a 50% chance of finishing the race. If you’re a woman, you have a 90% chance. But then, there were far fewer women in the room. Because they have less ego, they wouldn’t turn up unless they were well-prepared. Whereas men can be a bit like, how hard can this be?” Thomas agrees. “I think women do train harder, generally, and are less likely to wing something than the guys are,” she says. “I remember seeing something a few years ago that ran some numbers as related to speed. There are more guys who do longer swims, so there is a wider range of times, more variation. There are fewer women, but we seem to be more consistent.” It is backed up, too, by data from less extreme events. In marathon running, we know that women are on averagebetter pacers. Not faster overall, just better at running evenly: less likely to go out too hard and “blow up”. And whether it’s 26.2 miles or 262, going out too hard can be the worst mistake you can make. “In something like the Spine Race, it’s not even just about being able to run a long way,” Paris says. “It’s the fact that you need to look after yourself. You need to eat enough, feed yourself, look after your feet. I think sometimes the men, maybe their egos give them a single-mindedness and focus. But that’s almost a disadvantage, because actually, in an event that long you have to be able to multitask, to think about lots of things, to navigate [to look after yourself].” So having the biggest heart, and the highest oxygen uptake, might make you quickest over a certain distance but it won’t necessarily help you over days of endurance. Yet as Tucker suggests, if there is one sport in which women do narrow that performance gap it is ultra-endurance swimming. Over distances of 16-36km, women are generally only 1-6% slower. And in two long-distance swims, theCatalina Channel(32k) and theManhattan Island Marathon Swim(45.9km) – both of which Thomas has completed – the fastest women ever were faster than the best-performing men. As Tucker suggests, perhaps women’s body fat and its more even distribution is an advantage – fat is buoyant so aids flotation. But Thomas is not one to explore the theories. “I haven’t really looked into the science,” she says. “I just try to accept that my body is strong and can handle cold, no matter how much I hate my love handles.” Of course, women beating men is hardly new. In any race, some women will finish faster than some men – there’s even a phrase for it in the athlete’s lexicon: being “chicked”. It is not something all men take well. Even in my own career as a club runner, I’ve encountered a few who are clearly rankled by it, including a man who refused to let me run faster than him on a simple run commute home, to the point where he ended up throwing up under a tree because he’d pushed himself so hard. And I’ve also lost count of the number of races where the second half has been spent overtaking enthusiastic runners who set off too fast – 99% of them male. Fortunately, hostility is the exception. Thomas points out that swimming has a longer history of equality than most sports. “Gertrude Ederlewas the first woman to swim the Channel in the late 1920s, while the first female to run a marathon didn’t come along until the 70s. So women swimmers have a decades-longer tradition of being accepted than runners do. “I think most men are in awe of the women they swim with,” she adds. “They seem to accept that we’re just as tough, just as fast. That said, there are always exceptions. I have trained with men who think and act like they can beat me and get their feelings hurt when I pass them. I was sharing a lane with some guys a few years ago. When I was passing them, they tried to obstruct me. When I was getting out, two of them yelled at me for not being ‘respectful’ of their workout, never mind them being respectful of my workout. “And in 2008 or 2009, I outright won a 10k race. I passed the lead guy with about a mile to go and won by a couple of minutes. When we were done, I went up to congratulate him on a good race. He refused to shake my hand.” Paris has a similar story about a trail runner who wouldn’t let her pass him up a hill, despite clearly ruining his own race by speeding up too much. But she points out that generally fell running is democratic: “Here, you can have an elite runner and an 80-year-old in the same race, and we all have tea and cake together afterwards. There’s genuinely very little ego in this sport.” Where female winners often do encounter sexism, though, is in the reactions to their achievements. Thomas remarks that she’s constantly asked if she has kids, “with the assumption that if I did, I wouldn’t be doing what I was doing”. Paris says that she avoided looking too much at the comments under the articles about her victory. We also talk aboutEmelie Forsberg, a star of the ultrarunning world, with multiple wins to her name. Recently she had a baby with her partner,Kilian Jornet– himself probably the closest thing ultrarunning has to a household name. Forsberg was posting onInstagramabout her return to competition in the Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC; part of the UTMB race series), which would take her about 12 hours. Paris says she immediately spotted one reply asking: “When you run for 12 hours, who looks after your baby? Don’t you worry about her?” “She replied with four words: ‘She has a father,’” Paris says. “And I thought yes, that absolutely sums it up. It’s crazy.” And so, despite these amazing athletes conquering distances most of us would consider an effort in a car, there’s still a considerable way to go. But make no mistake, times are changing in the endurance game. And these women know better than most how to stay in it for the long haul.

Runner’s high: the well-trodden road of swapping drugs and alcohol for exercise,"From marathon binges to marathon running, here’s why former substance users find release in hitting the pavement Even in his cocaine-bingeing years, which culminated in his car being shot at by drug dealers, Charlie Engle was the top salesman at the fitness club he worked at. You might call him a high achiever. NowEngle is an ultramarathon runnerin some of the world’s most inhospitable environments, and author of the memoir The Running Man. He tells Guardian Australia that, for him, part of the attraction is the pursuit of novelty. “In my view, drug taking is very much about chasing firsts,” he says. “The absolute best I ever felt in relation to drugs was actually the acquisition of the drug. There’s nothing more powerful than having the drugs in my pocket; the idea of what it can be. “And, in a way, running is the same because there’s this weird idea that you’re going to enter a 100-miler and this time it’s going to be different. This time it’s not gonna hurt so much, and everything’s going to be perfect.” Swapping substances for running – over any other sport – is common. The addiction and recovery websitethe Fix regularly publishes running articles, and memoirs about this lifestyle swap include Catra Corbett’s Reborn on the Run, Caleb Daniloff’s Running Ransom Road and Catriona Menzies-Pike’s The Long Run. In the case Menzies-Pike, the former “gin-addled bookworm” used to eye runners with suspicion as she nursed her lattes and hangovers. She’d spent a decade adrift after the sudden death of her parents before it struck her that she’d been preoccupied with distance and endurance and running away, so perhaps the logical answer was actual running. Now the Sydney-based editor has run five marathons.“I was not at a great point in my life,” she tells Guardian Australia. “I really hadn’t dealt with the death of my mum and dad at all, but when I started running there was this quick conversion, and then a whole lot of other things started to fall more into an orderly shape. I started to sleep better and eat better, and I started getting trashed less. There was structure that came into my life.” It’s an outcome echoed in new film Brittany Runs a Marathon, released in Australia on 31 October. Its title character – a heavy drinker who is overweight and has low self-esteem – hasn’t processed the death of her father. She goes to the doctor hoping for a quick fix of Adderall but is instead prescribed exercise. Brittany decides to aim for the New York City Marathon and her training helps her get her life on track. Menzies-Pike says: “Running gave me a space to deal with the fact that I fucked up the grieving process. I found tremendous emotional variety in that space, and I would have these periods of total relaxation as I looked at a beautiful Sydney waterside view, and then other periods of experiencing physical resistance. Then there were periods of total emotional turmoil, where all of these suppressed feelings would rise up and I’d be running against them.” When a person gives up one dopaminergic behaviour, such as taking substances, they’re likely to experience cross-addiction and chase the same sense of stimulation in something else. But why long-distance running in particular? Both behaviours require a capacity for endurance, provide a sense of release, can instil the intoxicating feeling of being an outlier, and can be solitary pursuits. The Sydney-based journalist Paul Maley is a trail runner who knocked his heavy drinking on its head four years ago to focus on his more active pursuit. He has now ticked off ultramarathons including the Blackall 100 and the 250km Big Red Run. “It became increasingly difficult [to run] as my drinking got heavier, to the point where a choice was required,” he says. “And I chose running. You don’t have to be Sigmund Freud to see the relationship there. In both cases you’re chasing that dopamine or endorphin rush.” Running produces boosts in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the first instance, with the more hard-earned “runner’s high” of endorphins and –some researchers think– an endocannabinoid called anandamide coming later. A person might reasonably expect that, when they give up substances their behaviour becomes less self-centred but, as Maley points, out: “You need to find other ways of coping with stress and managing your emotions. After I stopped drinking I was much more self-absorbed and spent much more time in my own head – no one tells you how self-absorbing the process is. Running was really good for stilling my mind because it’s quite meditative.” By her own admission, Menzies-Pike used to view runners with suspicion and, as Engle notes, extreme training can elicit more comments of concern from people than getting wasted ever did. “People regularly ask me, ‘Do you think that’s healthy?’” he says, laughing. “I’m going to sound very judgmental, but I think people who criticise very likely feel badly about themselves. In my experience, it’s rarely based in true concern. Because if they’re around me enough, they’re going to see how running makes me happy.” It can be true that those with an all-or-nothing mindset may wind up overdoing it. That was the case for Lisa Bench, a Newcastle-based administrative assistant. “I literally ran myself into the ground,” she says. “Exactly the same as with the booze.” When she stopped drinking, Bench was drawn to the sugar she was missing in alcohol. To counteract her unhealthy diet, she decided she needed to exercise excessively. “I started on the treadmill but I didn’t want to be known as that chick at the gym on the treadmill for 90 minutes, Monday to Sunday,” she says, “because then you’ve got a problem.” So she started pounding the pavement where people might not notice; first 5km, then nine, right up to 24 – all before getting to the office by 8.30am, buzzing. Tracking her progress with apps made her more obsessive. “I’d think, ‘Maybe I could not put makeup on today. Maybe I could get away with not washing my hair so that I can get more of the run in. I’ve got an eating disorder as well, because that’s closely linked with alcoholism, and I was running on practically nothing.” She became thin and exhausted with an unshakeable headache, so she finally took heed of her husband’s pleading and took a day off. She went to see an acupuncturist and stopped running altogether. But she feels restless. “I get bored so quickly,” she says. “It’s all about escaping reality for me.” Engle says: “I see tons of addiction in the running community that doesn’t necessarily manifest in drugs but in other behaviours. There is something that’s not fulfilled. It’s not a negative, it’s just a space that needs to be filled with something other than normal living – because I personally don’t have any interest in being in that safe middle ground.”"
53C heat and melted shoes: is the 135-mile Badwater the world's toughest race?,"Welcome to the Badwater Ultramarathon: a 135-mile non-stop race over three mountain ranges in sweltering mid-summer desert heat with a vertical ascent of 13,000 feet At 9.30pm on 23 July 2018, the second wave of runners lined up at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, 280 feet below sea level. The heat from the day had not cooled and the temperature was 118F (48C), even though the sun had long since gone down. To make matters worse, it was abnormally humid for the California desert. Sixty-two-year-old Pamela Chapman-Markle looked down the line of racers, recognizing about half the competitors from previous years. On a normal day she would be heading to bed in a half hour, and although her heart was racing with anticipation, she was already tired, acutely aware that she was about to miss two nights of sleep. The starting gun fired and the runners set off on an incline. There would be 14,600ft of cumulative elevation for the runners to climb over the course of the 135-mile race ahead. Chapman-Markle tried to calm her emotions and steady her heart rate. Five miles in, her throat was already sore from the still drier air, a drastic shift from the 90% humidity she trained in. With no light pollution, she could see the stars clearly, but at 62, her vision at night wasn’t as good as it used to be, so she relied on a waist belt to light her path. For the first 20 miles, she passed runners, while others passed by her. Soon though, she wouldn’t see anyone for long stretches. Chapman-Markle would have to run the first 42 miles by herself before her crew could pace her just before daybreak. And even then, her pacers would follow behind her single file and switch off every five miles, returning to the cool air conditioning of the car Chapman-Markle’s husband drove up ahead. Chapman-Markle would have to do with ice. Ice she put down her sports bra, ice she chewed, ice water she drank as she tried to contend with the overwhelming heat. Last year, Chapman-Markle finished the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon in 34hr 30min, setting a record in the women’s 60-plus age group for a third year in a row. Now 63, Chapman-Markle is the oldest female competitor in the race with designs on beating her record yet again. She is one of 95 competitors from 21 countries and 30 states accepted to run the ultramarathon this year. The 135-mile race, which takes place this year from 15-17 July starting in Death Valley and and ending at Whitney Portal, 8,300ft above sea level, is often referred to as “the world’s toughest footrace”. Badwater 135 is considered by many ultrarunners to be the crown jewel of ultramarathons, which are defined as anything longer than a marathon. Temperatures climbed as high as 127F (53C) last year, and the asphalt road can get even hotter, causing the road to burn to runners’ feet. Chapman-Markle had the soles on three pairs of shoes melt last year. The race traverses three valleys and three mountain ranges, and after 122 grueling miles, runners face a steep final ascent to Whitney Portal at an elevation of 8360ft. “Risk of very, very serious medical issues in a race like Badwater is high,” Shawn Bearden, a professor of physiology at Idaho State University and ultrarunner himself, said. “We’re not built to go 50 miles, 100 miles, or Badwater 135 miles. “But we are capable of it.” The biggest challenge running Badwater is the heat. Bearden, who has crewed and paced for the Badwater race once and studied the physiology of ultrarunning, notes that the reason competitors are able to complete it is the human ability to thermoregulate and cool down by sweating. But Badwater puts a massive strain on one’s thermoregulation and therefore on one’s gastrointestinal system. “The only way you’re going to survive Badwater is by consuming enough fluids and getting fluids and nutrients back in,” Bearden explained. “That means we’ve got to be able to sweat a lot and send blood to our skin to cool off, while sending blood to our muscles to keep us moving, while sending blood to our gut to absorb water and nutrients. So there’s a massive strain on all of those tissues and systems.” And if a runner attempted to just drink water and not eat? “You have a good chance of dying by the end from a condition called hyponatremia,” Bearden said, “where you effectively dilute the salts in your blood because you’re losing some of your sweat and you’re only replacing water.” That’s not to mention the muscle breakdown, which Bearden describes on a molecular level looking “like a blender went through it,” and takes months to repair, even if a runner feels good enough to run a week later. ***** Matt Collins had just left the 100-kilometer mark at Forest Park in Queens and his pacer, a cross country buddy from college, along with it. His feet padded the ground in the fresh shoes that he had changed into at the stop, where he had taped the blisters on the outside of his big and pinkie toes, and for a moment, his calloused and reddened feet were dry. He attempted to get down some pizza as he walked and readied himself for running another marathon and a half. With each stride, his hamstrings and quads screamed. His legs had been cramping for miles, and he knew the pain wouldn’t go away. It’s not going to get any worse, he told himself. Collins had been looking to the 100-kilometer marker since the beginning of the Great New York 100-miler, as he cut through Central Park heading North, ran along the Hudson and through the Bronx, and crossed the bridge into Queens with his pacer, where they laughed at Collins’ poor form reflected in store windows – his heel strike too hard, hitting the pavement like a heavy man. They sang country songs as they ran along the water in Queens and passed picnics and soccer games. When they reached the Unisphere fountains at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, the two jumped in and let the water fall down on them. Now that the 62 miles were behind him, as well as the highs of the last 15, Collins was exhausted, daunted by the 38 miles ahead he had to face alone. He picked up his legs. Collins also had Badwater, a mere three weeks away, on his mind. At 28, he would be the youngest competitor in the race, and the 100-miler he was currently running was in part in preparation for Badwater. Could he keep his hydration at a high enough level? He would need it for Badwater’s heat. Aware of his tendency to go out too strong, he had begun today’s race at a moderate pace. At Alley Pond Park in Queens, around 51 miles into the race, he took down four Dixie cups of pickle juice, savoring the salty brine of electrolytes and greedy for more. Collins had been behind on training. “Intramural hockey games probably don’t get you ready for the hardest race in the world,” Collins said, laughing at his attempts to stay fit as he finished up his MBA at Wharton Business School in Philadelphia. At times, he would come home from a night out with classmates and head out on a run at 5am. “Maybe because we’re a little younger, we definitely have more of a cowboy attitude,” Collins said about running ultramarathons with his pacer for Badwater, another college cross country buddy. But Badwater is the first race he’s pored over online resources for information on how to run the course, even sparing a few minutes during the Great New York 100-miler to talk to the race director, who ran Badwater, for tips. Since then, he has run two to three 20-mile runs a week in his parents’ basement, with the space heaters cranked up until he blew a fuse and had to rearrange the outlets. On the other days of the week, he runs up to six miles, and will sit in the sauna set at 160F for as long he can handle. “The heat impacts everything else,” he said. “If you’re not keeping cool, keeping smart, then you fall behind on electrolytes, which means your body can’t take in food, which means you can’t really move forward, and you’re cramping.” Collins’ training is in sharp contrast with Chapman-Markle. After her first ultramarathon (or marathon for that matter), a 100-miler through the woods in Texas aged 55 that left her hypothermic, dangerously dehydrated, and with a stress fracture in right tibia, her grown children drove her to the hospital, where she had IV fluids hooked up to her arm. “No more, Mom,” they told her. “Try something else.” Chapman-Markle instead decided to do more research on how to properly train for an ultramarathon. Forty-five ultramarathons later, six this year alone, and after two years focusing on proper form, Chapman-Markle has a strenuous, consistent training schedule and strict recovery routine. She has not only remained healthy, but has been breaking USA Track & Field records for her age group and is pursuing the world records now. Based in Galveston, Texas, Chapman-Markle runs in 38C weather with 90% humidity regularly, hitting the roads around 2 or 3pm on the weekdays while the sun is still high in the sky when she gets home from her job as a nurse anesthetist. Every other weekend, Chapman-Markle and her husband, who has crewed her since her second race, head to her condo 30 minutes north of Austin in the hills. There he will hop on a bike as she runs the hills for two to four hours. “The closer I get to Badwater, the more mileage I’ll add on, so sometimes, I do two-a-day trains, I might go out for two and a half hours in the morning and an hour and a half at night.” To prep for the 13-mile hike at the end of Badwater, she’ll put on a 10-pound weighted vest and hike her running route. “I think you can walk it faster than you can run it, because it’s an 8% to 10% grade,” she said of the final push. And on the recovery side of her preparation, Chapman-Markle is just as thorough: She sits in the sauna built into her house every night for 30 to 40 minutes to help her heat train before heading to bed for seven to eight hours. ***** Consistency is key to ultrarunning and completing Badwater 135, Shawn Bearden said. “Consistency is several fold,” he notes, pointing to consistency in one’s day-to-day training and being consistent in one’s training over years, and keeping one’s diet – whether high-carb, high-fat, or otherwise – consistent. “It takes years for people to build up really to being able to comfortably handle these very long distances.” This is also one reason runners in Badwater are, on average, older. The average age for Badwater 135 participants is 47 years old, with the oldest at 72. There are a few other reasons Bearden points to: as we age, we develop more of slow-twitch muscles that help on long runs. Psychological maturity comes with age. “Older people have a better understanding that the sun will come up tomorrow,” Bearden said. And it takes years for people to develop what he calls “craft”: the skills of ultrarunning and understanding the limits and needs of one’s body. For 51-year-old Filipino Tess Bibal Leono, the biggest challenge to her training is the stray dogs. An analyst for the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines, Leono’s work brings her to islands throughout the Pacific, where many hotels don’t have gyms and she will have to run on the road. Packs of stray dogs will begin to follow her and chase her if she continues running. “If I see a dog, I try to stop running. So it kind of limits your training,” she said. Leono ran the Badwater 135 in 2016 and 2018, quitting in 2018 after 80 miles due to acid reflux. Too excited for the race, she hadn’t slept the night before, and with record heat and unusual humidity, the event had thelowest completion ratein its 41-year history, with many of those disqualified by the time limit or quitting the race having finished the race in previous years. “I didn’t prepare,” Leono said. “I thought I prepared well.” Her training for the 2018 Badwater had been disrupted at times by her busy travel schedule. This year, she made a commitment to get in at least 30 minutes a day if traveling, and she will often get back to the hotel after work and nap, waking at 9pm or 12am to get a run in the hotel’s gym even if it’s just five kilometers. She has been running marathons on the weekends and tack on an extra 10 kilometers as the rest of the marathoners head home. The final hurdle for competitors is the psychological aspect. “I really think that most people who are capable of running a full marathon really could step up and run 100 miles,” Bearden said. “It’s all about your mindset and how you can handle every cell your body screaming and telling you, this is stupid. You should stop.” “That’s part of being an ultrarunner, you always get extremely depressed because you’re sleep-deprived, and fluids and sodium aren’t proper, and your brain will want you to stop, to quit, or [ask] why are you doing this? I know why I’m doing this,” Chapman-Markle said. “The one thing I do have is mental strength. And I think that’s probably 65% of running a race like this.” Chapman-Markle tries to stay positive and think nothing but grateful thoughts. “If bad thoughts do come in, I think my body needs something so I just try to figure out what it needs, give it to it, and get back to my happy thoughts,” she said. “It’s obviously very physically hard. Mentally it is probably harder,” Collins said. He recalled his first ultramarathon, a 50-miler he participated in to raise money for Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where his brother was battling leukemia. “For me, I had a reason to be out there so that eliminated a lot of the temptation of dropping out and seeing there’s an escape valve. For me, there was just the finish line,” he said. ***** For Collins, the 100-mile Great New YorkRunningExposition didn’t prompt the usual roller coaster of emotion he normally experiences during an ultramarathon. Collins finished first, crossing the finish line at 16hr 11min, jubilant to sit down and cheer on his friend who had closed in on his lead and finished first for the women. “I felt really excited for what we’re going to do in three weeks [at Badwater],” he said. “It was exactly the test I wanted it to be.” Collins was clear that the race was an exception. “It was the first one ever I haven’t cried,” he said. He had run the Great New York 100-miler before, the terrain was relatively flat, and the weather, at 80F, mild. Badwater would be another beast. But Collins has learned a lot since his first ultramarathon at 24 and about what his body can handle. He tried to drive home by himself from that first 50-miler and, in sheer exhaustion, put the car into an embankment. This time, he booked himself a hotel in Times Square where the race ended, so he wouldn’t have to walk too far. “You just go to such insane lows, and that bring you to such amazing highs,” Collins said. “I’m not usually good at race specific training, which this race is a bit of an aberration from that.” Before heading off to the desert this weekend, Collins flew to Puerto Rico for the Fourth of July weekend, taking the week before Badwater off from any strenuous runs. When asked what he’d do with his week off, he said with a smile: “Probably nothing productive.”"
Briton mails severed toes to Canada for use in notorious cocktail,"Nick Griffiths sent two digits lost to frostbite to Yukon hotel renowned for Sourtoe special The amputated toes of a British endurance athlete are to be given new life, as the centrepiece of a notorious Canadian cocktail. As Nick Griffiths lay in a hospital bed last year aftersuccumbing to frostbitein the Yukon Arctic race in northwest Canada,the world’s coldest ultra-marathon,his mind drifted to an advertisement he had seen earlier in a hotel in the territory. “It said: ‘Had frostbite? We want your toes,’” Griffiths told the Guardian. “I thought it was a bit of a joke, really.” It was not. For more than 40 years, visitors have flocked to the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City for a chance to try the country’s most infamous drink: the Sourtoe Cocktail. The beverage consists of a mummified human toe floating in a whiskey shot; patrons must let the digit – or its blackened nail – touch their lips in order to receive a certificate and qualify for admittance to the Sourtoe Cocktail Club. Upon returning home to Bolton, Griffiths learned he would lose three of his toes to the frostbite. He asked the surgeon to keep them. During his recovery, he began corresponding with the Downtown Hotel about possibly donating the digits, but his physical rehabilitation and work hours complicated plans to travel to Yukon. Months passed and Griffiths kept his toes in jars “just in my bedside drawer”. Finally, after much back and forth with the hotel, he suggested simply mailing them toCanada. At the post office, he panicked after being asked what was in the polythene envelope. “I couldn’t think of anything. I didn’t want to just blatantly lie and say it was a candle or whatever.” He told the postal clerk he was mailing his toes – and wrote “Novelty gift” on the envelope. He kept one of the toes as “insurance” because, he said: “I’m not sure really you should be posting toes.” More than a month later, the toes arrived in Dawson City. “We couldn’t be happier to receive a new toe. They are very hard to come by these days,” said the hotel in a statement. Terry Lee, the hotel’s “toe expert” will now preserve the digits in rock salt for at least six weeks before they are served in whiskey. “The big toe is the money toe,” Lee told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “We usually don’t get frostbitten toes. Usually, they’re from gout or diabetes, or they’re lawnmowers or chainsaws or accidents … to get a frostbitten toe, that’s phenomenal.” There are currently three toes in use. In recent years, the hotel has grappled witha spate of toe thefts, and the hotel now nails anyone who attempts to swipe a toe with a fine of C$2,500 (£1,500). The establishment is now trying to convince Griffiths to make the trip to the Yukon to try the cocktail. He is not sure if anyone has ever sipped the whiskey with their own toe swirling around, but is keen to be the first. “People look at you as though you’re a bit mad, he said. “But I think it’s a nice little bit of fun.”"
How the sheer hell of ultrarunning led me to a strange peace,"He was often on the verge of giving up such gruelling challenges, but eventually Adharanand Finn found that ultrarunning led him to a meditative state Inever wanted to run an ultra marathon. I’ve always loved running, the freedom of it, the childish abandon, but I was a 10K and half-marathon runner, a “real” runner (in my eyes), someone who pushed the pace and gunned for fast times.Ultrarunning, with all its backpacks, poles and food, was not really running. It was running with all the joy bludgeoned out of it. So when a magazine editor asked me to run the 165kmOman Desert Marathonto write an article about it, I said no: 100 miles across sand, in the heat of Oman. It sounded like hell. But as the days went by, and I thought about it again, I began to wonder why people did these races. Ultra races are anything longer than a marathon, starting at about 30 miles, and going all the way up to the world’s longest race, a 3,100-mile jaunt around a single city block in New York. Despite the almost incomprehensible distances, the sport of ultrarunning has been growing at an incredible rate, with around a 1,000% increase in participants globally in the past 10 years. What was going on? Why were people doing it? Was it simply to impress their friends – a symptom of our show-off, selfie-obsessed modern culture? I found that even just talking about doing one had people shaking their heads in wonder. The pictures of me slogging across the desert would certainly be a hit on Instagram. But surely there was more to it than that… The more I thought about it, the more I began to see it not as a running race, but as an adventure. To traverse the desert on foot for five days, carrying everything I needed on my back, running at night under the stars, would surely be an amazing life experience. And who knew what I might discover about myself along the way? So I got back to the editor and said yes. “I know it’s a bit bonkers,” he said. “Only do the first day if you want.” But no, I now wanted the full experience. The idea had gripped me and was slowly dragging me in. I wanted to know what it was like to take on such a challenge and make it out the other side. In the end, my experience in the Oman desert ebbed and flowed. At times I felt strong, powerful, racing like a supercharged hero across the sand. At other times I was a wreck, whimpering and on the verge of giving up. But somehow I made it to the end, to the finish on the beach, where I ran straight into the sea and, bobbing in the waves, swore I’d never do anything so stupid again. But it wouldn’tleave me alone, this urge to push myself further, to test myself, and to come through to the other side. I started entering more and more ultra marathons. I ran 100 miles through the Pyrenees, hallucinating about cocktail parties on the side of a mountain midway through a second consecutive night without sleep. I ran for 24 hours around a running track in south London. In the end I ran 10 ultra marathons in two years. The training wasn’t too extreme. Occasionally, I would get up at 4am and head to the coast path near my home in Devon and run for four hours. But mostly the training wasn’t much more exhausting or time-consuming than before, when I was a “serious” road runner. The races themselves were when the big effort happened. My runs became longer, but slower and, in that sense, more enjoyable. I went off-road and took in the scenery. I brought snacks and sat down to eat them. The speed was no longer important. At first, what motivated me, and kept me moving in races, was the outcome. I wanted to reach the finish line and to bask in all the relief and the warm satisfaction that came with conquering these races. The process, however, kept breaking me. In every single race, I reached a moment of crisis, where I sat down on the side of the trail and wanted to give up, where I asked myself why I was in this stupid race. The answer was always elusive and I came close to quitting many times. I noticed that the people who did well in these races were often those with a calm, steely focus; people who seemed to be able to maintain an even emotional state throughout. I, on the other hand, more emotional than I had realised, was as up and down and as out of control as a child on a bouncy castle. I would get surges of energy where I felt I could win the entire race, skipping down mountain sides like a character in a CGI movie. And then, bam, I’d crash and tumble into dejection, anger, frustration. I would get mad at the race organisers for sending me up such steep hills. I would get mad at the hills themselves. Seasoned ultrarunners call these moments of crisis – when you’re struggling to find the will to go on – the pain cave. And they talk about how they relish going there, how they love digging in the pain cave. But whenever I got even a few steps inside, all I could think was: “They’re all mad.” The pain cave was horrible, it ate you up, it tore you apart. Why would anyone want to experience this level of tiredness, this aching of every limb, seasoned with the thought you still had 50 miles to go? Actually, it was often this thought that was the worst thing. The moment you looked at your watch and started to calculate how far you still had to go, the distance was usually so overwhelming that just the thought of it hit you like a punch to the stomach. Ultrarunners repeatedly told me that the key was to stay in the moment, to run the mile you’re in and forget about the rest. That sounded easy, but it wasn’t. I read about a US runner who had lost some short-term memory function in an operation to cure her of epilepsy. As a result, when she ran, she never knew how far through a race she was, or how far she had to go. So she had no choice but to exist in the moment and just keep moving. It caused her no end of difficulties in her day-to-day life, but it made her a formidable ultrarunner. But how could I emulate her powers in my own ultrarunning? One trick was to ditch my watch, which helped a little. But I still longed for the outcome. One runner told me his big problem was that he always thought about the finish too early. At first, I didn’t see why that was a problem. Surely that sweet feeling of conquering the race, of making it to the end, was a positive driving force. But the thought could break you, because the end was usually so far away, and because just thinking about it took you out of the present moment. As the Japanese marathon monks ofMount Hieionce told me about their challenge to complete 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days, it was a meditation in movement. Ultrarunning, done well, was all about the process, not the outcome. And, like a meditation, that meant staying in the moment. Eventually, I realised the secret was to embrace the struggle, as they’d told me all along. To stand in the midst of the storm, facing the oblivion, and to say to yourself: this is why I’m here. This is what I came for. A friend who ran two of my 100-mile races with me said an ultra marathon doesn’t begin until 50 miles in. “At the start,” she said, “I have too much energy, but when I get tired, everything melts away and it’s just me and the running.” Yes, in the oblivion, deep in the pain cave, if we dig deep enough, if we push on through, we come to a place where it is strangely peaceful, where everything else melts away, even, amazingly, the pain in our legs, the tiredness that had seemed so debilitating, it all clears. And there, out in the mountains, or even on a city running track, we find ourselves fully present in the moment. It’s rare, in our modern lives, to come this close to our stripped-back, primal selves. In the end, I found that in depths of an ultra marathon lies a stillness, an awareness of existence, that makes it all worthwhile. It was strange, but despite initially longing for that feeling of arriving at the finish as the all-conquering hero, glowing with the satisfaction of achieving my goal, in reality the end, when it came, was often an anti-climax. I know it sounds a bit bonkers, but sometimes, despite all my struggles, I’d get to a point after 100 miles of running, where I didn’t even want to stop.

British woman one of last to quit 'toughest ultra-marathon',"Nicky Spinks, 51, pulled out of 100-mile Barkley race in US, which no one finished this year A British runner was one of the last women to drop out in this year’s Barkley Marathons, a gruelling race that has been completed by just 15 people in its history and has ascents equivalent to climbing Everest twice. Nicky Spinks, 51, a beef farmer and breast cancer survivor from West Yorkshire, ran alongside a Canadian, Stephanie Case, in an attempt at the 100-mile mountain event widely regarded as the world’s toughest ultra-marathon. For a second successive year, none of the 40 selected starters finished. Spinks and Case completed the first 20-mile lap together and dropped out partway through lap two in appalling weather conditions. Five male runners completed three laps. Staged in Frozen Head state park, Tennessee, the race comprises five laps, each with about 10,000 feet of steep, muddy ascent through thick woodland. There is a 60-hour time limit. Runners navigate their way around an unmarked course, tearing pages from hidden books as they go and returning them to the event’s enigmatic organiser, Gary “Lazarus Lake” Cantrell. The race was first held in 1986 and was made famous by a 2014 Netflix documentary. Spinks, from Huddersfield, is no stranger to difficult races. Last year she became thefirst person to complete a double Ramsay Roundin the Highlands, running 116 miles with 57,000ft of ascent and twice summiting 24 mountains (23 of them Munros) in 55 hours and 56 minutes. She also won the women’s race in September’s Ultra Tour Monte Rosa in Switzerland. Recovering in the US, Spinks said: “The Barkley Marathons was extremely tough in many ways. The first lap was run in really hot conditions, too hot for my liking, and then the second lap was the opposite, unbelievably cold with lots of rain. “I ran with Stephanie, who is a Barkley veteran, and she was brilliant in helping me learn about the unique elements of the race. Lap one took us about 11 and a half hours, which was longer than I had hoped, but the temperatures, the difficult terrain and the time spent trying to find the well-hidden books all played a part.” After a quick turnaround with their support crews, Spinks and Case set off on the second lap in the dark with fellow runners Michiel Panhuysen and Billy Reed, but the weather forced them back to camp in the early hours. “The weather forecast didn’t really detail just how cold it was going to be in the mountains and none of us had extreme winter kit in our race packs. It turned out to be incredibly cold and wet, which, together with the darkness and fog, made for slow going,” Spinks said. “When we realised we had no chance of completing lap two inside the time limit, we took an escape route. I’m not one to give up on anything, but I’m glad we made the decision we did. It was the right decision. Even coming back down the valley, away from the higher ground, we were still struggling with the cold. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that cold.” The race was inspired by a nearby prison break by James Earl Ray, Martin Luther King’s assassin, in 1977, and it is shrouded in secrecy, with the route changed each year. Spinks said: “We returned to camp in the early hours, though I’m not sure when exactly as the watches Laz [Cantrell] made us all wear didn’t tell the proper time. “I think that to complete the full five laps is, well … I can see now why only 15 people have done that in 33 years. Laz makes the race harder and harder, changes the course so even the Barkley veterans don’t know where the books are, and this year I think he added in even more uphill climbs. That’s all part of what makes Barkley Marathons the race it is.”"
Record-breaking ultrarunner Jasmin Paris breaks into British team,"Jasmin Paris,the ultrarunner who became a global sensationearlier this month when she won the 268-mile Spine Race, beating her male rivals by 15 hours and the course record by over 12, has been rewarded by selection to run for Britain for the first time at the age of 35. Paris, who also holds three separate UK 24-hour mountain running records while holding down a job as a full-time vet, is named in a British team of 12 for June’s Trail World Championships in Miranda do Corvo in Portugal. This follows her victory in one of the world’s toughest races, along the Pennine Way from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish borders in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. Britain’s squad also includes the world long-distance mountain running champion, Charlotte Morgan, as well as the men’s ultra skyrunning world champion, Jon Albon. The 2013 world ultra-trial champion, Ricky Lightfoot, and Andrew Davies, who ran for England in last year’s Commonwealth Games, also get the nod. The British team leader, Adrian Stott, hailed his strong squad and predicted that it would challenge for the podium: “The strength in depth of mountain and trail running in the UK just now is apparent in the strong men’s and women’s teams selected. The British team has traditionally competed well and come home with team medals from these championships. We are sure our team will again be a match to challenge the leading nations like Spain, Italy, France and the USA. “The fact it is a relatively short but technical 45km course for this year’s ultra-trail championship has been reflected in the selection with a mix of experienced ultra-runners and long-distance fell runners, well suited to doing well in June.” Senior Women:Katie Kaars Sijpesteijn, Jo Meek, Charlotte Morgan Holly Page, Jasmin Paris, Georgia Tindley.Senior Men:Jon Albon, Seb Batchelor, Carl Bell, Andrew Davies, Ricky Lightfoot, Andy Symonds."
Ultrarunner Jasmin Paris on her gruelling 83-hour win: ‘I just had one job to do',"The winner of the brutal Montane Spine Race on how hiking with her baby helped her to smash the men’s record – despite having to express milk along the way It is Britain’s most brutal running race – 268 miles non-stop along the Pennine Way, from Edale in Derbyshire to the Scottish Borders, in January.Jasmin Paris, who is still breastfeeding her 14-month-old daughter Rowan, and was expressing milk along the way, this week beat 136 other competitors – including 125 men – from 15 different countries, to win theMontane Spine Raceoutright. In the process, on Wednesday, she smashed the men’s course record by more than 12 hours. Paris, who is a vet working at the University of Edinburgh and studying acute myeloid leukaemia, told the Guardian she had planned to wean her daughter before the race began, but two back-to-back viral infections meant baby Rowan refused to take anything except milk for five days, and so by the time of the race she was still breastfeeding to avoid mastitis. “I had to express during the race so it didn’t get uncomfortable,” she says. “At the first checkpoint, it slowed me down a lot and I had to hurry afterwards to catch back up.” As the race progressed she produced less milk, so the expressing became quicker. “In the end,” she says, “it was less of a problem than I’d feared.” To fit her training for the Spine Race in around her job and family life, Paris had to get up at 4am each day, when she would head out for runs in the hills around her home near Edinburgh, while her family were still in bed. She also went on plenty of long hikes with her baby. “My coach told me to get a weight vest to practice running with a backpack,” she says. “But I thought, I have a baby, I’ll take her. It was decent training.” In all, she was out on the course for 83 hours and 12 minutes, pausing to power nap, eat and express milk for a total of only seven hours along the way. She had to carry everything she needed, and had to navigate using a map and compass, mostly alone and in the dark. But she was relentless. Previous winnerEugeni Roselló Soléfrom Spain pushed himself so hard chasing her in second place that he was forced to pull out of the race exhausted with four miles to go. Almost 20 hours after she had finished, only two men had completed the race, with everyone else either still out on the course or retired. Paris says the hardest part was the first 24 hours. “It’s weird, but I missed my family most then, and I still had so far to go.” She says by the end she was completely absorbed in the race, trying to stay ahead of her rivals, and the thought of seeing her daughter again was spurring her on. She has alsospoken of hallucinationsbecause of lack of sleep. “On the final section, I kept seeing animals appearing out of every rock,” she says. “And I kept forgetting what I was doing out there.” Top British ultra runner and formerSpine Race finisher Damian Hallsays: “Her performance was extraordinary – one of the great British ultra-running performances. “What’s especially impressive is that it’s her first time doing a race like this – and she was racing against some previous winners. She showed incredible determination and focus. It’s unusual for someone to do so well when they’re new to this type of racing, which is seriously tiring.” Olympian Jo Paveysays Paris’s performance was “awesome and inspiring … It must have been amazing for her to cross the finish line and have her little one there for a hug.” What was that like? Paris laughs. “My daughter’s really sociable,” she says. “So she had made friends with all the officials and people at the finish. When she saw me, she wasn’t really that bothered.” Since finishing, Paris has been caught up in a whirlwind of attention, with television appearances andChelsea Clinton tweeting about her victory. “In a way, this bit has been harder than the race,” she says. “At least then I just had one job to do: keep putting one foot in front of the other.” All she craves now is a good night’s sleep. “And then I have a thesis to write,” she says."
Jasmin Paris becomes first woman to win 268-mile Montane Spine Race,"Shattered record while beating all male and female rivalsRunner expressed breast milk for her baby at aid stations The British ultrarunner Jasmin Paris is celebrating after becoming the first woman to win the gruelling 268-mile Montane Spine Race along the Pennine Way. What made the performance even more extraordinary was that she shattered the course record by 12 hours – while also expressing breast milk for her baby at aid stations along the route. Paris, a 35-year-old vet who works at the University of Edinburgh studying acute myeloid leukaemia, is well known in British endurance running circles having won the British women’s fell running championships last year as well as a series of leading ultraraces. However, her performance at the Montane Spine race was undoubtedly the best in her career as she beat all her male and female rivals in completing the course from the Edale in the Peak District to the Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish borders in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. That time shattered the previous best of 95hrs 17mins set by Eoin Keith in 2016 as Paris became the first woman to win the race outright. The previous female race record was 109hr 54min set by Carol Morgan in 2017. After the race, in which runners carry their own kit throughout and rest only when essential, Paris admitted to having hallucinations in the later stages. “It is really tough,” said Paris after running along the full Pennine Way through the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and over Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland to the Cheviots. “Two thirds of the time it is dark and it is completely different from any race I’ve run before because it is non-stop. You have the whole challenge of when to sleep and that becomes very tactical, and then you’re sleep-deprived. “When I was on the final section I kept seeing animals appearing out of every rock and kept forgetting what I was doing – hallucinations. Every so often I’d come to with a start. On top of that it’s very cold and I was wearing all of my clothes by the time I finished.” Paris’s performance was hailed by Jo Pavey and the British 2016 and 2017 marathon champion Aly Dixon,who tweeted: “I don’t understand why anyone would want to race 268 miles across the Pennine Way, in the winter. But I do know how enormous a woman winning the Spine Race overall and SMASHING the outright record is. It’s HUGE!!!”"
Keep on running with this smart sport tech,"Whether it be a training plan from an app such asTrainAsOneorZombies, Run!, or comparing results with fellow runners via a platform such asRunkeeperorStrava, technology has helped lots of runners off the start line, coached their performance and led them to become obsessed with their digital trails. Most start off tracking their runs with their smartphone strapped to their arm, but other devices can capture metrics beyond just pace and distance. This is a hefty watch, with a matching price tag. Within its titanium casing is a multitude of sensors that can track your activities (running, rowing, cycling, skiing, kayaking and pretty much anything else), your heart rate, heart rate variability (the time between the beats, an indicator of how stressed you are) and pulse ox acclimatisation (the amount of oxygen in your blood – useful if you are training at high altitudes). It can also prompt you along routes it has created, although in built-up areas these weren’t very runner-friendly. Apart from this gripe, it’s almost faultless and a powerful device. It’s straightforward to customise for the activities and data you’re most interested in, the screen is easy to read while running, the buttons make it simple to operate and the battery lasts for an age (Garmin claims 33 hours of GPS tracking or 20 days on standby). However, if you want something for urban running and some racing, something cheaper, such as a Garmin Forerunner 30 (£130) or a Polar M430 (£175), which have HR monitors and GPS, would be more than sufficient. Best for:ultra-active, high-net-worth individuals who like to run trails, swim wild, ski cross-country and paddleboard – before breakfast. The newest Apple Watch is a powerful tool for keeping track of your health and exercise. It can measure HR, HRV and VO2 Max; other useful features for runners include the ability to make contactless payments and listen to music without lugging your smartphone along too. The watch is, well, watch-size compared to other sports watches, plus it’s aesthetically pleasing enough to wear all day. Tracking a run with Apple’s Activity app works smoothly. Other apps and devices can write data to Activity, but this is haphazard, resulting in double entries or oddities, such as mistaking cycling up a hill as climbing up stairs. If you’re happy not to stray from the Apple apps, this is less of an issue but if you want to share your activities to another platform you would be advised to install theHealthFitapp, which can export your runs to Strava, TrainingPeaks and other platforms. For £2.99, this app removes one of the Apple Watch’s two drawbacks. The other issue is poor battery life, not surprising given its small size and the powerful chips and sensors. You’ll need to charge it most days, so using it to track sleep patterns is tricky and there’s not enough juice for tracking long bike rides with GPS. A new feature of the Series 4 is a wrist-based electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor; however, this isn’t enabled on UK devices until Apple gains the appropriate EU approval, since it is classified as a medical device. Best for:style-conscious runners This strap for Apple Watches already has EU approval to take ECG measurements, so it could be ideal if you are impatient for this function on the Series 4 or you own an older Apple Watch. The HR sensors in the Apple Watch and other devices work by using optical sensors in their rear to monitor blood flow in the wrist but the KardiaBand can pick up electrical activity from the heart. But why is this of particular interest to runners? An ECG can detect atrial fibrillation (typical AFib symptoms would be a fluttering or pounding feeling in the chest), whichis more common in middle-aged endurance athletesthan the general, sedentary population. To monitor your heart, you simply place your thumb on the metal tab on the strap for 30 seconds and the app will tell you if your heart is displaying any signs of AFib. The SmartRhythm feature will monitor your heart during runs and will prompt you to take an ECG if it notices anything untoward. If you have any concerns, you can show the results to your GP. Best for:runners with concerns about their heart As the name hints, these shoes claim to give a 4% boost to your performance, due to the carbon-fibre plate in the sole.Eliud KipchogeandAbraham Kiptumset world records this year wearing them in the marathon and half-marathon respectively. I ran 5k and 10k personal bests in these very light shoes, an improvement of 2.4% and 3.95% respectively. Is there any evidence to back up Nike’s claims? The 4% claim originated from a Nike-funded study but recently two independent studies have been published by US academics. The first found that the shoes do“enhance running economy”by 2.6% to 4.2% (depending on the comparison shoe). The second study concluded that the boost was due to the carbon plate acting as a lever for the foot and that the foam in the shoe’s sole possessed“superior energy storage”. Aside from the price, the only drawback seems to be longevity – their bounce is widely reported to fade by 100 miles. So they are definitely a shoe to save for (personal) best. Best for:special running occasions This is asmall podto attach to laces, which tracks how much power is generated as you run. You may be tracking distance, heart rate and pace, so why would you want to know your wattage? After monitoring your running habits for a while, the Stryd app can calculate the power you should run at for a particular distance, lessening the chances of you “blowing up” before the finish line. And if you are doing interval training, running in zones defined by power is more exact than using your heart rate, which will lag as you recover from exertions. In practice, the Stryd app was a bit hit and miss, sometimes underestimating distance by half, which messed up the power data. After reinstalling and resetting (and reverting to using a watch to track speed) it became more reliable.

"I’m glad I started a debate, says athlete who breastfed on ultra-marathon","Sophie Power was stunned to be a social media hit but is pleased maternal guilt is being discussed It was the image that triggered a global debate about motherhood. A little under halfway through one of the world’s most gruelling races,the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc(UTMB), Sophie Power, 36, was photographed at an aid station near the Italian ski resort of Courmayeur breastfeeding her three-month-old son, Cormac. Within days, the image had gone viral and was picked up by newspapers from India to Indianapolis. Now back at home in Islington, north London, giving her first interview to a newspaper, Power, who until last week did not even have an Instagram account, said she had been ill-prepared for the attention she was to receive on social media, but was pleased about the conversation she had started. “It has highlighted something that women feel really unable to talk about. There is this huge mother’s guilt that all the time you need to be 100% focused on your baby, and I’m saying that by not focusing on your own physical and mental health you can’t be the best mother. For me, personally, I need to be physically fit and have those mental breaks.Womenreally struggle to be open about saying that.” She said she had thought little of the photograph when it was taken. “In the picture, I’m just focused on feeding Cormac, pumping the milk. Probably a metre out of shot is my husband, John, trying to convince me to eat an avocado sandwich and going through my pack, changing over my head torch batteries, putting the food in there. Alexis [Berg, a photographer with the online running community Strava] asked if he could take the photo and we thought nothing of it. We thought it might make a small Strava story about women doing something a bit different during the race.” Considering she has run almost 50 miles, Power, co-founder of a company that tackles inner-city air pollution, seems relatively composed in the picture – especially compared with the exhausted male runner lying flat out on his back next to her. “I’d gone through the first night with no sleep, as a lot of runners had. But as a mother I was really prepared for that. In terms of sleep deprivation, I was probably the best trained person on the start line. I’d had 20 minutes’ sleep over two nights. But I was taking the race really gently. Some people racing UTMB were pushing themselves to the limit. I had to do the opposite. I was trying to keep a lot of food down for my milk supply. I was almost refreshed when I got there compared to a normal race.” Before the UTMB, which she finished in just under 44 hours, Power had run several of the world’s most famous ultra racesincluding the Marathon des Sablesacross the Sahara and the 153-mile,non-stop Spartathlon in Greece. “I started running in 2009 pretty much from scratch. I’d never run more than a mile in my life when I signed up for the Marathon des Sables not really knowing what it was. I signed up to an ironman barely able to swim a length of a pool.” To enter the UTMB, she needed to earn points by running other ultras. Power had a place in the 2015 UTMB but had to give it up because she was six months’ pregnant with her first son, Donnacha, now three. In contrast with injured athletes, the UTMB does not allow women to defer their places if they become pregnant. In 2018, having bagged another place, Power faced a dilemma: run or spend years amassing more points. “This would mean missing out. I never set out saying I had to finish the course. I just wanted to be in nature, to see how it goes.” It was the thought of running the final metres through Chamonix with Donnacha that had kept her going through the race’s toughest stages. “I had to tell him to slow down, he was too fast, my legs were too tired. I picked up Cormac about 50 metres from the finish and crossed the line with both of them.” While the photograph has been well received on social media, there has been a backlash. A Twitter poll by a runner’s magazine asking if readers thought Power’s actions were “gross, a little selfish” or “it’s her business” was taken down after readers complained. Overall, though, Power feels her 15 minutes of fame have sent out a strong and unambiguous message. “This picture has allowed women to say: ‘When we become mothers our self-identity doesn’t change.’ We shouldn’t have to lose who we were before we were mothers. Men certainly don’t. You see all these great pictures of dads crossing finishing lines with their babies. Why do we as a society see that as different for the mother?”"
Would more prize money make athletes run faster?,"Ultramarathons have never had big financial rewards. A trophy, a T-shirt and maybe some free trainers is considered a good haul – but is that about to change? Would you be more likely to set a personal best in your next race if someone offered you £100? How about £1,000? Or even £5,000? The people behind theUltra Gobi, a 400km single-stage desert race in China, are hoping to find out whether money can make a difference by announcing a $10,000 prize for anyone who breaks the 71-hour course record. “In 2017, Dan Lawson laid down an incredible gauntlet in the Gobi” says Pavel Toropov, the race director. “This unparalleled prize is a tribute to that performance and an incentive for the best endurance athletes in the world to challenge it.” Prize money in distance running is nothing new. Elite marathon runners receive significant appearance fees just to turn up and get six-figure sums for winning big races and setting records. Last year, Eliud Kipchoge was reportedly paid $1m to take part in Nike’s Breaking2 project and would have received a bonus had he broken two hours. But barring a fewisolated examples, ultramarathons have traditionally been lacking in major financial rewards. A trophy, a T-shirt and maybe some free trainers is considered a good haul. I once won some money for finishing on the podium in a trail run in Hong Kong – it worked out as just under £3 for each hour raced. But, given the rising global popularity of the sport, this is may change, with other races and sponsors choosing to follow Ultra Gobi’s example. There are two clear ways in which increased prize money is likely to improve results: the depth of the field and the intensity of preparation. Undoubtedly, prize money draws more competitors. Although ultra-running has become more popular, only a tiny proportion of the population ever test themselves over such long distances. If a greater pool of talented athletes were running ultramarathons then winning times should be faster. The East African Rift valley, home to many of the world’s greatest distance runners, offers a powerful illustration. Winning marathons has become the best route out of rural poverty. Competitive running is a central part of life in many communities, with almost every ambitious youngster trying their hand. But the absence of prize money has been cited a reason forthe lack of Kenyan athletes in ultra-running. Were this to change, it’s easy to see how standards could be raised. Super-ultra-distance races such as the Ultra Gobi suffer from specific challenges in attracting the best athletes. I can personally attest to the fact that running across the desert for three or four days with little or no sleep takes an enormous toll on runners’ bodies and can require significant recovery time. The money is thus a way to compensate athletes who might otherwise have chosen to compete in several shorter races. The second area in which prize money can be transformative is training. Sponsorship opportunities, primarily from shoe companies such as Altra, Hoka and Salamon have enabled a few elite ultra-runners to turn professional. However, many of the best endurance runners still combine training and racing with part-time jobs. Dan Lawson juggles running for Great Britain’s 24-hour team with cycle deliveries andrunning a service for recycling running kit. Prize money in ultra-running would enable more full-time professionals. Their preparation would also be enhanced by better access to facilities, be that high-altitude training, teams of support professional or simply more comfortable prerace transport and accommodation. (I have known some of the best runners sleep in airport lounges before competing in high profile events.) There is of course the risk that the incentive of prize money leads to less welcome training innovations. Ultra-running is in many ways ideally suited to illegal doping. Although there have been a few isolated cases, it is generally considered to be a clean sport, unlike marathon running or cycling. Big money could provide the motivation and the means for this to change. But what about the impact of money on a runner during a race? All endurance sports involve a tussle between mind and body. In his excellent new book,Endure, Alex Hutchinson carefully analyses the physical limits and, more importantly, the mental limits our brains impose to keep us safe. Hence the burst of energy upon seeing the finish line that, a few minutes previously, would have seemed impossible. The late stages of an ultramarathon are often as much about determination and desire as anything else. In a life-or-death situation most of us could push a little harder. And money can be a good motivator. A1986 studyfound that people could sustain a wall-sit for longer if they were paid. As Hutchinson says: “It’s sort of like being chased by a lion without the danger of getting eaten.” Endurance athletes may just be different. Underfed students with no other reason may sustain meaningless pain for a few minutes longer in return for some cash. Competitive ultramarathon runners have already chosen an extremely painful hobby and are likely to be driven by intrinsic motivation. In Hutchinson’s words, for “well-trained athletes, motivation may well be pretty close to maximal already”. Based on my own experience at the end of the Ultra Gobi, nothing short of an actual lion could have made me go any faster. There are some who are resistant to the introduction of big money into ultramarathon running. Fears around camaraderie, honesty and sportsmanship are valid, but I believe it can be transformative for the sport. Those nostalgic for the days of amateur athletics often overlook the fact that it was largely the preserve of the wealthy. Only people with private means can afford to dedicate themselves fully to an unpaid hobby. Consequently, many talented athletes lost the opportunity to realise their potential, and fans were prevented from seeing the best performances, as the sad case ofJohn Tarrant (AKA the Ghost Runner)so starkly shows. Bigger prize money in ultramarathons can enable a wider pool of athletes to dedicate more time and be better prepared. This will improve competition and standards. As a follower of the sport, the prospect of watching incredible runners break records and push boundaries is exciting, providing it is accompanied by appropriate safeguards to keep the sport clean and fair. Whether or not this money will drive individual runners to dig deeper is a more debatable point. Having seen the grit and determination shown by elite ultra-runners I am sceptical. Even the facial expressions of a runner such asZach Millershow that he is operating close to his mental limits. It will take a very well-funded randomised control trial to find out for sure. I also suspect that some records, like Yiannis Kouris’s 303.5km 24-hour run, could withstand almost any amount of funding. As for the Ultra Gobi, the $10,000 purse will add to what promises to be a thrilling 2018 race. With Lawson returning to the desert to defend his title and several other big names on show the competition will be fierce. Toropov is tipping a female outright winner: “Nikki [Kimball] is one of the few athletes at home with these kinds of distances. If she can recover from surgery she will have a good chance.” One thing is for certain, whether motivated by pride or profit, it will take a phenomenal performance to better Lawson’s record."
Ultrarunner smashes record for 66-mile Lake District challenge,"‘I needed to suffer,’ says Kílian Jornet after breaking record that had stood for 36 years Early on Sunday morning, as theLake Districtbegan to buzz with hikers walking in the glorious sunshine, Kílian Jornet took the first step towards another remarkable record. The Catalan, who last year climbed Everest twice in a week, and can run up and down Mount Blanc in under five hours, is one of the best known athletes in the fast-growing world of adventure sports. He had his sights on tackling the Bob Graham round, a challenge that involves running a 66-mile circuit of the Lake District, climbing and descending 42 of its highest peaks, in 24 hours. Only 100 hardy souls attempt it each year, and barely a third finish. Jornet, though, flew around and smashed the fastest known time for the route, which has stood for 36 years, by more than an hour. He reached the finish at Moot Hall in Keswick in an astonishing 12 hours and 52 minutes. “I knew I needed to suffer,” Jornet told the Guardian. “But it was a beautiful suffering.” The 30-year-old, who is 5ft 6in tall and weighs barely nine stone, started racing up and down the mountains in Catalonia as a three-year-old, and has been an ultrarunning star for a decade. But he conceded that the Bob Graham Challenge was among the toughest of his career. “In terms of running it’s very hard, because it’s long – 100km or more – and the elevation is huge. The downhills are very steep too so the legs get very tired and it’s always technical as well.” It did not help either that the temperatures in the Lake District were pushing high into the 20 degrees centigrade. He laughed when asked whether there was one particularly hard moment. “It was more the last four hours” he said. “It was very hot and I kind of hit the wall on Grey Knotts. I knew I just needed to suffer and just keep going. One more step. One more step. That’s where it got hard.” Jornet fuelled himself with energy gels, fruit, crisps and water. “There were some rivers in the mountains where I could refill a bottle,” he said, “and people gave me water”, but the biggest help he received was from other runners. There are no official route markings or aid stations on the fells; instead, runners rely on the community to help them navigate and finish. One of the rules of the Bob Graham round club is that you must be accompanied to the top of each fell – and to run a fast time, you also need people who know the route inside out. Luckily, Jornet was embraced by the community, and accompanied by some of the fastest and most knowledgeable runners in the Lake District. “That’s something that’s a big part of the round,” he emphasised. “It’s thanks to all these people that I was able to finish it. It was really nice that the person that organised all the logistics was Martin Stone [who was part of the road crew when the previous record holder Billy Bland did it in 1982]. “What made it even more special was that one of my pacers was the son of one of Billy’s pacers – and Billy was there, too. For me, it was so cool to be there with them: they know every stone of the road, of the mountain, and I learnt a lot during the run.” Another tradition is that those who have joined the exclusive club of finishers – there are 2,000 members from the event’s 86-year history – then come back to help other runners having a crack at it. Jornet, though, who has big name sponsors, has a host of races in his schedule. Will he do the same? “Yes! For sure!” he said. “I have some friends who want to do it and I think some of the guys who were pacing me, they have in their legs a very fast time. So I hope that they try soon – and that they can go faster than me.”"
Fell runner sets world record for 116-mile 'double Ramsay',"Nicky Spinks, a 51-year-old farmer, becomes first person to run Ramsay Round twice Amid the razzmatazz of the World Cup, Wimbledon and the Tour de France, one athlete has discreetly set a world record and raised the bar in UK long-distance mountain running. Nicky Spinks, a cattle farmer from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, achieved the first double of the Ramsay Round, a brutal and technical circuit of the hills and mountains above Fort William. It was the first double achieved on the route and marks another milestone in Spinks’s impressive career, placing her among the greats of British fell running such as Billy Bland, Joss Naylor and Kenny Stuart. A single round was first set by the Lochaber athletic club member Charlie Ramsay, from Edinburgh, in 1978. Spinks completed that and then turned around to retrace her steps, doing the “double Ramsay” and covering 116 miles (187km). Speaking to the Guardian as she reversed a cattle trailer at a market in Holmfirth, Spinks said it was one of the hardest challenges she had completed. “It was incredibly tough. The terrain was really rough and there were hardly any paths and I really couldn’t run that fast because of the heat. I’m not very fast anyway but at times I was going very slowly,” she said. Spinks, 51, completed the run in 55 hours and 56 minutes on Monday 2 July, having set out at midnight on Friday. After a good start and plenty of rice pudding and fruit salad, Spinks said she became “slightly worried” when her knees began to ache. She had hoped to complete the run in 48 hours and despite making up time on different sections was unable to achieve the target. “After starting out in the pitch black I realised that I wasn’t going to easily make time on the schedule. This was slightly worrying especially as both muscles above my knees were aching in a funny sort of way,” she said. “I hoped I wasn’t still tired from theGreat Lakes racetwo weeks before. I tried massaging them as I climbed but that made no difference. It wasn’t a pleasant temperature as it was sort of warm and cold at the same time. I was hot but my legs felt cold and clammy.” Six hours later, having dealt with cramp, dehydration, midges and the heat, Spinks said she was back on track and the rest of the run went well. “Despite everything, I still found it very enjoyable. It was an excuse to be amongst those Scottish hills and mountains that I have always loved.” Ramsay, Naylor and Spinks’s dog, Wisp, were at the finish to congratulate her. Wisp ran with her for two legs of the course, including one nine-hour stint, along with 18 supporters who carried her rations and clothes. During the run Spinks took seven breaks of no more than a few minutes. She celebrated with a double full English breakfast. Earlier this year, Spinks was awarded the British Empire Medal for her services to sport and charity. Spinks began running competitively in 2001 in a four-mile fell race. She had a hysterectomy in 2012 and has also had breast cancer. In 2011, she set a new women’s record of 64 Lakeland peaks climbed in 24 hours. Two years ago, she completed a 132-mile fell run across the Lake District’s highest peaks in less than 48 hours."
Ultra runner Kílian Jornet smashes Bob Graham endurance race record,"On a hot, sunny Sunday evening, the ultra running star shattered the Lake District record that had stood for 36 years The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. He is the biggest star in ultra running; the winner of some of the biggest races in the world. Last yearhe climbed Mount Everest twice in one week, without oxygen. And on Sunday night, Kílian Jornet was to be found making history yet again on the fells of the Lake District. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. The Bob Graham round is one of the most celebrated challenges in endurance sport, comprising a course of about 106km with an 8,200m ascent over 42 fells, which must be done within 24 hours. It was devised by a Keswick guest-house owner in 1932 and only about 2,000 people have completed the route within the time frame; becoming members of a very exclusive club. Yet, on a hot sunny evening, Jornet completed the route in 12 hours 52 minutes, shattering – by just over an hour – a record that had stood for 36 years. Billy Bland, who set that record back in 1982, and is now in his 70s,was himself out on the route to offer support– and in another echo from the past, one of Jornet’s pacers was the son of a runner who paced Bland. Jornet made a point of thanking Bland inan Instagram postafter the run. Jornet is one of the breakout stars of the ultra running world, with an autobiography –Run or Die– that was shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Books of the Year award, andhalf a million followers on Instagram. Yet very little fuss was made of the attempt, with indications only beginning to circulate on social media over the weekend that the run was under way. Attempts at the Bob Graham must adhere to very specific rules, including informing the club members that you intend to run the course and being accompanied by someone on each of the 42 fells so that they can verify the achievement (no GPS trace will do the trick here). This display of camaraderie and support is very much part of the round – it is an individual challenge that nevertheless relies on help from others, particularly when – like Jornet – you are not local and don’t know the terrain intimately. The course is divided into five “legs” and club members who have run the route before accompany the challenger on each leg. The third leg is considered the most difficult, with rocky ground and very steep ups and downs. Compared with some of the mountain terrain that Jornet lives and trains on, the elevation is not extreme – after all, Jornet holds the fastest known time for the ascent and descent of Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, Denali andEverest– but the ground can be very challenging, with loose rock and trails that would be easy to stray from. Jornet is only just returning from breaking his fibula in March, though is doing so in style, having won the Marathon du Mont Blanc just a week ago. But if the amount of time he took off the Bob Graham Round record is impressive, it is also worth noting that Jasmin Paris broke thewomen’s record in 2016 by two-and-a-half hours– and that the record for completing the round twice, back-to-back, is held by another woman,Nicky Spinks. Then again, there are only a tiny handful of people hardy – some might say foolhardy – enough to take on these challenges."
Big is beautiful: the razzmatazz of the grand ultra,"Having only previously run low-key races, how would Adharanand Finn rise to the challenge of 120km in the Italian Dolomites? I’ve been running ultra marathons for about 16 months now, but I’ve been mostly keeping tolow-key, smaller racessuch as theRing O Firein Anglesey, or theMiwok 100Kin California. These races are intimate: you get to know the other runners, the race organisers. You get to feel like an oddball as you shuffle alone at dawn through quiet country towns with your backpack and head torch. But with theUTMBlooming – the biggest ultra mountain trail race in the world – last week, it was time to get my first taste of the razzmatazz of the European ultra trail circuit, by taking part in theLavaredo Ultra Trailin the Italian Dolomites. The world of ultra running may still be little known in the UK or the US, but in France, Spain and Italy, these races are huge. In the piazza of Cortina d’Ampezzo, just before the 11pm start, the town is alive with noise and bustle. As well as the 1,600 runners cramming into the start area, thousands of people have come out to cheer us on our way, sitting high up on walls, dancing on hotel balconies, as a huge sound system gees everyone up. The race is 120km along some spectacular and steep mountain trails. It’s a daunting prospect, so I hang near the back as the moment to start approaches. Up at the front, superstars of the sport such as the Americans Hayden Hawks and Tim Tollefson, Fernanda Maciel from Brazil, and the former Nepalese child soldier Mira Rai, are introduced to the crowd to huge cheers. You rarely see this much excitement or buzz at the start of a road race. This is a sport full of colour and adrenalin, with lean, chiselled mountain men and women with tattoos and expansive handshakes everywhere. And a lot of beards. And then, as the clock strikes 11, and to the strains of the race’s theme tune, The Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone,we’re off. The showboating is over – now it’s time to run. With so many competitors, once we leave the town and head into the mountains, the narrow trails get congested to the point where I’m often forced to walk, or even stop completely. But this is good, I need to force myself to slow down in the early stages of these races. Too often in my fledgling ultra career I’ve set off too fast, too eager, and I’ve ended up being that guy slumped by the side of the trail at 90km, not sure how I’m going to continue. Not this time, I tell myself, as I wait for another bottleneck to clear. The night ticks slowly by, traipsing up and down through woodland trails, following the highway of head torches, until the chilly morning emerges suddenly and we find ourselves face to face with the immensity of Tre Cime, a huge trio of rocky peaks that seem otherworldly in the dawn light. After some pasta soup at a crowded aid station – who knew mini star-shaped pasta floating in vegetable stock could taste so good? – we begin the first long descent back down into the valley. These mountain races are, of course, a series of climbs and descents, and until today I’ve always struggled with both, having come to ultras from road running. But today, finally, it all starts to make sense. On the climbs, I have a new friend, a pair of Leki hiking poles. I’ve always been resistant to using poles in races. It reinforces the walking element of mountain trail running, which I try to ignore. I like to think of myself as a runner, not a hiker. This is ultra running, I tell myself, not ultra hiking. Besides, the runners I’m most impressed by, people such as Kilian Jornet and Zach Miller, seem to cope just fine without them. But the truth is that in a 120km mountain race like this, I’m going to spend a fair amount of time hiking up steep climbs, and poles certainly look like they might help. When I ran the100 Mile Sud de Francein October, I was pretty much the only person in the race without poles. Of course, you’re supposed to practice with poles before you use them. So you don’t trip yourself up. So you know how to store them when you’re not using them. So any number of a thousand possible unseen problems can be avoided in advance of the race. But practising with poles when you don’t live near any mountains is not easy. I tried them out on the coast path near my home in Devon, but the climbs are so short – even though they can be very steep – that I’m forever putting the poles away and getting them out again. It’s all good pole practice, but it slows your run down. So I do it once. It doesn’t seem so difficult. In the event, the race becomes the practice. By the time I’m finished, I have it nailed. I barely grip the poles, but let them mostly dangle in the straps around my wrists. That works better, and doesn’t rub my hands. And they really seem to help. It’s like having a rail to hold on to up the biggest ascents. Throughout the race, even though getting them out of my bag is a hassle, I use them on every climb. But it is the descents where things really click for me. I keep waiting for my legs to start complaining, but on each downhill I just let myself go, flying and skipping along through the field. From 900th position at the first checkpoint in the race, about 10 miles in, I gain around 100 places on every descent. People look at me racing by, particularly near the end, with a touch of annoyance. It does seem a little unfair to be making up so much ground on the downhills. They’re the easy bit. But why doesn’t everyone else go a bit faster? I know why. I’ve been there before, where your legs are so tired that even going downhill is a struggle, where your legs don’t want to, or can’t, lift your feet from the ground. Where all you can do to stop yourself sitting down is to keep up a slow, pained, forward shuffle. But after 10 ultra races, for the first time, I’m not that guy. I’m that other guy. The one who comes from nowhere, full of energy, skipping past you, and you think,bloody show off. In the end, I finish, 120km later and in 366th position, back in the buzzing town of Cortina. Twenty-one and a half hours. I grab my free beer and sit down in the square to take it all in. Something has shifted. My whole perception of time and distance seems to have changed, because suddenly it doesn’t seem that crazy to have been out running for so long. When I started ultra running, the thought of running for more than four hours felt a little insane. I remember the first time my GPS clicked past 30 miles and finding it hard to process. But now, well it seems sort of normal. Seventy-five miles is a long run, sure. But not that long. Still, I’m shivering and tired and night is falling, so I’m grateful that Giovanni, the owner ofHotel Villa Argentina, is a runner and has given everyone in the race his phone number so that when we finish he will come and pick us up and scoot us back to the hotel bar for pizza and lemon soda, followed by a long, warm bath. All those things that are just bloody incredible after a long run. Even if it’s only a 21.5-hour-long run."
What does running do to your brain?,"Neuroscientists have studied treadmill runners, ultramarathon athletes – and a number of lab animals – to investigate the effects of running on grey matter The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. It may seem obvious – as you push on through a long run, veering wildly between sensations of agony and elation – that running can have a huge effect on your state of mind. It is an intuitive idea that a growing number of neuroscientists have begun to take seriously, and in recent years they have started to show us what actually plays out on the hills and valleys of your grey matter as you run. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. Their findings confirm what many runners know from their own experience: we can use running as a tool to improve the way we think and feel. And we are now learning preciselywhyrunning can return focus, vanquish stress and improve mood. Plus we know why – if you’re lucky – you might get a brief glimpse of nirvana. It would be crazy to believe that running is a universal solution to all of our psychological challenges. Indeed, from your brain’s perspective, you may not want to push it too hard. German neuroscientists scanned the brains of some of the competitors before, during, and after theTransEurope Foot Race, in which competitors slog through 3,000 miles, over 64 consecutive days. In the middle of this absurdly extreme ultramarathon, the runners’ grey matter hadshrunk in volume by 6%: the ‘normal’ shrinkage associated with old age is just 0.2% each year. Luckily, the story doesn’t end too badly: eight months later the runners’ brains were back to normal. But if covering immense distances can be counter-productive, it is clear now that more moderate runs can result in very real benefits. First, in a world where smartphones bombard us with stimulation and blur the boundaries between work and life, a clutch of recent studies shows why going for a run can help regain a sense of control. A2018 experimentfrom West Michigan University, for example, showed that running quickly for half an hour improves “cortical flicker frequency” threshold. This is associated with the ability to better process information. Two others, from the Lithuanian Sports University and Nottingham Trent University, showed that interval running improves aspects of “executive function”. This is a suite of mental high-level faculties that include the ability to marshall attention, tune out distractions, switch between tasks and solve problems. Among the young people studied, measurable gains were clear immediately after10 minutesof interval sprints. They also accumulated afterseven weeksof training. A brainimaging studyled by David Raichlen at the University of Arizona ties in neatly with these results. They saw clear differences in brain activity in serious runners, compared to well-matched non-runners. For obvious reasons, you cannot run while you are inside a brain scanner, so the neuroscientists studied the brain at rest. First, they saw increased co-ordinated activity in regions, mainly at the front of the brain, known to be involved in executive functions and working memory. This makes sense. Second, they saw relative damping down of activity in the “default mode network”, a series of linked brain regions that spring into action whenever we are idle or distracted. Your default mode network is the source of your inner monologue, the instigator of mind-wandering and the voice that ruminates on your past. Its effects are not always welcome or helpful, and have been associated withclinical depression. Raichlen’s was a preliminary study, but if corroborated in the future, it will lend fresh weight to the idea that running can be a form of moving mindfulness meditation. Brain scans show thatmeditationand running can have a somewhat similar effect on the brain; simultaneously engaging executive functions and turning down the chatter of the default mode network. Again, this seems intuitively right: in the midst of a run, you are likely to be immersed in the present moment, tuned into your bodily state, and conscious of your breath. These are all key aims of mindfulness-based practices. Lacing up your trainers and going for a run could, therefore, be a way to reap some of the psychological benefits of mindfulness. Companies, too, are cottoning on to the therapeutic effects of running: I recently worked with running-shoe companySauconyto create apodcastabout the effects of running on the mind. All of this might start to explain why some people find that running, like mindfulness, can be a useful way to overcome stress and depression. Recent research from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden shows, at a chemical level, how running can defuse at least one important biological stress pathway. When you are under stress, metabolic processes in your liver convert the amino acid tryptophan into a molecule with the mumble-inducing name of knyurenine. Some of that knyurenine finds its way into your brain, where its accumulation has been stronglyassociatedwith stress-induced depression, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. When you exercise, the levels of an enzyme called kynurenine aminotransferase build up in your muscles. This enzyme breaks down knyurenine into the related molecule kynurenic acid, which, importantly, cannot enter the brain. In this way, exercising your skeletal muscles by runningclears from your bloodstreama substance that can cause mental health problems. It is important to note that, for technical and ethical reasons, some of the details of this mechanism have been proven only inlaboratory animals. At first glance, it is not obvious why working your leg muscles should have a direct effect on your mental state. This work provides rare insight into the often-mysterious links between brain and body – and is a powerful reminder that your brain is just another bodily organ. What you choose to do with your body will, inevitably, have psychological consequences. Running can do more for your mood than smooth out stress. Some lucky souls gloat about their experiences of the “runner’s high”, which, they claim, is a powerful feeling of ecstasy andinvincibility. Running has never quite done that for me, but we do now know more about the potent chemical rewards that running triggers in the brain. The popular idea of the “endorphin rush” was born in the 1980s and 90s, when a series of studies showed that the levels ofbeta-endorphin increasein your bloodstream during the course of a run. Beta-endorphin targets the same receptors as opiates, and has some similar biological effects. The endorphin rush hypothesis always had a flaw, however, since beta-endorphin does not cross readily the blood-brain barrier. And if it didn’t make it into your brain, how could it give you a high? In 2008, German neuroscientists put that right. They usedfunctional brain imaging to showthat, in trained runners, beta-endorphin levels do indeed spike in the brain after a two-hour run. Increased levels endorphin activity in the brain also correlated with the runners’ self-reported feelings of euphoria. It is not just home-brew opiates that can dull the pain and raise your spirits while you are on the run. Endocannabinoids are a diverse family of bodily chemicals which, like cannabis, bind the brain’s cannabinoid receptors. The levels of endocannabinoids circulating in the blood rises after 30 minutes ofmoderately intense treadmill running.Rigorous experiments, conducted on lab mice, show that running-induced endocannabinoids are responsible forreductions in anxiety and perception of pain. It is a good bet that the same mechanism works in our minds. For many of us, running may never deliver a drug-like high. But we now see why a run that feels like murder at the start can leave you feel satisfied and at ease by the home straight. Some of these studies are preliminary and need fleshing out. And it is definitely the case that your gender, genetic profile, fitness, expectations and many other factors besides will influence the way your brain responds to running. Even so, I read all these neuroscientific studies as good news stories. While the physical benefits of running and aerobic exercise are well established, we are starting to see why running can have profound benefits for mental health, too. Hopefully, knowing this will redouble your determination to get out there and run more often. Ben tweets at@mountainogre"
Just a baby ultra? Qualifying for the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc,"The UTMB is a serious challenge – at 105 miles, with a route that ascends 34,000ft, and traverses three different countries. But just getting through the qualifying races is an epic feat in itself When you tell otherultra runnersthat you are training for theUltra-Trail du Mont- Blanc(UTMB), they give you a certain look. Oh, you are a serious ultra runner. You can almost feel your trail cred rising. Not because theUTMBis the toughest race, or the longest, or in the most extreme conditions – although it is fairly extreme, being a 105-mile race around Mont Blanc that traverses a route with a total ascent of 34,000ft (10,300m) and passes through three different countries. The main reason they give you that subtle nod of kudos is because just qualifying for the UTMB is an epic feat in itself. To even enter the ballot for a place, you have to accumulate points by running three qualifying races. While you do not need to win or do particularly well in any of these races – unless you’re shooting for an elite place at the UTMB – you do need to finish them all within the cut-offs. That might sound reasonable, but the three races I had to do last year to accumulate my points included a 135-mile run around the WelshIsle of Anglesey, and a100-mile slogup and down the slopes of the Pyrenees in the south of France. Both these races have drop-out rates of around 40%. The second one took me almost 40 hours, running non-stop through two nights, hallucinating cocktail parties on candlelit verandas along the way, and leaving my toes feeling numb for months after. And that is just to qualify for the ballot. But now I have a place. The UTMB is also the most competitive ultra trail in the world, with more of the top elite runners turning up each year, treating it as the grand final, the unofficial world championships of the sport. I have no illusions about being competitive anywhere near the front of this race, but after just over a year of ultra running, when something has gone wrong in every race I have run, I am working on being as good as I can be, for what will be the culmination of my two-year ultra running adventure. It began last February when I decided to shoot for the UTMB and ran the first qualifying race, and my first ever ultra, a 35-mile jaunt along the coastal path near my home in south Devon. Since then, I have got lost in races, worn the wrong shoes, forgotten to carry water, had extreme lows – clinging to the side of a mountain during a storm in the night –and extreme highs, when I felt like superman, flying up Holyhead mountain 130 miles into theRing O Fire Anglesey race, unable to believe that these legs that had struggled even to walk a few hours earlier now felt brand new, straight out of the box and filled with rocket fuel. And so, with my entry to the UTMB confirmed, last weekend I took on one of two final warm-up races before the big one. It was a mere45-mile race along the Jurassic coastin Dorset. “Just a baby ultra,” I kept telling people beforehand. My latest lesson in this sport is never to underestimate an ultra race. The numbers in ultra running are so big and insane that they start to become meaningless in the space between the races, when you’re talking and thinking about them rather than actually running them. After some of the races I had already done, 45 miles seemed like nothing. That was until about 20 miles in, when I started cramping while climbing up some steps after running alongLulworth Cove beach. It was a hot day and I hadn’t taken in enough salt. Luckily the cramps went away, but then came three brutal hills in quick succession, cliffs, pure vertical madness, interspersed, of course, by three terrifying descents. By then, I was on the point of dropping out. I had my reasons clearly laid out in my mind. This was only a training race, and so 25 miles was quite far enough for a training run. And it was dangerous to run with cramps – they had come back a few times on those three hills. What if I got stuck on my own somewhere remote and couldn’t even walk. It was irresponsible to carry on. But something, and it is still hard for me to fathom quite what it is, pushed me on. Every time I resolved to stop, it said no. Go on, go a bit further. After a while, the miles still left to go and the distances already run started to blur, and my mind stopped counting, focused completely on the simple act of moving, even if it was merely shuffling. The cliff paths and seaside towns were full of holidaymakers enjoying a balmy weekend. I ran through them with my rucksack and the number pinned on my shirt like an oddball. But word of who we were had got out, and people cheered me on, telling me I was amazing, telling me to keep going. I tried to wave or smile back. When did I become the maddest guy in town? There were moments of exquisite beauty, when you would come across an isolated cove that took your breath away. In these ultras, you are so raw, that everything is more extreme. A hug from a loved one at an aid station, or the sudden appearance of nature in full bloom, can bring you close to tears. But you must go on. Perpetual forward motion is the goal. Race positions stop mattering – it ceases to become a race. I had started out with a goal time and position, but six hours on, none of that mattered. All that mattered was to keep moving, one step after another. The race ended atOld Harry Rocks. It was a setting to lift the spirits, but just finishing was ecstasy. To sit on the warm grass, take off my shoes and stare out to sea after eight and a half hours of running. In that moment, it all made sense. And so I have one more warm-up race left to go. A78-mile run through the Dolomitesin Italy. It is a scary prospect, lots more big numbers, but for now I am going to bask a little longer in the glory of another ultra completed. Another step along this crazy path I set out on when I decided, last February, to enter the UTMB."
Would coming last in a race really be so bad?,"As I trudged up Scafell Pike, I saw Ricky Lightfoot on his way down, on his way to setting a new course record. It made me reconsider how I’d previously felt about underprepared race stragglers ... ‘Oh boy,” I thought, watching a tiny figure descend through the mist towards me. He was heading back towards the fork in the path where I knew he should have turned right. “That guy is in trouble.” I was about a third of the way round theScafell Pike trail marathonbut he, it turns out, was not. He wasn’t in trouble. He was Ricky Lightfoot and he had taken that right, done a loop of the summit and was now heading swiftly back down in perfect accordance withnominative determinism. He was about two hours ahead of me –going by my speed, not his – and well on his way to setting a course record for the race we were both (supposedly) running. I trudged on up through the mist. I had trained hard for this event: I’d banked plenty of quality miles, run shorter fell races and got in a fair whack of hill training. It wasn’t enough. As I clomped up the severe, boulder-strewn flank of England’s highest peak I reflected on the steep, technical training that West Yorkshire hadn’t offered me and my failure to seek it out elsewhere. This was my fourth marathon, and it was not going well. A year or so earlier, I was running the Edinburgh marathon, a race that has a kinda-sorta out-and-back route, watching people go past me in the opposite direction. I was somewhere around mile 24 and on track for a respectable but thoroughly unremarkable sub-four-hour time. They were somewhere around mile 11, and already walking. It stuck right in my craw. I had trained hard, put in the miles, stuck to a plan and made a proper go of it. These day hikers clearly hadn’t. They hadn’t respected the distance, hadn’t felt the need to train properly and weren’t looking great for finishing inside the cut-off. I felt blearily indignant, personally affronted that these people thought they could just saunter through an event that I had trained hard for. As I blundered down Scafell Pike, now more than two hours after my Lightfoot sighting, I considered the fact that if I just relaxed a little along the tough, technical descent, I would probably roll an ankle. There would be no choice: I would have to drop out and I wouldn’t have to tell anyone that I just wasn’t up to it. Ireallywanted to not be running. I didn’t relax, though. Yet another few miles along, the route left the lake shore to swerve up another hill. Purely, I think, to round the mileage up to the required 26.2. I cursed the race planners and fought the urge to throw my pack on the floor in a hissy fit. When I finally tramped over the finish line I had been out running for seven hours and 40 minutes, almost double my fastest road marathon time. The annoying, radio-friendly house music the organisers had been playing at the finish had stopped by this point and there were just a few people left milling around. I was not quite the last, but I came 128th in a field of 154 finishers and was one of the few runners in that back 50 who didn’t fall into one of the senior categories. It took quite a while for me to draw a line between those mile-11 Edinburgh runners and myself, but I got there eventually. I am quite proud of my seven-hour, 40-minute Scafell Pike marathon. It was the best I was able to do at the time, somewhere out beyond the limits of any endurance event I’d done previously. But along with those mile-11 Edinburgh runners, I knew was part of a group you might call undertrained and underprepared; or who you might – if you were feeling more generous – consider to be stretching ourselves and redefining what we deem possible. It might depend on whether we have had the self-awareness to stand well back from the start line where we can’t get in your way. The Scafell Pike race was my last marathon. As I hobbled past that mercifully silent sound system, though, I learned that I could run for well over seven hours. That knowledge eventually led me to guess that I could probably run 100km, which in turn pointed me towards my upcoming attempt at 100 miles, a distance that was utterly incomprehensible to me a few years ago. I will almost certainly finish at the back of that pack, too. If there’s a crap DJ who’s already gone home by the time I stagger over the finish line, that will be fine.

Ultra runner Scott Jurek: how I eat,"He spent 46 days running more than 2,000 miles through the Appalachian mountains – what got him through it? At home, it’s a smoothie: fruit, greens, nuts, nut butter or flax oil and protein powder. Then, before my morning workout, some oatmeal and wholegrain toast with more nut butter. On a normal day I do 3,000-4,000 calories. When I was doing theAppalachian Trail, though, that went up to 6,000-8,000 cals and I still lost 8.6kg over the 46 days. Breakfast there was at 5am: a banana, a Cliff bar, and, my daily comfort, a coconut-milk cappuccino. I do all the cooking, and lunch is usually leftovers from the night before. On the trail, my wife Jenny and I were living in a van and, twice a day, she’d bring me a sandwich, or something warm – fries, hashbrowns, whatever she could find in the local diners or supermarkets that was vegan. On an ultramarathon, I snack twice an hour on sports gels and energy bars. At home it’s lighter: fresh fruit, popcorn, a second smoothie if I’m doing an afternoon workout. And lots of water, although I go by thirst as opposed to measuring it out. On the trail, I’d long for homely dinners with a beer and some friends – Thai curries, slow-cooked soups, stews … North: Finding My Way While Running the Appalachian Trailis out on 12 April (Random House Books)"
When 26.2 miles just isn't enough – the phenomenal rise of the ultramarathon,"They are an almost-impossible test of the human body and spirit, yet the number of ultramarathons has increased 1,000% over the last decade. Adharanand Finn asks what’s behind this rapid increase – and whether racing 100 miles or more is actually good for you Awhile ago, I was standing at the office tea point when a colleague who had heard I was a runner asked me if I did ultramarathons – the term for any foot race longer than the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon. He looked disappointed when I told him I didn’t. “Triathlons?” he asked. I shook my head. “Oh, just marathons?” In terms of impressing work colleagues, family and friends, it seems marathons no longer cut it. We are in the post-marathon age, when everybody knows somebody who has run a marathon. Now, it seems, a genuinely impressive feat has to be something longer and more extreme. Fifty miles is OK, but it’s better if you can reel off numbers in the hundreds, and preferably over an insanely steep mountain range, a desert or some perilous jungle. With more and more stories of ultra races circulating, you have to feel sorry for the person looking for sponsorship for a little marathon jaunt. But what is behind this inflation? Why are more and more people taking on races than can last days rather than hours? And is it any good for us? Steve Diederich runs theRun Ultra websitewhich lists the world’s biggest ultramarathons. He says that when he set up the site 12 years ago he found 160 races listed globally. This year he has over 1,800 races on the site – an increase of over 1,000%. TheGerman ultrarunning website DUVadditionally lists the results of many smaller ultra races, its database going all the way back to the first 89km London to Brighton footrace in 1837. Over the last 10 years it plots a similar 1,000% increase in the number of races. Ultra Running magazinein the US collates figures for north America, and again they tell a similar story of a rapidly rising sport, with the number of races and finishers increasing every year since 1981. In 2003, for example, almost 18,000 people in north America finished an ultramarathon. Last year the number was 105,000. And Asia, too, has seen an explosion in the number of races. Nic Tinworth, a race director in Hong Kong, says that 10 years ago there were six ultra races in the territory, but that now there are more than 60. “In previous years,” he says, “you could just turn up on the day and enter, but now the most popular races sell out in minutes.” Many of the world’s most oversubscribed races, such as theUltra-Trail de Mont-Blancin France and theWestern States 100in the US, have had to implement lottery systems to cope with the numbers wanting to take part. Diederich manages the entries for theMarathon des Sables– one of the most iconic ultras, traversing 156 miles of the Sahara desert. Despite the £4,250 entry fee, Diederich says the race sells out in minutes. So why are ever more people putting themselves through challenges that for most of us are barely imaginable? Since that conversation at the tea point, I have actually completed a number of ultramarathons. The intial attraction was the call of the wild. I had run six marathons when someone suggested I run the six-day, 165kmOman Desert Marathon. As a runner the race held little appeal, but as a life experience, an adventure, it was exciting: to cross a vast stretch of barely charted land with only myself and a backpack of energy bars to keep me going, was a thrilling prospect. Extreme athleteKarl Egloffknows the feeling. The Ecuadorian has run up and down both Kilimanjaro and Aconcagua (the highest mountain in the Andes) quicker than anyone in history. He says the appeal of racing up the mountains, rather than hiking up them, is the sense of freedom: “When I go up a mountain travelling light and moving quickly, it’s different. I feel free, like flying, like a condor.” While adventure has always appealed to the human spirit, Diederich puts the boom down to the growth of social media, which spreads the word and fires people’s imaginations: “People see their friends’ pictures and go, ‘Wow, I want to do that,’” he says. Some in the ultra world, however, are disdainful of the social media influence, saying it gives rise to people looking for kudos by calling themselves ultrarunners, and the sport has lost its edge as a result. Race director Mark Cockbain says: “So many races have popped up to capitalise on people’s desire to be ultrarunners and organisers make it so easy for runners to achieve this ‘status’ with ‘everyone-that-enters-is-a-winner’ and finisher-hand-holding events. Once all ultras had a sense of danger.” Paul Albion, who organisesBig Bear ultra eventsin the Midlands, agrees that social media has played a role, but sees the inclusivity as a positive. “With greater exposure to these sorts of events, people see that not all of the finishers are whippet-like men who climb like mountain goats,” he says. “Our finishers come in all shapes, sizes and ages.” Diederich feels there is a natural race inflation behind the rise in ultras. “So many people have done a marathon, that now if someone tells you they’re running one, you ask if they’re doing it in a panda outfit or something. Just running a marathon doesn’t mean much.” Another race director, Melissa Martinez, whoputs on events in North Carolina, agrees. “As people continue to see the marathon as more achievable,” she says “the human spirit will always crave more. It will always crave that feeling of pushing itself to the edge, and then continuing on in spite of the pain.” I often hear ultrarunners talking about pain and finding their limits. At theSelf-Transcendence 24-hour track raceI ran in south London last year, the race director told me it was to witness that moment when a person finds the strength to carry on, when they thought all was lost, that keeps her putting events on year after year. And I can say from experience that to be forced to dig deep inside yourself, to face pain and doubt, and yet to come through it, can be a life-affirming experience. Lindley Chambers, chairman of theTrail Running Association, says the ever-growing contrast between our normal, sedate lives and the feeling you get in an ultra of being fully alive and on the edge is key to the sport’s growing appeal. As the world becomes ever more sanitised and automated, where even cars drive themselves, a deep stirring grows to get out of our comfort zone, to feel something of our wilder selves. “As our regular, mundane lives become ever more sedentary,” he says, “we have a need for something more.” It was this need that first drew me to the desert in Oman, and it was there, on the start line on the last day, that I met a German couple in their late 60s. They looked completely shattered after five days pushing themselves on through the scorching heat. “Why do we do this?” Gudrun asked rhetorically. “We have such a nice home.” Her husband, Hansmartin, looked at her and said simply: “Because we have such a nice home.” In the brilliant documentaryThe Barkley Marathons: The Race that Eats Its Young, one competitor in the 100-mile race puts it more bluntly: “Most people would be better off with more pain in their lives.” Getting through the pain barrier, the wall, pushing beyond your limits, was once part of the appeal of standard marathons. But, according to ultrarunner Nick Mead, the feeling you get, the fabled runner’s high, is proportionally bigger in an ultramarathon. After completing his first ultra,Mead wrote: “The race pounded me almost into submission before I broke through and was lifted on a wave of euphoria unlike anything I’ve ever experienced … an almost spiritual high.” In his autobiography, ultra legend Scott Jurek describes being driven by a similar feeling: “The longer and farther I ran, the more I realised that what I was often chasing was a state of mind – a place where worries that seemed monumental melted away, where the beauty and timelessness of the universe, of the present moment, came into sharp focus.” The euphoria of running has indeed been proven to help relieve stress and alleviate depression, but does running further feel even better? Catra Corbet is a former addict who took up ultrarunning after she got arrested for drug dealing. “I’m always high out on the trails,” she says, when I meet her at a roadside Starbucks somewhere near her home in San Francisco. She’s 53 but looks about 28, with red hair, tattoos cascading down her arms and legs, and piercings all over her face. She has run 100 miles (in one go) over 130 times. “I like to do one or two 100-milers a month,” she says, as though they are trips to the beach. “Running saved my life. People go to AA or whatever, but I don’t. My recovery is out on the trail.” Yet, while it may bring a feeling of wellbeing, can running a hundred miles or more, often through the night and through challenging terrain, really be good for your body? In 2012, cardiologist-runners Carl Lavie and James O’Keefe caused a stir when theyreleased a research paperthat found that while moderate running was clearly healthy, those health benefits began to tail off and possibly even reverse if you ran “excessively”. Initially they defined that as more than 2.5 hours a week – though after further research Lavie revised it to five hours a week. Ultrarunners, of course, undertake much more than that, often in a single day. Lavie and O’Keefe’s main concern was heart damage and a hardening of the tissue around the heart brought on by extreme exercise. In aTED talk on the subject, O’Keefe said that while exercise was one of the best medicines for good all-round health, “like any drug, there’s an ideal dose range. If you don’t take enough, you don’t get the benefits. If you take too much, it could be harmful. Maybe even fatal.” Mark Hines is a professional adventurer, author and an exercise physiologist. He shares the health concerns about ultrarunning. “The biggest issue is permanent scarring of the heart tissue,” he says. “Anyone middle-aged running a marathon or more is likely to develop some level of scarring, and it is irreversible.” Lavie and O’Keefe were accused of putting people off running, and are now keen to stress that any exercise is better than no exercise. Dr Andrew Murray, a sports and exercise medicine consultant at the University of Edinburgh, who once ran 4,300km over 78 days from John o’Groats to the Sahara desert, emphasises the point: “There is a ceiling [in the amount of running you do] beyond which you start to lose the sweet spot healthwise. However it is very difficult to do enough to return you to a greater risk than couch potatoes.” The problem with relating O’Keefe’s study to ultrarunning is that he conflates intensity and duration of exercise to define “extreme”.Ultrarunningmay, on the surface, seem to be extreme, but in practice it is usually undertaken at a very low intensity – with walking forming a large chunk of most ultra races for most competitors. Indeed, Hines says he has started running longer races since he learned about the risk of heart scarring, because, he says, they are generally safer due to the lower intensity of effort. In 2014, Dr Martin Hoffman, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of California,ran a more specific studyon health issues related to more than 1,200 ultrarunners. He concluded that they were healthier than the non-ultrarunning population, with a low prevalence of virtually all serious medical issues, and that they had fewer sick days off work. “At present,” he told me, “there is no good evidence to prove there are negative long-term health consequences from ultramarathon running.” But are ultramarathon runners doing it to be healthy? No one I spoke to cited that as the reason. Hoffman followed up his research with a fascinating question posed to another 1,394 ultrarunners: “If you were to learn, with absolute certainty, that ultramarathon running is bad for your health, would you stop?” Seventy-four per cent of runners responded: “no”. Adharanand Finn is the author of a forthcoming book on ultrarunning, to be published by Guardian Faber in May 2019.  TheBarkley Marathonsis a 100-mile, unmarked trail race in Tennessee inspired by a 1977 prison escape. The brutal course and quirks of the race, such as an unknown start time, make this race so tough thatin its 33 years only 15 people have ever finished. The Sri-Chinmoy Self Transcendence 3100 Mile Raceloops around a single block in Queens, New York city – that’s 5,649 laps. This is officially the longest race in the world, and one of the least scenic. The fastest-ever winning time was 40 days and 9 hours. The Tunnel Ultrais 200 miles back and forth through the UK’s longest foot tunnel, situated under Bath in Somerset. Race director Mark Cockbain calls it “a mindbending test of extreme endurance and sensory deprivation”. 6633 Arctic Ultracalls itself the “toughest, coldest, windiest ultra distance footrace on the planet”. Crossing the Arctic Circle and traversing 350 miles of snow, ice and temperatures down to -50C, it is limited to 12 starters, of whom all but a couple will drop out before the end. The Spineis a self-supporting, self-navigating race along the full route of the 268-milePennine Wayfrom Edale in Derbyshire to Kirk Yetholm, Scotland. In January. While most of the running time takes place at night, runners often have to contend with snow, sleet or driving rain. The course record is 95 hours 17 minutes."
A 250-mile protest run: the fight to save Navajo land and US national parks,"When faced with Donald Trump’s plans to destroy areas of astounding beauty and cultural significance, an eclectic group of runners and Native Americans joined together to have their voices heard When an eclectic group of ultra-runners and members of the Navajo Nation were faced withDonald Trump’s plans to destroy their natural playground, they protested in the only way they could – they ran. If you asked the average runner what they enjoy most about their weekend runs they would probably all say something slightly different. But when you delve far enough under the surface, it all boils down to the same elusive concept: freedom. And nothing symbolises the liberating thrill of connecting to nature more than running through the panoramic expanses ofUtah’s Bears EarsandGrand Staircasenational monuments. So, when Donald Trump announced plans to sweep all of this away in the largest elimination of public land in US history, the obvious thing for runners and film-makers Johnie Gall, Andy Cochrane and Greg Balkin to do was to bring everyone together and run across it in six mile relays – all 250 miles of it – in a single weekend. The result is one of the most inspirational and unique environmental protest films you’re likely to see. “The idea was to use something we love – running – to celebrate the area and the immense cultural significance woven into it,” explains Cochrane. “We wanted to explore south-eastern Utah first-hand and build a relationship with the canyons, towers, mesas and the dirt, to better understand why the land – and places like it across the country – should stay public and protected.” And besides from their passion for the sport, Gall feels running is the perfect way to illustrate this. “When you have to carry your body across an entire landscape, you appreciate it differently. The speed of running allows you to see all kinds of nooks and crannies that you wouldn’t otherwise, but it’s still fast enough to cover a lot of ground quickly. In 30 hours, we covered 250 miles from the east side of Bears Ears to the far end of Grand Staircase-Escalante.” And with some of the most challenging ultra-running trails in the world, it’s also no surprise that the project attracted everyone from the world’s most formidable elite athletes to people who simply love pursuing the childlike wonder that you can only get from such an unforgiving landscape. “The group of 17 runners are all friends and friends of friends. The outdoor industry is a pretty small place once you’re in it”, Balkin says. “Andy’s biggest passion is trail running and he’s fortunate to have a big network of runners that he was able to tap into, from Olympians and professional runners to more casual, recreational runners to Navajo runners who consider it a big part of their history.” The Navajo have worshipped and lived off the land between the two monuments for centuries. There are more than 100,000 Native American archaeological and cultural sites in the area – which are still considered sacred by the ancestors of the tribes who worshipped here. As you would expect, they too have been tirelessly campaign to protect the area. In July 2015, leaders from five area tribes founded theBears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition– a consortium of sovereign tribal nations – to make the case for conserving the Bears Ears cultural landscape. “We have a Navajo friend named Len Necefer who is a pretty vocal member of the outdoor industry,” says Gall. “When the idea for the relay came up, we reached out to him to talk about how we could bring a strong Navajo voice to the story. He was stoked and helped recruit a few Navajo runners for the project. We learned so much from them during the run and have continued to do so since.”Far from sitting back with their feet in ice buckets, all three film-makers continue to dedicate themselves to the wilderness. It’s a way of living that sometimes flippantly earns them the nickname of ‘Dirtbags’. But Cochrane doesn’t mind. “Dirtbag is a term of endearment in the outdoor world. It was first used to describe pioneering rock climbers of decades past – guys who would live in tents and eat cat food to have the freedom to pursue rock climbing year-round. All three of us and some of our runners have lived in vans, buses, trucks or tents at some point or another, pursuing our passions.” And as long as the great open spaces we treasure continue to resist the destructive forces of development, we should probably be thankful for all the ‘Dirtbags’ championing our running trails."
Why don’t Kenyans run ultramarathons?,"East Africans dominate long-distance running up to 26.2 miles – but longer races are almost exclusively white affairs. As ever in top-level sport, money has a lot to answer for In the world of ultrarunning, one race stands out as the most competitive, the Super Bowl, the London marathon of ultrarunning: it is theUltra-Trail Mont Blanc. Since getting involved in ultrarunning a few years ago, I have followed the race online each August. The start is stirring stuff: more than 2,000 athletes gather inthe town of Chamonixin the Alps, with the sport’s crème de la crème gathered at the front. These are the supermen and superwomen who will race around the 105-mile route at mind-boggling speeds. They are among the greatest athletes on Earth. Yet, watching it, I saw a big, red flag flying that no one else seemed to mention. Everyone on the start line was white. If these were the world’s greatest distance runners, where were the Kenyans? I don’t need to explain to readers of this blog that Kenyans, along with their neighbours in Ethiopia, dominate the world of long-distance running in distances up to and including the marathon. After that, however, they don’t feature. Why? Asking people at the centre of the Kenyan running world,in the town of Iten, about ultrarunning brings mostly puzzled looks. What is this thing you speak of, they ask? Running further than a marathon? Is that possible? I told one 2hr 4min marathon runner that I had run 100km. He looked at me in disbelief and asked me how many days it had taken. I know 100km is a long way, but if you can do 42km in just over two hours ... well, do the maths, it is less than a day. But the concept was so alien that he couldn’t get his head around it. Left with this puzzle, I decided to do something potentially disastrous, but also potentially gamechanging for Kenyans and for ultrarunning: I decided to introduce them to each other. The big barrier to this is, of course, was money. In Kenya, there are no managers looking for ultrarunners, no one willing to pay for a plane ticket to a race in the hope of cashing in on a share of the winnings. This is because the winnings are small or non-existent.Money is a key motivator for many Kenyan athletes: running offers them a way to change their lives, to escape poverty and to help their families and communities. They don’t always have the luxury of doing it just for the love of it. Yet, as the sport of ultrarunning grows, so do the opportunities to earn money. A handful of top ultrarunners now have agents securing them big sponsorship deals and a few races are putting up big cash prizes in the hope of luring the top competitors. So, for those thousands of Kenyans who dedicate themselves to training and live like professional athletes, but who can never get a spot in a road race, ultrarunning could offer an outlet for them to express their talents. Not everyone in ultrarunning loves this idea. One senior person in an ultrarunning company told me he hoped Kenyans would never discover ultrarunning, for fear they would “kill it by winning all the races”. He said he believed it was a question of branding, that people don’t care when a Kenyan wins a marathon, because they are “machines made for running”. But Kenyan runners are not machines: they work hard to achieve what they do and they deserve the same opportunities as everyone else. Their stories are just as compelling if people take the time to listen. Luckily the rest of the ultrarunning community has been more welcoming, with top US runners Sage Canaday and Gary Gellin alreadyputting some money forward to help the project. Ultrarunner Zach Miller told me he would relish the opportunity to race some top Kenyans and had invited them to train with him in Colorado. My belief is that Kenyans taking part in ultrarunning can only elevate the sport and add another layer of interest by making it even more competitive. It will be a global sport only when its doors are open to everyone. So, a wheel has been spun. Some friends in California and I are crowdfunding to cover the costs for two Kenyans to train for and race inthe Lake Sonoma 50-mile ultra racein northern California in April. The race team is delighted, with race director John Medinger saying he was “thrilled to have them” at Sonoma. Convincing Kenyans to take up the challenge has not been easy, but two athletes agreed to put their marathon-running aspirations on hold for a few months to see what would happen if they took to the trails. The first is Francis Bowen, a 2hr 8min marathon runner at his best (he ran his PB in 2011). Now 43, Francis may be the fastest marathon runner ever to try a trail ultra. That is an exciting prospect. The second is Risper Kimaiyo, who has in fact run one ultramarathon, the 50km world championship in 2016 in Qatar.She won. “I just enjoy running long distance,” she says. She trained in South Africa for a while – where ultrarunning is more common – and says she used to run 70km every Saturday. That is why she decided to put herself forward for the world championships. “I went to Qatar and I came up liking it [ultrarunning],” she says. Yet, despite being the world champion, she hasn’t been able to race an ultra since. The opportunity just didn’t exist. Until now. To help Francis and Risper train for and travel to the Lake Sonoma 50,please pledge your support here."
Are you ready to run your age?,"How can a runner celebrate their birthday? By running their age in miles or km This week I turned 30. My to-do list for the day read: I can’t stand the fake intimacy of general, automated emails, so No 3 acts as a good annual cull. And I’ve never understood why birthdays are about celebrating the child for a passive act of which they have no recollection rather than the mother for whom it was probably arduous and highly memorable, hence the flowers. But throughout my adult life, I have found myself at a loss for what to do with the rest of the day. Eating cake is undoubtedly pleasurable but, as an ultrarunner, it is also an at-least-daily occurrence. So, from now on, I intend to run my age in kilometres each year. Cynics will no doubt point out that I have taken the easy option by choosing metric rather then imperial measurement. But 30 miles before work seemed a tall order and I need to think a few decades ahead. It turns out I am far from being the first to adopt this annual tradition.David McGillivray, the race director for the Boston marathon, has been running his age in miles since his 12th birthday, back in 1966. He was still going strong at 60. Ultrarunning is, after all, a sport for the older runner. Theaverage age of participants is 43and runners in their 60s, 70s and 80s are not uncommon. And records for mature runners continue to fall. At 70,Bob Beckercompleted the notoriousBadwater Ultra(135 miles) in 41 hours.Gunhild Swanson, also 70, finished the gruelling 100-mile Western States race. And in 2016,Ed Whitlockbecame the oldest sub-four-hour marathon runner at the incredible age of 85 (he also held the sub-three-hour record at 74). With this sort of pedigree, the birthday ritual could be continued almost indefinitely – provided, of course, it doesn’t hasten life’s final ribbon. Have any of the Guardian running community been following similar traditions? Does anyone want to start? I can attest that it definitely makes the cake taste better ..."
Running away: the paths of the gods on the Amalfi coast,"Offering beautiful views, steep flights of stairs and the option of post-run pizza refuelling, the paths of the Amalfi coast are a trail runners paradise The Amalfi coast is stunning - and hotels and restaurants in the area can have prices to match, particularly in high season. So the best option, particularly for a group or a family, is to hire a villa. TheLuxury Travel Bookhave numerous properties along the whole Amalfi coast (and the rest of Italy, and indeed beyond) ranging from €700 (£613) for a week to the sky-is-the-limit. We stayed in the beautifulViale Pasitea, a split level property (you can hire it as separate apartments, or as one huge villa) with a beautiful terrace over the sea. The full property, beautifully furnished with classic pieces and comfortable beds and sofas, will comfortably sleep 12 people, and the bedrooms are generous, with plenty of space for as many outfits as you could possibly bring. After all, to fit in in stylish Positano, you need multiple wardrobe changes daily ... The villa is right in the heart of the town, up (or down) one of the innumerable steps that criss-cross Positano, and indeed the whole coast. Down the steps is the main beach, where you can sunbathe, look beautiful or scoff gelato while waiting for one of the local ferries, which can take you to Naples, Sorrento, Amalfi, or the islands of Ischia and Capri. Up a few flights is an excellent local minimarket After an active day working up a sweat on those trails, it is the perfect retreat. Positano can be busy at peak times, but shut the gate to the villa’s garden terrace and you are in sunny oasis of calm, the perfect spot for sipping a well-earned Aperol spritz. The kitchen, too, is excellent: huge and remarkable well-equipped, ideal for whipping up pasta. If the evening is still warm you can dine on the terrace, if a nip is in the air then the large dining table inside. Oh, and there is - of course - excellent wi-fi, so you can upload your day’s activities to Strava the second you are back. Who wouldn’t want to walk in the steps of the gods? Or, at any rate, run and/or hike thePath of the Gods. This stunning route winds through and along the sheer cliffs of the Amalfi oast. Around every corner is a view of the sparkling Mediterranean, or a bird’s eye glimpse of the coastal towns and villages, like so many dolls houses interspersed with the dark green of olive tree foliage. The full path is about 13km (8 miles), and you can travel it in either direction, though the views are better if you go from east to west (starting in Bomerano, ending in Nocelle, just outside Positano). Moving in that direction means the best views are always in front of you, and also means the sun will be behind you in the morning – better for both taking photos and not boiling if you are there in the summer heat. This direction also gives you slightly more downhill, though the trail is technical at times, and there certainly plenty of unrunnable stretches – and why would you want to hurry anyway? Some parts of the path also require careful map reading – for which I thoroughly recommendthis guide/leafletwith helpful photos fromGiovanni Visetti.This detailed guideis also worth printing out, as it lists some picturesque views/pit stops for water en route. For those who prefer a smoother surface, road running is possible. You just need to keep your wits about you, andget up very early. The roads along the coast soon become very congested with slow-moving coaches (followed inches behind by impatient Italian drivers) and there aren’t any pavements to speak of, so you are taking your life into your own hands. A much better option – if you don’t want to embark on a long trail run – is to find a quiet stretch of hill path and run hill repeats. Of course, you could enter an organised race. The stunningAmalfi Coast Trailtakes place on 26 March and is a stage race totalling 94km, with 5,300 metres of elevation gain. It’s a very small race, of just 40 runners, with an option for 20 trekkers too – this is split over five stages, so it is entirely doable with a reasonable level of fitness. It also functions as an active form of run-tourism itself, incorporating a visit to Pompeii, a section taking in Vesuvius and a start on the island of Capri. Another beautiful option in the early summer is theAmalfi-Positano Ultra Trail, taking place on 26 May 2018. This is actually a series of races, from the50k ‘full’ ultra, down through a 35km ‘Trail of the Sirens’ to a 17km ‘Trail of the gods’. The same organisers also run the wonderful-soundingAmalfi Positano Wine Trail, two races in the Furore vineyards, on 27 October. Then there is the newCoast to Coastrace, travelling from Sorrento direct to Positano. Last year’s race comprised an ultra – 54km – and a shorter, 28km race, as well as a 2km funrun open to all. The dates for 2018 haven’t yet been announced, but it’s likely to be in December. Then, of course, there’s a marathon (isn’t there always?). The Naples marathon takes place later in the year – date, again, TBC – but thehalf marathontakes place on 4 Feb. And really, what better place in the world could there be for pre-race carb loading than the birthplace of the pizza? An important note for all racers, however: in Italy (as in France) it is mandated by law that you must present a medical certificate, authorised or signed by a doctor, to prove you are fit enough to run. Many races provide a sample form that you can print out and bring to your GP (who may or may not charge a small fee). Driving in Italy is, well, less than relaxing. Getting our hire car back from Positano through a thunderstorm, around coastal winding roads, during rush hour, to Naples was an experience I never, ever wish to relive. But providing you don’t mind public transport and can live without your own car, it’s entirely possible to get from Naples to Positanoby bus– there are two direct ones each morning, or you could get the hourly train to Sorrento then a bus onwards from there. Or you could even explore the ferry timetable, to do part of the journey by sea. A more pricey option is to hire a taxi, though you could save some money by sharing ashuttle."
A loop eternal: welcome to the Big Dog Backyard Ultra,"It’s a simple conceit – a slightly more than four-mile loop that you run once an hour until all your competitors have dropped out. All very straightforward, until you hear how far the winner ran .... Run a single loop measuring 4.16667 miles within a single hour. Now do it again. And again. Now keep doing it – starting a new loop on the hour, regardless of how fast you finish the previous one – until there’s only one runner willing or capable of doing so. Welcome to the simple – some might say sadistic – concept of theBig Dog Backyard Ultrain Bedford County, Tennessee. “The apparently weird loop-distance has in fact been carefully chosen so each 24 hours equals running a perfect 100 miles,” saysGuillaume Calmettes, the Frenchman who is the current Big Dog Backyard Ultra champion. “Another twist is that every 12 hours you change between a daytime trail loop to a night-time road loop, and because the road loop has less elevation gain – and is of course less technical – than the trail loop, then reaching the road loops gives you the opportunity to get a bit more rest time in between loops, and more time to take care of yourself before starting the next one.” Calmettes winning distance wasan incredible 246 miles. That’s 59 loops over 59 consecutive hours. Obviously the Bad Dog Backyard Ultra isn’t for everyone. It’s leftfield events like this and theinfamous Barkley Marathons– both devised by the savant of suffering, Lazarus Lake – that attract a certain breed of ultra runner. The 2017 edition had one of the deepest fields to date, or as Calmettes puts it, “everything you want for good entertainment: Barkley finisher; 24hr world championship medalist; Badwater champion; Vol-State 500k champion; six-day running specialists; 100-mile winners, and so on. It was pretty humbling being surrounded by greatness everywhere,” he says. So how to approach a race with no discernible end – a race where your competitors dwindle as the physiological and psychological torment picks off victim after victim? Quite easily, it seems, if you’re Calmettes. “Because there is no predefined finish, you cannot think in terms of ‘how many miles do I have left before this thing is all over’, so in fact, I found it very easy mentally. I just had to think about the next loop. The next loop, always the next loop, it’s very easy thinking,” he says. “You’re never overwhelmed by what you have left to run, because you simply don’t know what you have left to run.” In this case ignorance is, without doubt, bliss. Another unique aspect of the Big Dog that turns the traditional race experience on it’s head is position. It doesn’t matter if you finish a loop quickest or slowest. Once you finish it within the given hour, every runner begins the new loop tied for first place. In fact, it almost sounds easy. Until it sinks in once again that Calmettes ran for almost two and a half days straight – through storms and rain – to take the prize. It’s a measure of his character that the race’s highpoint for him wasn’t, in fact, winning but a moment when his last surviving rival, Harvey Lewis, finished loop number 56 with only two seconds to spare. The two took off into the next loop like a couple of sugared up school kids – ticking it off in just 41 minutes. “Pushing on a muddy and slippery trail loop with a friend after 57 hours is something special and pretty fun,” he says. The end came soon after, Lewis quietly dropping out during the 59th loop – leaving Calmettes to unknowingly complete what was to be his final, winning lap. “The problem when you win Big Dog Backyard Ultra is that it means that you did not really reach your limits; your race stopped because all the others runners called it quits, not because you decided that it was enough,” he says. “Now that I know that I can cover at least 246 miles and stay awake for 59 hours straight, I am even more curious of what I can really do. So yes, I am definitely coming back, and hopefully we’ll hit a third night next year.” As a final, devious twist, the prize for winning is a starting place at the Barkley Marathons. Will Calmettes take up the offer? “Of course! You cannot say no to a Barkley entry,” he says."
Five lessons from a year of ultrarunning,"Being an experienced runner, I was mistaken thinking that ultras would be more of the same. But making sure you prepare your head, body and your feet makes a world of difference The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. Before this year, I was a reasonably proficient marathon runner (PB: 2hr 50min), but I had never run an ultra – a foot race longer than a marathon. Intrigued by the ever-growing popularity of these races, I decided to ratchet up the distances. I ended up running six ultras in 2017, the last three of them in a mad five-week period, culminating with the epic100 Miles Sud de Francein the Pyrenees last month. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. It has been a steep learning curve, and by the end of these races I knew things about how to survive and complete an ultra that I didn’t know before – things that might help others embarking on one in the future. Of course, not everyone will agree, and there are many ways to approach an ultra, but just turning up with a pair of running shoes, some water and a few gels, as I did for the first one, and like you can in most shorter races, is not advisable. Ultras take planning. You need to be organised. That’s lesson one. It’s a lesson I learned the hard way, and many are the times I’ve stood alone in a stew on the trail cursing my poor preparation. One time was near the end of the second day of theRing O’ Fire ultraI ran in Anglesey in September. The race is one complete lap of the Welsh island on the coastal path. I can just follow the signs, I thought. But when I got there, the other runners were all clutching well-marked maps. Others had phones with advanced trail finding apps downloaded. And all with good reason, because it turns out the coast path is not always easy to follow. The first day, a mere 35 miles, I got around by sticking like glue to other, more organised runners. But I realised this was not a foolproof system, so that first night I found a map and hastily drew the course for the remaining two days on it. I also installed theViewranger appon my phone and downloaded the GPX file of the course, which had been on the race website all along. But 62 miles into day two, as darkness was descending, I came to a crossroads. The sign for the coast path said turn left. My map said go straight on. I pulled out my phone. It was dead. Did I trust my map or the sign? I went for the sign as, in my haste I’d been far from careful plotting the route, I now realised. I’d just drawn it on my map roughly, thinking that would be close enough. An hour later I was waving down cars, knocking on the doors of tiny cottages, scaring the life out of the local people, trying to find out where the hell I was. After more 12 hours running I was a mess. A mess of my own making. Case study number two: coming out of Py in the Pyrenees, 11 hours into the 100 Miles Sud de France, as night fell, I pulled out mybrand new Petzl MYO head torch. A top-of-the-range beauty straight out of the box. The light it gave off, though, was a bit dim. Maybe this was some clever lighting system that I hadn’t seen before. Dim light so you could see other things? No, that didn’t make sense. Then I realised – the batteries were dead. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t checked them before the start. I stood cursing myself once again. (Luckily the organisers insist you bring spare batteries and a spare head torch, so I did just about manage to make it through the night.) Every article on ultra running talks about this, and I’d read them all. I’d heard the quote countless times that an ultra is really just an eating competition with some running thrown in. But when you come from a road running background, it can be a hard message to fully take on board. So in theMiwok 100km race in California– my second ultra – I spent 20 miles struggling, weary, barely able to get myself beyond walking pace. Then at an aid station at 50 miles, some guy saw me trying to fill my pitiful thimble of a fold-up cup with a drink. “That’s not a cup,” he said. “This is a cup.” He thrust a cup the size of a pint glass in front of me and filled it to the brim with an energy drink. I drank the whole thing down. Ten minutes later, I was running like a maniac, sprinting up hills, whooping as the other runners grimaced at this hyperactive imbecile in their midst. I felt so good I ran right passed the next aid station without even stopping. Big mistake. Lesson still not learnt. Ten minutes later, I crashed again. So, eat, drink, run, eat, drink, run. That’s an ultra. For those races that make you bring your own cup, I now carry a huge, lightweight plastic vessel attached to the outside of my bag. And, at every aid station, I fill it to the brim. This may not be an issue for those with feet made of hardened leather, but for people with regular, soft, delicate feet like me, take note: you will need more cushioning for an ultra. This may be obvious, but I’m a steadfast believer in minimal running. I’ve spent a long time learning to run with good form and I long ago stopped heel striking. It means I can (usually) run in nice light racing flats. Even in marathons I cruise around wearing shoes specifically designed only for 5ks and 10ks. So I thought I could do the same in my ultras. I couldn’t. In each race, I spent the last third or so with my feet on fire, trying to avoid any bit of hard ground, preferring whenever possible to run through long grass (slower) than on baked earth or tarmac (faster). This impacted on the rest of my body as I tried to change my form to protect my feet. I would finish each race in my minimal trail shoes glancing jealously at those people wearing those big fluffyHokas. “It’s like running on a bouncy castle,” one Hoka runner told me.Eventually I caved in and got a pair. And I have to say, they were a revelation. In the 100 Miles Sud de France, I was on my feet for almost 40 hours. That is a long time. My hip flexors ached, my quads were like bricks, by the end I was hallucinating ... but my feet? My feet were fine. This won’t be popular with everyone, and it has its drawbacks, but I found knowing that I still had 40 miles, or 50 miles, left, when I was already feeling dead on my feet, only stressed me out. Then, after what seemed like forever of running, I would look at the watch again and I’d have 39 or 49 miles left. It killed me each time, like running into a hedge. So in the 100 Miles Sud de France, I didn’t start my GPS. I just used the time, to get a rough idea of whether it was day or night. And mostly I felt more relaxed. I asked many top ultra runners for their advice before I set out on this journey, and almost all said to try to stay in the moment, to take it one step at a time. This is sensible advice, crucial even, but almost impossible with a constant bleeping reminder on your arm of how far you still have to go. Without it, I just kept moving, legs turning, up and down, through whatever the race threw at me until I got to the finish. Which, it turned out in France was more than 100 miles from the start, according to those whodidkeep their watches on. Seeing your watch click past 100 miles and to realise the end is still nowhere in sight must be incredibly debilitating. But me, I ran on in blissful ignorance, churning away, like a monk mediating on the moment. Well, sort of. So, now I’m an expert, which is lucky because I’m hoping to run the most competitive ultra in the world next year,the Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc. I’ll need every advantage I can get to finish that in one piece, so if you have any tips of your own, please share them below."
Ultrarunner Zach Miller: ‘I love digging in the pain cave’,"In the world of ultrarunning, he is a cult figure, winning his very first race in record time and charging towards the finish line while others jog. What’s his rush? Zach Miller is stirring porridge on top of a wood-burning stove. Outside, snow lies on the ground surrounding his log cabin. We’re halfway upPikes Peak, a 14,115ft mountain in the Colorado Rockies. The front door opens and a runner steps in, a man in his 50s, red-faced from the effort of getting up the mountain. Through the door, the early morning sun flashes off the frozen forest. “I can’t believe you’re here,” the man says, beaming at Miller. “You inspired me to run, man.” Miller, 29, is something of a cult figure in the world of ultrarunning – long-distance races of any length beyond a marathon, often 100 miles or more. I first heard about him last year, when he was tearing away at the front of the world’s most competitive ultra race, the 105-mileUTMBin France. He finished sixth, but for me, along with many others, the most memorable thing about the race was Miller’s swashbuckling attempt to destroy the field from the start. The accepted wisdom is that it’s best to start off steady and conserve energy: if you go charging off like a startled horse, you’re usually in for trouble. But Miller ran without fear, constantly pushing the pace, and buckling only at mile 92, when he finally surrendered the lead. Later that year, Miller popped up again ina video that went viral in the running world. It’s the last mile of another fiercely competitive race, the North Face 50 (miles) near San Francisco, and he is leading. He’s well clear of his rivals, but again he’s turning conventional wisdom on its head with his guts-out approach. In ultrarunning, competitors usually finish at a jog, enjoying the last section of the race, waving to friends, often embracing family before the finish line and crossing it with them. What’s the rush, after such a long race? But here is Miller, well clear and heading for an impressive victory, still running as if his life is in danger, arms pumping and breathing hard. He keeps it up right to the line, before collapsing into the arms of his girlfriend. It’s this all-or-nothing approach that has made Miller such a hero. “This guy has a God-given gift to connect with people,” the visitor says. “He’s so inspiring. My friends laugh at me, say I have a man crush. They don’t get it.” The man has time for only a quick selfie with his hero before he has to head back down the mountain. It’s six miles to the nearest road. It took me three hours walking briskly, leaving in the heat of a warm day down in the town of Manitou Springs and trekking up through dry scrub to forest and then snow. Miller’s cabin is part ofBarr Camp, an off-grid hikers’ refuge halfway up the mountain. It gets electricity from solar panels and filters water from a stream. Along with his sister and her husband, Miller is the caretaker: his jobs include cooking breakfast, chopping logs for the fire and mountain rescue. Many hikers who stop by have no idea who he is, but often, his sister says, people come up all this way simply to catch a few moments with him. If he’s out for a run, they’ll sit and wait. “People think it’s lonely living up here,” Miller says, “but I interact with people more than if I’m in town. People don’t just burst in through the door like that if you’re in your home.” Miller has lived here for two years, coming off the mountain only for races, often in far-flung corners of the world. It’s perfect training country. For his core strength, Miller likes to chop wood. “I spend a lot of time up here doing manual labour. I love it. The North Face 50 race was at the end of the fall, and I’d spent all fall splitting wood and hauling it into the store. I was pretty strong.” When he’s not chopping wood or clearing snow, Miller heads off into the mountains to run for hours at a time. He is a low-tech guy: he doesn’t have a coach or follow a training schedule, and his watch doesn’t have a built-in heart monitor or GPS; it’s a $5 Casio he bought in a market in Portugal. He used to race without a watch, but he kept missing his meals: in ultrarunning, you need to eat at regular intervals, otherwise your energy stores can crash badly. He usually runs about 20 miles a day, sometimes 30. “I don’t really count,” he says, “but something like that.” In winter, when it gets dark early, he often runs at night in special snowshoes fixed to the bottom of his trainers. It may seem a hard existence, but the effort is something Miller relishes. “I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and loved helping my dad outside. I have this fascination with manual labour, just getting things done, seeing progress, whether it’s mowing the lawn or clearing snow.Runningcan be like that.” Pain is not something he shies away from. “I love digging in the pain cave,” he says. “I hate it, and I love it. And I think people identify with watching someone who’s really trying their best, someone who’s struggling, but is still trying to push as hard as they can.” Once, when the camp was busy and he didn’t get his run in, he decided to run to the top of Pikes Peak at 2am. The summit is 4,000ft higher and usually a day’s hike from the cabin. He enjoyed it so much, he went up again the next night. And the next. “I ended up doing it seven nights in a row,” he says. “I don’t know why. I just felt like it.” Sometimes, after running all day, he gets a call telling him someone is in trouble on the mountain and he has to head out again to find them. Does he skip training when that happens? “No.” He grins. “I think of it as bonus training. When I first got the job as mountain rescue, I was like, ‘Whoa, my running is actually useful!’” After breakfast, he invites me to join him on a gentle run. I’m an occasional mid-pack ultrarunner, so I’m nervous about keeping up, but he assures me he’s taking things easy this week, after stumbling on the trail and twisting his back. We set off heading downhill, off the snow and into the pine forests. He chats as we go and I trip along happily behind him, catching glimpses of the surrounding peaks through the trees. The farther we descend, however, the more worried I get. It’s going to be a long slog back up. Sure enough, at the first minor incline, Miller is gone. He waits for me at the top of the hill, but eventually, I have to cut him free. We’ve run a couple of miles. “You go on,” I say. “I’ll follow the trail straight back up from here.” Keen to run at his usual pace, he doesn’t argue and, with a quick nod, he’s gone, scarpering off into the trees, leaving me to walk the last mile back to the camp. Life up on Pikes Peak is a long way from Miller’s early ultra training. After graduating from college, where he ran track and cross-country, he got a job working in the print shop of a cruise ship, theQueen Mary 2. Most runners would probably consider their training days over if they got a job like that, but Miller made it work. “I could write the book on how to stay in shape on a cruise ship.” Whenever the ship was docked, he would go out and run. “We’d go to Chile, Patagonia, and I’d just go and run in the mountains. Wherever we were, I’d look around for the tallest thing or the coolest mountain, and try to run to the top and back before the ship left. Sometimes, I had to run really fast to get back in time. If you miss the ship, you have to get yourself to the next port – then, when you get there, you may or may not have your job any more.” He never missed it. On sea days, the best place to run was up and down the crew stairwells. After an hour or so running up and down stairs, he’d go to the gym to run on the treadmill. “My co-workers thought I was half-crazy. They’d be in the bar, usually drunk, yelling at me to stop running.” It was during a break from the ship that he entered his first ultra race, a 50-mile run in Maryland, theJFK 50.“My family thought I was crazy. My grandmother thought I was going to die or something. And I didn’t know what I was doing.” Halfway through the race, he found himself running at the front with another guy. “I said, ‘My name’s Zach. What’s your name?’ And he said, ‘Rob.’ I said, ‘Rob who?’ He said: ‘Rob Krar.’” At the time, Krar was one of the biggest names in ultrarunning, having just won theWestern States 100, the biggest ultra race in the US. Miller felt like an idiot. “I mean, I didn’t know much about ultrarunning, but I knew who Rob Krar was.” They ran together until mile 38, when Miller started to pull ahead. “At the next aid station, when I arrived ahead of Rob, everyone went crazy, pulling out their phones, trying to figure out who I was. But there wasn’t really anything to figure out. I had been a college runner, but I wasn’t that good. I mean, I ran 31:23 for 10K, which is pretty mediocre. So they asked my friend, ‘What’s his marathon PR [personal record]?’ And he told them I hadn’t run a marathon.” He won, running the third fastest time in the history of the oldest ultra race in the US. “It was pretty fast, considering I didn’t know what I was doing,” Miller says. “That’s when I got signed by Nike.” He was 24. “I’d always dreamed of being a pro-runner,” he adds, “and it happened – just not the way I expected it to.” For a long time, ultra and mountain running was on the far fringes of the sporting world, but recent years have seen a huge expansion in events, participation and people following the sport. As a result, faster and younger athletes are taking it up. “The course records tell the story,” Miller says. “Times people thought were untouchable are being broken by big chunks.” Legendary ultrarunnerDean Karnazes, who has been active for 25 years, says he has also noticed the difference: “The biggest change is the number of really fast, young guys.” The increased competition has led to a rise in sponsorship money. After three years with Nike, Miller has just signed a bigger contract with North Face. “Five years ago, if you told someone you were a trail runner with an agent, they’d have laughed at you,” he says. For the first time, he doesn’t need to work, apart from his running, but he loves Barr Camp so much, he plans to stay as caretaker for the foreseeable future. The evening after our run, Pikes Peak is hit by a huge snowstorm that leaves a fresh 4ft of snow over the mountain. Miller is a bundle of excitement at breakfast the next morning, bristling to get out. “Running is the closest we can get to flying,” he says. “Someone else said that, but I like it. For a brief moment, you’re off the ground. And when you run as far as I do, you get lots of moments like that.” Commenting on this piece?

"'So, how far is it again?' – How to organise a marathon","Andy Palmer of multiple-award-winning races organisers White Star Running answers your questions, from how to set up a race to how to divert errant bulls My name is Andy Palmer and I ownWhite Star Running. We organise trail events, from one-mile kids’ races up to marathons and beyond. These are some of the questions we are often asked. How do we plan a new race?A marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards. Well, road marathons are that distance, as most are officially measured. But if you organise a trail race, things become a bit more flexible. That exact distance is very difficult to achieve if you are running over rights of way, national trails, hills, mountains paths, through streams, over stiles and around the beautiful British countryside. Generally, the off-road world happily accepts that trail running isn’t an exact science, and trusts race organisers to be close enough. However, woe betide the race that comes upbelowthe 26.2-mile distance – people want over, not under. More miles for your entry fee is a good thing. We tend to use the term “ish” for our race: 26.2-miles-ish, half marathon-ish. It’s a get-out-of-jail-free card when the “marathon” is an extra mile or two. How do you decide where to start?The first, and the most mundane, thing we have to consider when route planning is, “Have we got enough parking for all the runners?” That’s before we look at any routes. Then we need a decent area for the start/finish, safe routes in and out of the area, access to water, shelter – and dozens of other things. All races need a good base camp. So once we have a base, we get the Ordnance Survey maps out and the fun really starts. We look for major roads that we need to avoid, safe routes to run and whether we need to cross private land. We ask ourselves, “Would we want to run here?” Dorset and Wiltshire are smashing; it’s a good bet that it’s going to be scenic, and nice views are a really good selling point. Once we have an idea of a race route and a good HQ, we ask the all-important questions: “How far do we want to run?” “Are we creating a marathon or ultra marathon?” “Can we create a half or 10k or 10-mile race?” ‘Can we set up aid stations easily?” “Can the ambulances and medics get to people?” So, now we have the kernel of a race route. Next we ask, “What time of year?” We hold a lot of races in the summer and it’s back to that mundane issue again: parking. Finding hard standing in the countryside for 1,000 cars is difficult in January. We are lucky that the races we do hold in winter – atLarmer Tree Gardensin Wiltshire andthe Tank Museum, in Bovington, Dorset – have access to dry parking. How do you measure the routes and mark them?With all that in place, we then need to get out and check the routes. We have walked and run our race routes many times, and have seen many parts of the country only a hardened rambler would see. We then measure them, mainly with GPS watches and online mapping. We create a race plan with directional signage (a wooden stake in the ground and arrow pointing, hopefully, in the right direction). Our trail races tend not to have mile markers, as they are hard to lay out; one person’s mile five is frequently someone else’s 5.3 or 4.8. We go on foot to lay out the signage – this can take days. The Larmer races, for example, take two teams three days to signpost. How do you work out the logistics for each runner?We position aid stations approximately four miles apart. We use clean water containers and recyclable plastic cups instead of bottles, to cut down on waste. As a rule of thumb, we have three cups of water for each runner; on a hot day maybe more; our water containers hold 75 cups of water. For a race of 500 runners, we would need 10 20-litre water containers for every aid station. With five to seven aid stations, that’s a lot of water to move. During the Giants Head marathon last year we used 1,200 litres of water, 9kg jelly babies, 6kg of jelly beans, 1,500 gels, 100 litres of flat cola, 4 bottles of homemade blackberry vodka, 12 giant watermelons, four dozen oranges, 66 pints of our local brewery’s beer, 66 pints of Dorset cider, 13 family-size packs of pretzels, nine giant packs of crisps, 63 packs of Jaffa Cakes and 600 portions of cake. What are the obstacles?It’s not easy running in the countryside. We work with the farming community and try to fit our races in with them. At a race this year, a concerned farmer rang me up at 6am: “Morning Andy. Dave has escaped; we are dealing with it.” Dave is a massive British White bull. A herd of cows had decided to escape from their field, and seeing them walk past his field, Dave decided to join them by demolishing a barbed-wire fence. Unfortunately, Dave and his harem were now at mile 19 of our race, and the first runners were due to arrive at 10.30am. They managed to tempt Dave out of the field at 10.15am. At the Larmer races last year, a tree fell down on the race route. Time for a quick Plan B; we frantically re-routed before the farmer who owned the land called to tell us he had shifted the tree out of the way for us. So it was back on to the re-routed bit– back to Plan A. We re-routed the Ox half marathon and found a hill we called MOAH – the Mother of All Hills. MOAH is so steep that even the sheep walk around it. We made 400 runners go up it. They thanked us … sort of. When I wrote the race instructions for the Bovington races, which takes place on tank-training ground, I had to tell the runners not to pick up anything that looked as if it could explode … And on the first year of the Ox races, we had to re-route the ultra marathon the day before the race, as flooding had created puddles 100ft long and 4ft deep. We have to delay the start of the Invader races every year because everyone want to take photos of themselves dressed as Romans. Trail running is great."
Why do we run until it hurts? Researchers might have some answers,"During the Ultra Gobi in 2016, I felt more aware of my own body as it gradually disintegrated. According to scientists, this might be partly why I enjoyed it Why would anyone want to run 400km across a desert? It’s a good question and one that I confronted last yearwhen I completed the Ultra Gobi, a single stage, self-navigated 250-mile footrace in China. This year I face an even harder question: Why would anyone do it again? In moderation, running improves both your health and physique; in extremes, it does quite the opposite. The feet blister and swell to the point where multiple pairs of shoes in ascending sizes are required. Toenails turn black and fall off or, worse, fill with fluid and require puncturing. Some runners even choose to strike pre-emptively and have theirs surgically removed. Stress fractures are customary. Tendons rub and become enflamed, sending shooting pains up the leg with each agonising step. Muscles seize up, cramp unpredictably and eventually wither away, leaving a gaunt and haggard appearance. Clothing and pack straps rub the skin raw and bloody. The stomach often ceases to function, leading to vomiting or diarrhoea – a serious issue when one needs to drink 10 litres of water and eat upwards of 6,000 calories each day. But the greatest effect is less visible: the mind, addled by lack of sleep and constant battles with the body, begins to lose its grip on reality. Hallucinations are common. Emotions can oscillate from elation to anger to melancholy in rapid succession. Speech becomes slurred; planning, rational decisions and accurate navigation almost impossible. It is not, by any conventional definition, pleasurable. So, why then, are increasingly numbers of people paying good money to put themselves through it? Fortunately, this is a question that academics at the University of Cardiff have sought to tackle. Published in theJournal of Consumer Research,their research confronts the seeming conundrum that, on one hand, consumers spend billions of dollars every year to alleviate different kinds of pain, while, on the other, millions of individuals participate in extremely painful leisure pursuits. The paper’s title,Selling Pain to the Saturated Self, implies a key premise: that, unlike many sports and activities, where pain is a risk to which participants are prepared to subject themselves, in endurance sport pain is a core part of the appeal. Even a brief conversation with most ultrarunners is enough to confirm this. Races are reverentially described as “brutal” and “savage”, and suffering is discussed with gleeful awe. Similarly, the marketing of many races highlights the opportunities for pain that they are, in effect, selling. Although the research study technically focuses on assault-course racing (the lead researches using her body “as a tool for inquiry and knowledge creation”) rather than ultramarathons, the three leading motivations they uncover are equally transferable. Firstly, pain makes us more aware of our own bodies – or, in the study’s terms, enables us “to rediscover our corporeality…through sensory intensification”. In a world where our bodies have largely ceased to be useful tools for survival and instead merely act as receptacles, it is perhaps little surprise that some form of disconnect has arisen. For the frustrated, sedentary office worker, sensory intensification – be it through self-inflicted pain or stimulatory drugs – presents an opportunity to bridge this dualistic divide. In the Gobi desert in 2016 I certainly felt much more aware of my own body as it gradually disintegrated. It follows that the popularity of ultramarathons is closely linked to the comfort of modern life. Try explaining to people whose lives are physically uncomfortable by necessity that you run in circles for pleasure, and you receive a blank look of confusion.Chinameanwhile, with its exploding middle class, is witnessing and unprecedented growth in endurance running. Secondly, there is a degree of mental escapism. As the authors, somewhat morosely, put it, “by flooding the consciousness with gnawing unpleasantness, pain provides a temporary relief from the burdens of self-awareness”. Escaping from self-awareness would appear to be a common characteristic of the human condition. Alcohol tends to be our society’s favoured fix, althoughbinge-eating, antidepressants and ultimately suicide are also associated problems. In this context, ultramarathons begin to look quite benign. It also helps to explain the abundance of recovered addicts and depressives in the sport, many of whom, asdiscussed by the famous American runner Nikki Kimball, use running as a form of therapy. And there are many others, myself included, who fear that without ultrarunning they might have been more susceptible to other, more damaging, forms of escapism. Finally, the authors assess the role that painful experiences play in retrospect. Pain helps people “craft the narrative of a fulfilled life through wounds and scars”. As a runner and occasional writer, that statement is as depressing as it is true. Samuel Johnson once said that “every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier”.Ultrarunningcan provide ideal faux-battle wounds to remedy that feeling. Some runners even motivate themselves during races by pretending to be fleeing the Gestapo, or the Burmese military, or another genocidal enemy. In reality, ultramarathons are lonely, arduous and largely uneventful. As a spectator sport they are marginally better than England football friendlies, but not quite as good as Jenga. And yet, through social media and blogs, they are dramatised into heroic struggles and atheist pilgrimages, a transformation that is reinforced by the well-intentioned, if misguided, puritanical attitude that perseverance is, by its very nature, worthy. Overall, the paper presents a somewhat bleak but probably quite accurate assessment. I’m left not entirely sure whether my return to the Gobi is an attempt to escape the futility of existence or to find purpose through pain, to discover or forget, a therapy or a drug, self-harm or self-help … or all the above. I am, however, thoroughly looking forward to it. You can follow the progress of theUltra Gobi from 27 September hereand on Instagram@jogonalfie"
Extreme kit testing: which gear is best for 24 hours of non-stop running?,"Running round and round in circles for a full day and night? The things Adharanand Finn will do in the service of the running blog ... The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. Many years ago, I worked as a writer for Which? magazine, and often had to visit its testing laboratory in Milton Keynes. Without giving away any secrets, they test things vigorously at Which?. There were rooms for overheating microwave ovens until they exploded. There were sound labs peopled with experts sitting with their eyes closed. They had a bumpy treadmill-type thing for testing baby buggies to see how they performed over hundreds of miles. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. I thought of all this when I signed up, in a moment of madness, to theSelf Transcendence 24-hour track race in Tooting. I would be a human guinea pig, I thought, running around in circles for hundreds of laps, testing out running products to see if they could really stand the heat. This was Which? magazine-level product testing.Like the Duracell bunny, I could be the ultimate kit tester, for a day. So, how did it go? I started out dressed head to ankle in Inov8. Rain was forecast, so I had on theInov8 Stormshell jacket. Over the first seven hours or so, we got frequent heavy showers, interspersed with bright sun. The jacket kept me completely dry, and was a joy to run in. It’s very lightweight and breathable, so I didn’t overheat in the slightest, and the hood was easy to pull up and down and comfortable to wear both ways. I actually enjoyed the rain spells, running with my hood up and peering out snug and dry, as though I was in my own portable tent. I had planned to change to different shorts and leggings during the race, but as the day/night/next day wore on, the thought of needlessly getting changed was too tiring to contemplate. This Duracell bunny started running very low on juice after about 12 hours and so only the most vital kit was tested ... which in itself was part of the test, I guess. Luckily, theInov8 shortsI started in were so comfortable that I didn’t feel any need to change them. They were lightweight and didn’t cause any problems of the chaffing variety. The only slight issue, if I’m being finicky, was the back pocket could have been a tiny bit bigger. My phone is quite small, but it was a squeeze to get it in. Anyone hoping to carry around a bigger phone, such as the more recent iPhones, may struggle. And why did I need my phone? For music. I don’t usually run to music, but I thought for a 24-hour race on the track, it might help pass the time. People had suggested it could get boring out there running in circles for 24 hours. In the event, it was many things, but it was never boring. After a few hours, every lap was a journey in itself, an epic challenge to be overcome, and music was mostly a distraction. I did have two periods of the race when I felt like listening to music, which was good, as I had brought along two wireless headphones to try out. ThePlantronics Backbeat FITwere comfortable to wear, lightweight and have amazing sound quality. They promised six hours of playtime fully charged, which was plenty for my needs. However, I may be the world’s dumbest headphone user, because I found it difficult to turn them on. I seemed to have to press and hold down the on-button about five times before it worked. And occasionally the tracks would skip if I bumped my phone. Later on in the night, I switched to theBose SoundSport Pulse. These had none of the skipping problems, and the sound quality was also excellent. Rather than hook over your ear, though, these fit by burrowing in. I’ve never been a fan of this type of headphones as I always feel like they are about to fall out. However, despite my concerns and my movement (I’m not sure I could quite call it “running” by this stage), they stayed in place throughout. Socks can make a big difference on a long run, so I can happily report back that the two pairs I tried, fromLululemonandInov8, were light, snug and comfortable throughout. They did a 12-hour shift each with no problems, no blisters, no rubbing, which I would say is highly commendable. Of course, on a long run, the vital piece of kit is the shoes. I brought three pairs along with me with the plan to change them occasionally so my feet weren’t spending 24-hours running on the same surface in the same shape shoe. I started with my favourite running shoe of the moment,the Brooks Hyperion. I use these to train in and love the lightweight feel. They also seem to have a nice, soft touch on the ground, even when you are running on the road. Some shoes seem to make a sharp slapping sound when you run, which always make me feel like I’m doing it wrong. But in these I feel light and smooth. Of course, being racing flats, these aren’t really designed to be worn for more than a few hours, so I knew that, after a while, I would need to switch to something with a bit more cushioning. Next up were theNike Air Zoom Pegasus 34. These are a classic shoe and I felt as though I was stepping into a tried and tested product when I pulled them on, like when you get into an expensive car and everything feels comfortable and sleek. The shoes felt plush, and they looked good, too (I had the fetching pale blue edition). “Almost good enough to eat,” one of my fellow runners commented as he went by, eyeing them admiringly. But these, too, are not designed to be run in for ever. I managed four hours before my feet were ready for the final pair. If any of the kit I tested was actually designed for such a race, it was theHoka Clayton 2. I’ve always been a minimalist runner at heart, but I’ve done a few ultras recently, and I always end up with sore feet, looking jealously at those people bouncing along in Hokas. So, I thought I would give them a try. As well as the ample cushioning – which six hours into the race, I was very happy with – they also had space for my swelling feet to expand into. I did get a pair half a size too big, which helped, but they are intentionally wide with a big toebox to allow your feet to expand on landing as they will naturally want to do. Four hours later, I tried switching back to the other shoes for a bit, but I soon realised that, after 12 hours running, there was only one pair of shoes I could wear and that was the Hokas. So they quickly came back on and stayed on until the end. At which point I collapsed in a heap on the ground, my batteries well and truly drained."
How was your weekend running?,"135 miles, but with sleeps in between stages - how hard could it be? Come share your tales of weekend runs, whether they were round Mont Blanc or round your local park In ultra running, ridiculous numbers are bandied about so much - 100 kilometers, 24 hours,3,100 miles- that it’s easy to get blasé and begin to think it’s all possible and reasonable and sane. If other people can do it, surely you can too, right? So when I signed up for theRing O Fire, a three-day race around the entire coastal path of Anglesey, I saw it as a tough but manageable challenge. I mean,the UTMB was on this weekend. That’s 104 miles, in the Alps, in one go. This was just 135 miles around a reasonably flat island in Wales, with sleeps in between. No problem. So I started the race on Friday afternoon full of the joys of late summer, chasing runners around beautiful coves in isolated stretches of northern Anglesey. The coast path follows the cliff tops, across beaches, around estuaries and along quiet roads past antique fish and chip shops. But by nightfall, as the 100 or so runners bedded down in a leisure centre gymnasium in Amlwch, it was already starting to resemble a war scene, with the wounded being bandaged, guys writhing with cramps, the pungent smell of mud, sweat ... and fear. For in a few short hours, at 5am, we had to be up again ready to tackle the long day - all 66 miles of it. At 4:50am the gym strip lights buzzed on and Quentin, the race director, walked through the rows of bodies, playing the race theme tune, Jonny Cash’s Ring O Fire. Oh hell, even standing up was tough, with the aches and pains. Setting out on such a long run with already battered legs suddenly didn’t seem so manageable - it seemed insane. Without going into too much detail, lets just say that by the end of 15 difficult hours running, I got to the village hall at the finish in Aberffraw that night in a dark place. I don’t know, even now, if I was hallucinating, but something around me was popping incessantly, as I crawled into a ball inside my sleeping bag and attempted to cry myself to sleep. It didn’t work - my legs, hips, feet, everything ached too much for sleep. And most of the other runners were still out there in the dark, scrabbling around looking for barely marked trails in the woods. And the biggest insanity of all? In a few short hours - again at 5am to the wakeup call of Jonny Cash - we had to haul these broken bodies out into the now driving rain, for another 51km run. So, what did you do this weekend?"
I'm running the world's biggest trail race. I just hope it gives me a new screensaver,"This year’s Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc has the strongest line-up ever assembled for a trail ultramarathon – a visceral adventure of rawness and vulnerability I used to change the screensavers on my laptop and smartphone every month or so. But I have had the same picture on both for almost exactly a year now. It is the photo above of my kids meeting me in Chamonix, France, in the final few metres of 2016’s 105-mileUltra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB). After the birth of said children, and that time Danny Dyer put the phone down on me, it felt like the greatest moment of my life. I only placed 19th, yet the generous crowds treated me like I’d won the thing. The surge of euphoria was huge. The chronic soreness in my legs temporarily erased. My kids didn’t know or care how well I’d done, they just thought the whole thing hilarious. And soon went back to calling my Pooh Head. The UTMB is the Tour de France of trail, ultra and mountain running. There are tougher 100-mile races, and wilder, more technical courses. But this is the big one; the world’s most popular and prestigious trail race. Around 2,300 people from over 90 countries – nearly 1,000 of whom won’t complete the circuit around Mont Blanc which nips into Italy and Switzerland. On top of the distance, the 10,300-metre of ascent – and more painfully, the descent – make it the equivalent of 10 Snowdons (or 14 times via the popular but shorter Pyg and Minerss tracks). And never before in trail-ultramarathon running has there been a field as stacked as 2017’s UTMB. A Frenchman has won for the men’s race for the last five years, but the sport’s biggest star and three-time winner,Spaniard Kíllian Jornet(remember that guy who ran up Everest twice in a week? Oh and then won the notorious Hardrock Hundred despite dislocating his shoulder at mile 13), is returning for the first time since 2011. Frenchmen François D’Haene and Xavier Thévenard have both won UTMB, twice, and both return. To see those three pitched against each other in a race known for its kamikaze-fast starts and, not coincidentally, high DNF rate amongst elites, is enthralling enough. But the race’s perennial subplot is that despite having many of the sport’s biggest stars, no US athlete has ever won the men’s race. If UTMB was decided on Strava uploads or self-flamed pre-race hype, American Jim Walmsley would win it. The only runner with a higher ITRA (International TrailRunningAssociation) ranking than Jornet is highly talented. But 100-mile races require a unique skill set, and in his two to date he hasn’t shown he understands that. The deservedly popular Zach Miller – similarly fast and furious – returns, having lead the race for much of 2016 before fading (he’s also won UTMB’s little sister race, the 63-mile CCC). Simply to watch these two race each other has fans’ mouths watering. Yet the Americans who’ve raced UTMB the smartest are David Laney (3rd in 2015, 4th in 2016), Tim Tollefson (3rd in 2016; 2nd at CCC in 2015) and Jason Schlarb (4th in 2014), who all return. Jeff Browning, too, is a textbook 100-mile runner. Other European favourites include Lithuanian Gediminas Grinius (2nd in 2016), Spain’s Tòfol Castanyer (2nd in 2014), Miguel Heras (2nd in 2013) and Pau Capell (several Ultra-Trail World Tour wins) and Norway’s Diderik Hermann. British hopes lie with France-based Andy Symonds, who won the Lavaredo Ultra Trail in 2016 and has hardly raced this year to prepare fully for UTMB after a DNF last year. Other Brits to keep an eye on are Kim Collison, Casey Morgan and Danny Kendall. But Brits are disadvantaged. It’s tricky to train for the Alps’ quad-hammering 1,000m ascents and descents in the UK. The heat, altitude and too much French cheese can also trouble les rosbif. Jez Bragg won a shortened version (due to severe weather) in 2010, but otherwise US-based Ryan Smith has posted the best British performance on the full course, placing eighth in 2015. However, in the women’s race, Derbyshire-based doctor Beth Pascall is a podium contender. The debutante will duel with 2016 winner France’s Caroline Chaverot – who’s won just about every race she’s entered in the last 18 months – compatriot Juliette Blanchet (4th in 2016), Switzerland’s Andrea Huser (2nd in 2016), Spain’s Núria Picas (2nd in 2013 and 2015), Brazil’s Fernanda Maciel (4th in 2010 and 2014) and America’s Magdalena Boulet (5th in 2016), Stephanie Howe Violett (8th in 2015) and Kaci Lickteig. Brits Sophie Grant (10th in 2016), Anna-Marie Watson and Sabrina Verjee could all do well. Despite a huge boom in popularity, trail-ultramarathon running is still a niche activity in Britain. So it’s both exciting and frustrating to see what a huge sport it is just across the Channel. The crowds at UTMB give it a city marathon feel. Cameras are everywhere. Families gather by campfires halfway up mountains ringing cowbells long into the night. Shouts of “Bon courage!” echo around the valleys. In the two previous years, I’ve loved the crowds, the competition and the course, especially the night-time section; bright moonlight bouncing back off the huge white peaks, stars blending with the long zigzag of headaches, the whistle of invisible marmots. My personal fascination is to see how close I – aged 41 (but only five in running years) with two young children and working typical self-employed hours – can get to the professional, full-time runners with sub-2:20 marathons who train regularly in big mountains. I was thrilled to finish in 25 hours and 12 minutes last time, but some issues were holding me back and I think I can do a little better. Even if it simply comes down to how much I’m willing to suffer. Though I know I’ll be cursing the next sentence during the race, I love 100 milers. Above all because, as legendary US runner Ann Trason said, running 100 miles is like living a whole year in one day. I love the visceral adventure, the rawness and vulnerability, the unusual amount of time spent in the present moment, the sense of feeling alive – even if alive can be pretty ouchy. Equally, 100 milers have great potential to deposit you in a puddle of your own tears, vomit and smellier bodily fluids. Either way, I’ll be thinking a lot about that finish line on 1-2 September. Hopefully it’ll provide me with a new screensaver. The UTMB starts at 5pm (GMT) on Friday 1 September and can be followed live athttp://utmbmontblanc.com. Inov-8 Trailroc 285 My Inov-8 Trailtalons were superb last year, but I’m tempted this time to try the new Trailrocs. As well as unrivalled grip on rock and stony terrain, they’re comfortable and deceptively well cushioned, while a gnarly plastic toe-bumper protects me in that ‘kicking rocks seems like a good idea’ phase of the race. Inov-8 waterproofs & race vest Inov8’s new superlightweight (an impressive 108g) Ultrashell waterproof meets UTMB’s strict kit-list rules, while the new Inov-8 Ultrapant waterproof trousers weight just 86g. We must carry leg cover and waterproof leg cover, so I take two pairs of these in my excellent, versatile Inov-8 All-Terrain Pro Vest. Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z Trekking Poles ‘Cheat sticks’ help your legs last longer. While there are lighter and stronger ones, these are the perfect compromise between the two. They’re quick and easy to get out and put away, don’t give my hands issues and wrist straps mean I can eat while using them. Nutrition I love 33Shake’s gels made from all-natural, mostly organic ingredients. CLIF’s caffeinated Shot Bloks keep me ticking over during the night. And when it’s harder to get vital calories in, Mountain Fuel powders go down well. Petzl MYO The MYO isn’t Petzl’s newest or brightest torch, but it’s a great compromise between lumens (280 – 370 in boost) and weight (168g), while the 26g E-Lite is the perfect back-up (we have to carry two torches) Follow Damian onTwitter,Instagram, or indeedStrava"
The perceived loneliness of the ultra long-distance runner,"Looking for something social and visually stunning? The 100km Race to the Stones could be for you. After all, how hard could running with friends be? Distance running is often looked at as a lonely pursuit, where the closest thing to conversation is the bleeping of a smartwatch. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Having spent the early part of the year training for the Milton Keynes marathon, I was looking for something completely different; something social, relaxed and visually stunning – without a roundabout in sight. Race to the Stonesticked all these boxes. Starting in the Chilterns, the route heads west along the Ridgeway, believed to be “Britain’s oldest road”, before finishing at Avebury stone circle, the largest megalithic stone circle in the world. Runners can choose to complete the 100km distance in one heroic push, or in two 50km efforts, camping overnight at the halfway point in Wantage. For reasons unclear, I went for the first option, convincing my friends Nick and Isaac to join me. We decided we would be “completing not competing”, an approach made necessary by our distinct lack of training. Worryingly, my longest run in preparation for this hilly ultra-marathon was a half-pint half-marathon (13 miles, 13 half pints) around the pancake-flat streets of south London. At least we had the weather on our side. A mild, overcast day with some light drizzle – perfect conditions for ultrarunning. Our tactic was simple: walk the uphills, run the flats and the downhills. We’d start slow and inevitably get slower, but hopefully not so slow as to miss our pre-booked bus in 14 hours’ time. The early part of the route is stunning, taking in the appropriately named Field of Dreams – a bright yellow crop field – and the not-at-all-grim Grim’s Ditch. Moreover, unlike a road marathon, an ultra affords you time to strike up conversation with friends and strangers. After a quick game of Marooned 5 – a twist on Desert Island Discs, in which you name the five tracks you’d like to maroon on a desert island, never to hear again – we began talking with two Israeli runners, one of whom had accidentally left his usual running shoes in his hotel. “That’s the thing about ultras,” he said, cheerfully. “They rarely go to plan.” Stocking up with some hot food at the halfway mark, a quick calculation revealed we’d have to do the second 50km in under eight hours if we were to bus back to Swindon station. Easy, right? Unfortunately, what with ultras rarely going to plan, Isaac had managed to become separated from both his two water bottles and had become seriously dehydrated. An extended stop at the 70km aid station was required, while Isaac rehydrated and Nick and I attempted to eat our own body weight in bananas and watermelons. With the clock ticking, we arrived at the 80km mark to be met by a volunteer who cheerily told us there were “only four parkruns to go”. With two-and-a-half hours left before our bus departed, you might think such news was met with relief. However, with our current speed roughly that of an arthritic tortoise, it instead confirmed that we’d have to get a move on if we were to avoid being stuck overnight in Avebury. Yet, even in these testing moments, there’s the sense you’re in it together. Perhaps it’s a result of the preposterously long distance, or the fact that PBs are of concern only to the very front of the field, but the atmosphere here was one of friendliness and support. Even so, those final “four parkruns” were agony. In today’s hotly contested game of ‘My Sorest Part’, my right hamstring was now just edging it from my left shin, and the finish line couldn’t come quick enough. Finally, thrillingly, Avebury stone circle came into view. Alas, Race to the Stones should really be rechristened ‘Race Beyond the Stones’, as exhausted runners then have to about-turn and head another kilometre to the finish. Rubbing one of the ancient boulders for strength, I shuffled onwards, crossing the finish line in a tad over 13 hours, with Nick and Isaac close behind. Our preparation had been poor, our fitness questionable, but we’d done it. In doing so, a number of discoveries had been made. Firstly, 100Km is a long, long way to run. Secondly, the Ridgeway is one of Britain’s best-looking paths. And finally, ultramarathons – far from being lonely pursuits – are great places to form and cement some long-distance friendships.

Taking on the dragon: the toughest five day mountain running race in the world,"Ceri Rees explains the history and terrain of the Dragons Back race – and what you need to tackle it The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. The Dragons Back is a 315k mountain run which has already attracted legendary status as the beast of all endurance events. Unlike many events of this type, that reputation that is fully justified. It was first held in 1992, when Martin Stone and Helen Diamantedes completed the 16,000m of ascent from Conwy Castle to Carreg Cennen Castle. Only 15 pairs and six solo runners followed them across the line at the end of the five days. The race was revived in 2012. In 2015 only 65 people finished the race. This is strictly forseriousendurance athletes. Or so I thought, until a series of group recces acquainted me with a handful of fellow ‘dragons’. We come from all walks of life and fit in training around family and work. There is one thing we all share however, which is the sense of awe we have for the challenge we have taken on. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. It can be a ruthlessly exposing event, challenging your self sufficiency and navigation skills to the max, quite apart from the physical endeavour. No assistance is allowed along the route or at the evening base camp and you can even be disqualified for sneaking a roll in to your bag from the catering van. I began my training with early morning 90 minute runs in the dead of a Dartmoor winter. At the end of a 20 mile bog run, I questioned how I was going to double this distance, add on an extra 3,000m of ascent per day and repeat five times over. Whenever work or family life has permitted it, our merry band has met up. Since February, those of us lucky enough to live in the UK but not in close proximity to the Welsh mountains, have been journeying up or down the M5 corridor to knock off chunks of each leg. GPX downloads, shoe changes, foot hygiene and cake have become regular topics of conversation on the official Facebook page. My navigation and packing skills have improved considerably. Perhaps the biggest scale on the spine of the Dragon’s Back is getting your head around the sheer volume of ascent and mileage every day. Day one alone includes 3,800m of ascent. Thankfully the organisers, Ourea Events, have left no stone unturned. Their checkpoints, often placed on mountain summits by trig points or cairns, are intended to be logical waymarks rather than complicated puzzles. Unlike the first participants, most of us will be wearing GPS devices, strapped to our wrists like invisible shields. The early stages are defined by their technical difficulty and rocky descents, while Day 3 to 5 involve vast horizons which stretch out in front of you as vast tussocky planes, making the several checkpoints on each stage quite possible to miss. Overshoot one and you have to retrace your steps or get disqualified. No mercy will be shown by the race organisers. A challenge such as this involves bringing someone else along with you, whether you like it or not. Our nearest and dearest have to suffer the weekends away on recces, and ‘another’ box of shoes arriving. Kit, kit and more kit. For one of the cheapest sports around, there certainly seems to be a lot of it for this odyssey. These feet have already been through two pairs of shoes on successive recce weekends. We’ve all got our own dragons to slay. One friend is doing it to raise money for a cancer charity because his wife has second stage cancer. Another recently split with his wife and doesn’t want to sit around moping. Another was eliminated on Day three in the 2015 event after missing the cut off. He has the lame excuse of having an artificial hip. I decided early on that I needed another form of motivation, so made the decision to raise money forMind. I feel privileged to have an opportunity to share such a life enhancing journey, with super motivated and determined characters. Whether we make it or not, collectively and as individuals, we are a tiny bit closer to becoming dragon slayers. Good shoes:The most crucial of all the kit. I have chosen theINOV-8 X-Talons 212for their grip and responsiveness and will be inserting my own fleece insoles for extra comfort. While the Inov8 Terraclaw will provide a bit of extra cushioning for the tarmac stretches and trails in the latter half of the week. A running backpack:Packs need to be durable, capable of storing enough food and water and other mandatory kit, which includes taped seemed over layers, the five day bespoke map, a compass and survival blanket. I’m using theUltimate Direction PB 3.0, which is lightweight and surprisingly roomy. A reliable GPS watch with enough battery life to last multiple 10 to 14 hour days:A popular choice is theSuunto Ambit(I use the Peak) and theGarmin Fenix, which both have excellent navigation features for following routes. An accurate altimeter and the ability to display checkpoints are essential features. A mastery of the software is also a pre requisite. Several pairs of comfortable socks:Since it is British terrain our feet will be dealing with, I’ve gone British and will be wearingSock Mine’s very comfortable fell socks. A good blister kit:The organisers do bespoke supplies. Poles:These are optional but Black Diamond (z pole) Mountain Kings are the ones I would choose. Ceri is raising money for MIND.

"Dean Karnazes: 'When you’re struggling, that’s when you feel most alive'","In his latest book, the ultramarathoner takes on the ancient Greek 153-mile Spartathlon. He talks about the magic in misery and why he has stopped stoking up on pizza Hi Dean. You have a new book out,The Road to Sparta. What is it about?It is the story and the lore of the marathon, from its genesis in ancient Greece 2,500 years ago to the modernmarathon. It’s how the marathon became the marathon. And in the book you take on the Spartathlon race [a 153-mile race from Athens to Sparta] in Greece, right?Well, what I learned in researching the marathon is that there’s more to the story than a lot of us thought, and it goes beyond 26.2 miles into an ultramarathon.Pheidippideswas recruited to run from Athens to Sparta to recruit the Spartans for battle. He was actually a professional runner, they were calledhemerodrome,which meant “day-long runner”. The Athenians realised that an elite ultrarunner could outrun a horse; they could essentially dispatch men quicker than horses if needed. So the Spartathlon is the modern-day version of that journey. As anultrarunnerwith Greek heritage, you must feel a strong connection with this story?Very much so. My dad used to always say that we’re from the same village as Pheidippides. If you go to the village where my father’s from, everyone looks alike. You’ve run hundreds of ultramarathons in all seven continents – how did the experience of running in Greece compare?It was a different sort of experience in that I’m a modern-day ultramarathoner. I have all the kit, I’m eating gel packs, hydration fluids and everything … but in this race I tried to recreate what Pheidippides did 2,500 years ago, running in leather sandals, eating figs and olives and cured meat … I mean, they were a tougher breed back then. What I found when I was running for 24 hours eating only figs, let’s say I had some GI issues, my bowels kind of shut down, so I really couldn’t eat anything for the last half of the race … only water for 75 miles. I mean, he died at the end of his run, and I can see how it could kill you. There was a point when I was maybe 120 miles into the race, I was extremely dehydrated, my electrolytes were out of balance, and as I was running along I saw what appeared to be a grasshopper, or a praying mantis, a little stick figure in between my feet moving along as I was running. And I was looking down at this thing, trying to make sense of it, trying not to step on it … and then I realised, it dawned on me … that’s me! It was as though I was in a helicopter or a hot-air balloon. So I think I had an out-of-body experience. I’ve never had anything like that happen to me before and I thought, maybe this is how you feel right before you die. Your books have inspired a lot of people to take up ultrarunning. Is this a good thing?I’ve been conflicted about this a little bit. There’s a race called the Western States 100 that’s in my first book,Ultramarathon Man, and there’s a lottery to get in. You used to have a 50-50 chance, but now there’s 15 applications for each entry, so it’s almost impossible to get in and people blame me, they say: “You told the world about ultramarathoning, and now everyone’s getting into it.” I respect that, but I think it’s something of a myopic point of view because ultrarunning is a noble pursuit and has brought purpose to many people’s lives, as it has mine. I wrote about this in my book and, in a way, that gave permission to other people to try these sorts of things. I think people can identify with my story because it’s every runner’s story, we all feel pain together. This latest book is about a very difficult race of mine. I could have had a good race and it would just be a standard race report, but this is about a guy falling apart, it’s a commonality that unites us. Do you think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy putting yourself through this sort of pain?I think there’s magic in misery, and that’s been lost in western culture. We thought if we took all the pain and struggle out of our lives, we’d be happy, and I think we’re so comfortable, we’re miserable. When you’re struggling, when you look back at that experience, that’s when you feel most alive, and I think people seek that out because life is so mundane now. You’ve done so many races, can you say if one was the hardest of all?The Badwaterultramarathon across Death Valleyis a very challenging race, 135 miles non-stop, over 50C, with a headwind. Do you record your mileage? Do you know how far you’ve run in total?Not really, but for the back of the napkin calculation, probably about 100,000 miles. Do you ever listen to music while you’re running?I listen to audiobooks. I probably have 500 on my playlist. I ran across America one time from LA to New York and I probably listened to 50 books in 75 days of running. What’s the furthest you’ve ever run in one go?I once ran 350 miles in an 81-hour continuous push. What do you like to eat while you’re running?I’ll never live down the story in Ultramarathon Man of ordering a pizza and getting it delivered to the roadside as I ran by. But I don’t eat that sort of food any more. I really likenut butters, I find they sit better with me than gels. I likecoconut waterfor hydration, I find that works well. What’s your favourite place in the world to run?It was London today [we did a loop along the Thames in central London before the interview]. My favourite place is wherever I am that day. But that was a glorious run. To you, it was all normal, but it would be like me taking you for a run across the Golden Gate bridge [near his home in San Francisco]. Do you ever run barefoot?On the beach, or the infield of a track, yes. I love running barefoot, but not on pavements. But I did run a marathon barefoot … I wanted to see what it was like. How was it?It was horrible! My legs were not as sore, amazingly, but my feet were really beat up. Who is your running hero?Probably my dad. I remember going to the inaugural LA marathon [in 1986]. I was just a young boy and I remember he ended up in the medical tent at the finish. He was a mess, he had an IV in his arm, he was shivering, and I looked at him and my first thought was: why would anyone do this, I’m never going to run a marathon, this is the most ridiculous thing. So he influenced me, but not in the way you would think. But something about it must have resonated. The Road to Sparta is published by Allen and Unwin (£12.99).

London marathon: the runners for whom 26.2 miles is not that far,"If you’re an ultra marathon runner, the standard 26.2-mile marathon must be a breeze, right? Well, it depends I have run the London marathon twice before, and I have also stood on the Embankment cheering runners along those last few miles before the finish. For most people taking part, this is a place – the last few miles of a marathon – they have rarely, if ever, visited. It’s etched across their faces in grimaces or manic grins. Each step is a small mountain, the crowds are a blur ... everything is a blur. Yet for a few runners, reaching 23 or 24 miles and pushing on is nothing special. For some, it’s not even that far. When I spoke to the famous ultra-runner Scott Jurek, before he ran the Boston marathon last week,he was hardly nervous about the distance. “I don’t want to say it’s just like brushing my teeth,” he said. “But to run around in 3hr 30min ... I mean, I want to respect the distance, but it feels comfortable. Almost like a warm-up.” Ultra-runner Karl Meltzer wears a T-shirt that says “100 miles is not that far”. Well,for him, it isn’t. He recentlybroke the record for the Appalachian Trailin the US, which is a mere 2,190 miles. After that, 100 miles may well seem short. Twenty-six miles? Pah, it’s barely worth getting changed. I bring all this up because having runa 34-mile ultra race a few months ago, I’m hoping to feel like I’m breezing along in this year in London, come mile 24. That’s how it works, right? Of course, Jurek’s answer contained a little caveat. “To run around in 3:30 …” he said. For one of the world’s best ultra-runners, that’s clearly not full speed ahead. But while running the marathon distance may not be a problem for an ultra-runner, running it fast is still a big challenge.Ali Young, a British international ultra-runner, says: “The London marathon is still a big race. For me, I find it the most intense training. It’s the only distance I have a coach for.” Young says she will line up in Greenwich on Sunday looking for a fast time. “Yes, if was doing a marathon just for fun, it would be an easy task, but I defy anyone to say when ‘racing the marathon’ that it was easy. Just thinking about running 26.2 miles in sub-7 min/mile pace is hard. But that’s always my aim.” It is a perennial grievance of non-ultra runners that people are more impressed if you run theMarathon de Sablesor theSparthalonthan if you run a fast marathon or 10K, even though the commitment, talent and effort required for the latter can be just as demanding – if not more so. Even to run one mile in a fast time is difficult in its own way – more people have climbed Mount Everest than run a mile in under four minutes. Yet the fact remains, that there will be a select few runners on Sunday who won’t be remotely intimidated by the distance. Another is Peter Thompson. Come Sunday, he will be midway throughan epic challenge to run 44 marathons in 44 days– one in each country in Europe (“I’m using the UN definition of Europe,” he says). Thompson says that by running all these marathons he has, oddly, cured himself of his fixation with the marathon. He only started running in 2009 but he was soon obsessively training, running over 100 miles a week, and eventually, he ran a marathon in 2:25. This year, however, he says he will probably run London in “four or five hours”. “But,” he says, “it will be so much more rewarding.” Rather than chasing fast times,he is now running for two mental health charities, a cause that is close to his heart. “My focus is very much on the charity,” he says. “I have had family and friends suffer mental health issues and I have dealt with it in my job, so I really just want to encourage people to talk about it.” This focus on using his running as a way of raising money, and also to travel and experience new things, has improved his relationship with running, he says. He sounds like a recovered addict when he says that, before, it took over his life, that he couldn’t relax in the morning unless he had had his run. “I still have friends who run and when they go to the pub all they talk about are splits, times, mileage. I’m really glad that’s not me any more.” So if you’re struggling along the Embankment and a runner next to you is barely sweating, chatting and generally enjoying himself, it may be Thompson, or some other ultra-runner out for an easy Sunday jaunt around the capital. That is, unless they’re “racing” the marathon."
International women's team take on Marathon des Sables in world first,"Despite hosting the race for 28 years, Morocco still fails to attract female participants – but, this year, a global collective of ultra-runners hopes to change that On 9 April, for the first time ever, an international women’s team will take their places on the start line of Morocco’sMarathon des Sables. The X-Bionic Women’s Team, supported by the charityFree to Run, will compete in the 250km run across the Sahara desert in the hope of inspiring more Moroccan women to take up running. “There aren’t enough female role models in this sport and by coming together as a team we hope to help change that,”saidJenny Davis,team captain and driving force behind the project. Davis will be joined in the desert by two highly talented Moroccan runners, Aziza Raji and Touda Didi. All three are accomplished ultra-marathoners and have been training hard in the Sahara for the six-day race. The Marathon des Sables, or MdS, has long been established as one of the world’s most famous ultra-marathons. Although it might not quite live up to its claim to be “the toughest footrace on earth” (there are other candidatesfor this controversial title), its size and popularity make it a special event, as I discovered when I joined a thousand or so othersshuffling across the desert in 2014. The MdS’s popularity has not been limited to weekend warriors from the UK and France either, although they are by far the two largest participant nationalities. Over the years, it has also become a major national sporting event in its home country of Morocco. The famous Moroccan brothers,Lahcen and Mohamad Ahansal, have achieved national hero status after winning a staggering 15 victories between them. So far, however, MdS has tended to be a heavily male-dominated event and has particularly struggled to attract participation from Moroccan women. In 2016, 15% of the field was female and there were only three Moroccan women out of a total 973 finishers. Admittedly, ultra-marathon participation in general tends to be weighted towards men but in other races the divide is smaller and, in many cases, shrinking further all the time. The difference between the male and female winning times is also notable. Whereas in many long distance and multi-day events one will find a gap of perhaps 10-20% between male and female times on average, for MdS, the differential over the past five years has been more than 30%. There are numerous reasons for this, not least that the race requires runners to carry their kit – which is likely to be heavier in proportion to body weight for women. But the lack of “serious” female runners from Morocco – runners who might be more used to the terrain – is another. Davis and her team are hoping to change this. Recognising that there are cultural and religious taboos surrounding women’s participation in sport, Team X-Bionic hope that their publicity can help to change attitudes and inspire a future generation of runners. Aziza Raji, who is aiming for a podium finish in the race, explained: “These opportunities are rare for women in Morocco. I have noticed remarkable progress in recent years for women’s rights and equality here. Having this women’s team bolsters that progress and I hope I can be considered a role model to other Moroccan women who are considering getting involved in running.” The Free to Run charity, which “uses the power of sports to help women and girls overcome the harmful effects of conflict and discrimination”, has been helping to organise and promote the initiative. Previous examples of their work include setting up sports groups in refugee camps in South Sudan andhelping women to participate in Afghanistan’s first marathon’. Founder Stephanie Case is confident that Team X-Bionic can succeed. “Having seen first hand the positive impact of our programs over the first two years of operation, I am even more convinced of the power of sports to change lives.” You can support the team, and their plans to expand the initiative to races in other countries, atjustgiving.com/fundraising/womensinternationalteamand you will be able to follow their progress in theMarathon des Sables from 9 April, or on Twitter at@XBWomensTeam"
Andrew Murray: 'Training hard and sleeping well are far more important than fancy watches',"The ultramarathoner on running around Outer Mongolia and eating bananas and custard with his two-year-old daughter The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. Hello! What crazy adventure have you been onrecently?At the end of January, I was running in Outer Mongolia,in the Genghis Khan marathon. At -32C, it was even colder than my native Aberdeen. We had what may have been the world’s coldest Burns supper out there. Now I’m back working at the Scottish Running Clinic (University of Edinburgh), for the SportScotland Institute of Sport and golf’s European Tour. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. What’s next?For 2017, I’ll be doing most of my running in the UK, which is great – I love the hills – and will also do the Ryder Cup run with a friend. We’ll start at the home of the European Tour in England and jog over to Pariswhere the next Ryder Cup is being played. We’ll play some golf each day also – some speedgolf, wild golf as well as the more conventional 18 holes. I love running and golf for different reasons – but both are great for health, so we’re keen to promote that. Where’s your favourite place to run?The Isle of Skye in Scotland.Absolutely epic with the mountains all around youand plenty nice ridges to get up on to. Even the bus/drive there is beautiful. Although in the summer, the midgies are the size of golf balls. Do you remember your first race as a school kid?I came third in my school cross-country race. It wasn’t really cross-country but a load of laps of the playground. That qualified me for the school team, but we arrived for the Scottish championships a week late – our teacher had misread the information sheet. When people ask you for a training tip, what do you tell them?Start slowly and build up. This will help avoid injury and get the race finisher’s medal you deserve. Then enter a race you really want to do – I think a focus is really helpful and gets you out the door when it’s raining. Eat decently and sleep at least seven hours. Training is much easier if you’ve had a decent sleep. Do you ever struggle with motivation?Every runner will struggle with motivation at some point. With most races, I’ll try and break them into smaller chunks. Getting to the next checkpoint is a lot less daunting than thinking of the whole race distance. I always leave my alarm clock on the other side of the room, so I have to get out of bed to shut it up. Do you listen to music when you run?Mostly not. Most of the time I’m happy looking around or chatting to friends when I’m running. Sometimes, if I’m training for something long and have to do a 50 miler along a canal or similar, I’ll put some music on to distract myself. Although, the last time, I borrowed my brother’s iPod and he had all sorts of rubbish on there. Do you like a running gadget?My shoes. Currently, it’s usuallyMerrell All-Out Crush.My feet are the tools of the trade so I need to look after them. I’m not really a man for gadgets. I think training hard (and smart), eating right and sleeping well are far more important than fancy watches and the like. The Kenyans tend to do fine without them. I think we’re a bit over-reliant on them in the western world. I will usually take my phone to take some pictures if I’m up in the hills along with decent clothing, map and compass, etc. What’s the worst thing about running?Having to clean rank socks and shoes from a day in the hills. Terrible. What’s the best thing?Seeing stuff. I’m convinced that you see and even smell and hear far more running than in a car or even cycling. It’s a great way of seeing things in the local area and further afield. Also getting regular exercise keeps me happy. I’ve had a couple spells out with injuries and it’s no fun at all. What’s your post-race indulgence?I’ll tend to go all scientific and have some protein (to repair muscles) and carbohydrate (to replace the fuel I’ve used). This might be a chicken sandwich or a baked potato with tuna. But my indulgence is custard and bananas – both myself and my two-year-old daughter love custard and bananas! What do you eat before your big runs or a big race?It depends – for a race I’ll eat about 100g of carbs two hours prior – maybe a couple of bananas or a sandwich. I’ll have carbo-loaded the night before so just a small top up. If it’s a longer challenge of, say, 100 miles, I’ll eat something more substantial. Have you ever run barefoot?I grew up in Kenya, so used to run around barefoot to play football and the like. But actually as soon as Kenyans run in competition, pretty much everyone wears shoes. Lighter shoes offer performance advantage, but no shoes is harder to race with. When I came back to Scotland aged eight, wearing shoes all the time didn’t come naturally, but was definitely needed for the snow. Who would you choose to watch, Mo or Usain?There is something compelling about both of these legends.Usain Bolt for the theatre; Mo Farah for the utter determination and hard work he has put into being the best in his business. Who is your favourite runner?Kílian Jornet is pretty exceptional – this guy thinks it’s normal to run up the Matterhorn. He is the king of ultra-long distance running. Kenenisa Bekele is one guy thatmany of the really fast runners admire. His engine is so big, it’s scary to think what he would have done had he stayed fully fit throughout his career. But, if push comes to shove: my wife, Jennie. She was running marathons before me and finds a way to smile at the finish – which is important I think (especially for the photos). Andrew has run from John O’Groats to the Sahara desert (4,300km); a record seven ultras on seven different continents in under a week; and completed the first run across the Namib desert. He is a sports-and-exercise-medicine doctor with the University of Edinburgh, and a Merrell brand ambassador.Follow him on Twitter@docandrewmurrayor atwww.docandrewmurray.com."
Scott Jurek: 'Being uncomfortable brings us back to our roots',"Ultrarunning legend Jurek on his toughest race, his love of tempeh and why he’s running the Boston marathon You’re a famed ultramarathoner. How come you’re running theBoston marathon?I’m a lover of all distances and I love to jump into marathons. Boston is such a special race, the energy, the people, the history [Boston is the world’s oldest annual marathon]. I usually run guiding a blind runner or helping a friend. It’s my chance to give back. This time I’m running with my wife, Jenny, and the founder ofClif Bar, Gary Erickson. So this isn’t your first Boston marathon?No, it’s my third. The first time I guided a blind runner, Tom Panek, the CEO of the charityGuiding Eyes. It was a special way to experience Boston, seeing it for two people, not only thinking about myself, such as at the hydration stations, but helping someone else. It was an amazing experience. I guess as an ultramarathon runner, completing a marathon is just a short training run, right?Well, I don’t want to say it’s just like brushing my teeth, but to run around in 3hr 30min ... I mean, I want to respect the distance, but it feels comfortable. Almost like a warm-up. I take it you enjoy road races, not just trail races?All events have their own energy and experiences. In many ways I’d rather be running in the mountains, but I love to experience all aspects of running. I notice you haven’t run many competitive ultra races recently. Are your ultrarunning days behind you?Right now I’m not entering as many formal races. I’m more intrigued by exploring my limits. In 2015, I broke the record for the Appalachian trail [a mere 2,189 miles] and I’m lining up something else for later this year. These adventure runs and trail records are what I find most alluring now, at the end of my career. The Appalachian trail record [it took him 46 days, eight hours and seven minutes] was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. You’re tapping into primal instincts of survival.Runningin mountains and woods for that long, you have to be adaptable, almost animalistic. Being uncomfortable like that brings us back to our roots of who we are as humans. You’re famously a vegan. When and why did you become one?In 1999. It wasn’t for performance benefits, but for long-term health. I was reading a lot about what makes a healthy body and I was working in hospitals, seeing what people were eating, and I just decided that that was the best option for me. I was eating a lot of junk food at the time, so I needed to do something radical. Is veganism good for ultrarunning?Being vegan keeps me on track. If I just tried to eat healthy food, but kept eating meat, I don’t think I’d be as focused. Am I faster than another guy because of my diet? Probably not, but it forced me to eat foods I had never eaten, or even heard of before. I was a meat and potatoes guy ... What sort of foods are we talking about?Simple foods, such as brown rice – I hadn’t eaten that before. Quinoa, lentils and beans, these are staples in many parts of the world. It’s not flashy, but by combining grains and legumes you have a perfect protein. Then there’s tempeh, that’s one of my favourite foods. It’s like tofu but has a great nutty flavour, and it’s a dense protein. I’m a big fan of avocados, olive oil, coconut oil; they all form a big part of my diet. You don’t have to be vegan to eat all this stuff, of course. During a race, what do you eat?For a race like Boston, carbs are the most important thing. For a marathon, I tend to stick to sports food – drinks, gels, bars. They’re quick and portable. I remember when gels were a new thing, but now there are all sorts of things, such asClif Bloks, which are a chewy carbohydrate. And I’ve been working with Clif to come up with what we callOrganic Energy Food, which is like real food in a form easy to transport and use during a race. We have a sweet potato flavour, a pizza flavour, things like that. On longer races, people want something that is closer to real food. Over the years, I did a lot of experimenting with what to eat while running, so I’m putting all that experience to good use. What do you think about that other popular dietary trend in ultrarunning, the paleo diet?It’s not a diet for long-term health. People can get results initially, because they’re cutting out sugar and processed foods, butstudies have shown that eating meat in those quantities is not good in the long-term. We’re not the same as we were in the paleolithic era, when people only lived to 30 or 35 years of age. Carbs are not the enemy. Even people who follow the paleo diet will use carbs on race day, because that’s what we need. The brain needs glucose to survive. You’ve done some pretty epic races over the years. Which was your toughest?The 24-hour world championships. It was a one-mile loop that you ran around and around for 24 hours. That was the toughest, both mentally and physically. You’ve run the Badwater [135 miles through Death Valley, in July,in temperatures of 54C] and Hardrock 100 [which he won in 2007]. But this was the toughest?Yes, without a doubt. OK, those other races look tougher on paper, in fact they’re two of the hardest races out there, but the 24-hour race was a different challenge. I call it the PhD of running – no change in scenery, no running from A to B, no finish line. Mentally, it’s a killer. Trail running is mostly walking and running, but this is different. And I was pretty proud of the result – I broke the US record [running 165.7 miles]. Where is your favourite place in the world to run?The Himalayas is probably the most incredible place I’ve ever run. The scale of the mountains there is just mind-boggling. Do you remember your first race?Yes, I was a fourth grader in middle school and I somehow got picked to run a cross-country race for the school. I placed second. I didn’t really like running then, but the excitement and energy was pretty captivating. Do you listen to music when you run?I do when I’m running on the roads, and if I go super-long, such as on the Appalachian trail, then I do at times. But I also love to hear the sounds around me and tap into that, especially if I’m in the mountains. Do you have a favourite gadget?Well, a watch is pretty essential. I never thought I’d say this but on the Appalachian trail, my iPhone was invaluable, for taking pictures, getting in contact with people. I used a mapping app, too. I also love myUltimate Direction running vest. It has pockets, a hydration pack – it’s like a second skin at times. You featured a lot inChris McDougall’s bestselling book Born to Run. Did he convince you to take up barefoot running?The funny thing is I already did barefoot running in the infield and I was already using minimal shoes. This stuff was already around before the book, and I was always a fan of lighter shoes with less support. So, I’m a believer in barefoot and minimal running, yes, but as a tool for building foot strength and honing form. I wouldn’t run a race barefoot. It wouldn’t be efficient on rocky trails. Finally, who is your running hero?Yiannis Kouroshas always been a hero of mine. When you look at the scope of his world records, it’s pretty incredible. In more conventional road and track running, I guess my heroes are probably Steve Prefontaine and Emil Zátopek."

Nicky Spinks: 'I like the silence of running in the outdoors',"Earlier this year, the 49-year-old made fell running history by becoming thefastest person to run a Double Bob Graham Round. What’s the secret of her success? The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. The 49-year-old breast cancer-survivor marked 10 years post-diagnosis by running theDouble Bob Graham Round–132 miles and around 54,000ft of ascent – in a record-breaking time of 45 hours and 30 minutes. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. Where is your favourite place to run?It’s got to be the Peak District, where I live, even though it’s not hilly or very remote. Actually, it’s very accessible – 20 minutes in a car and I’m there with my dogs and I don’t see a soul. There’s a place called Rocking Stones, which is a set of stones that look down the valley towardsLadybower Reservoirand, on a nice day, you can see for miles So you run with your dogs?Yes. I was going to get a lurcher but, when I rang up, the lady said: “Actually Nicky, I know you are a long-distance runner; lurchers don’t like long distance! But I have got a collie cross that would suit you down to the ground.” So I did deliberately get a dog that could run a long way. Did you run as a child?I lived in Glossop on a farm, and I used to run around the farm to get the horses in or to go and see my friend on the neighbouring farm. So I was a good runner, but at Glossop comprehensive we weren’t encouraged all that much. It was more team sports, such as netballl, which I didn’t get on with. Hockey was OK. What’s your top training tip?Get a pair of shoes. OK, so you need some other clothes to run in. Clothes are good! But get a pair of shoes that fit you and are suitable for where you’d like to run. So if you are into road but thinking about off-road, get a pair with a bit of grip so that when you do get off the road you don’t fall on your arse. Do you do much cross training?I didn’t used to, because with farming, it’s really all about upper-body training. But I’ve just been on a fell-running coaching course to teach people, and they were talking aboutplyometrics, so I’ve started doing some of that as well. I think it will make a big difference – core strength and so on. Do you ever listen to the radio or music when you run?No. I like the silence of running in the outdoors or listening to the birds or the wind. Well, I don’t like wind … but I don’t get why people like to run with music, it’s never been something I like to do. Even when I’m driving in the car, I’ll often turn the radio off because it’s annoying me. What’s the best thing about running?Being able to run whatever the weather, whatever the time of day. Enjoying it for different reasons. I’ve just had flu, so I haven’t run for a week. When I went for a run again it felt like I was running on one half of a lung. But just the fact that I could run after missing it for a week – I was noticing different things. It was dark, I was going very, very slowly, just noticing that the moon was out, and the reflection on the road. What’s the worst thing about running?Feeling frustrated when you can’t. That’s probably the thing that your partner will also say is the worst thing! A non-running runner is the worst person to live with. What is your post-run treat?Fish and chips with curry sauce, and a pint of beer. Or a curry. Something spicy. Um, silly question for you, but what’s the furthest you have ever run?Well, 132 miles. But that was a run-walk! How did you fuel that?I had a big selection because I knew at some point I’d go off everything, which I did. So I went round in full circle. I started off with muesli bars, which are quite easy to eat. But then you run out of saliva after six hours or so. Not totally, of course, but the bars feel very dry. So then it was rice pudding, fruit salads, baked beans. Then, after about 18 hours, I struggled with that, so I went back to the muesli bars. You now have the record for the Double Bob Graham Round, and it seems that more and more women are winning ultra races outright. Do you think there’s a point at which the gender balance becomes more equal?I think, off the roads, it’s probably about 20 miles. Thinking about whatJasmin Parishas done – in the Lake District, when fell races are about 20 miles – she’s very near the men. I think she’s got a much more consistent pace. I think there will be more as well. What do you eat on the morning of a long run?Porridge. With sultanas. Sugary. Some honey too. Do you ever run barefoot?No. It’s something that I can see would work, but I don’t know if it’s for me. Do you watch athletics?I coach juniors atPenniston Footpath Runnersand it’s an athletics club, so if athletics is on, I’m fascinated. Athletics is so complicated – all of the long jump, the hurdling. It’s so many different things broken down that they’ve got to do. Coaching juniors, I’m always trying to pick up the perfect form: what it is, how to get the juniors to do it. So watching, even looking at pictures on the wall here [we are talking inThe Running Works cafe], I’m wondering: “Is that perfect form? Triple extension?” For you, who is the greatest ever runner?[long think] I really admireSarah Rowell. She was winning races outright, too. I think she’s a UK Athletics selector now. So not only did she do a lot for running years ago, showing women what women could do, she’s also still in the sport working really hard now. She really pushed boundaries in women’s fell running.

"Ron Hill: Running 19,032 days in a row? Maybe it's time for a day off","Running legend Ron Hill has finally finished an unbroken streak that stretches over half a century This article includes content provided by Facebook. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'. Even the greatest streak must, eventually, end. AndRon Hill has announced that, after 52 years and 39 days, he’s finally going to have a day off. For those not steeped in the history of distance running, Hill, 78, is probably less a running legend than a brand name for somewell-priced kit(though he sold the brand named after him in the early 90s, and now runsHillyclothing). Yet he is undeniably one of the British all-time greats. In his heyday, he set world records at multiple distances (10 miles, 15 miles, 25km) and was the second man to break 2hrs 10min in the marathon (the first being Australian Derek Clayton). He ran in three Olympic games – Tokyo in 1964, Mexico City in 1968 and Munich in 1972. He won the European Championship marathon in 1969. In 1970, he won the Boston marathon – the first British runner to do so – and in July of the same year, won the Commonwealth Games title in Edinburgh. Most athletes would see that as an illustrious career and retire for a slightly easier life – not just from competitive sport, but perhaps even from running itself. Not Hill. Not for another 19,032 days. In a statement to Streak Runners International, Hill explained: “It is with great sadness that I have to report the end of my streak. I have been having heart problems, and have been waiting for some time now to have the problem diagnosed and hopefully rectified. One-mile runs have not helped, and on Saturday 28 January I ran my last one mile. After less than 400m, my heart started to hurt and over the last 800m the problem got worse and worse. I thought I might I die, but just made it to one mile in 16min and 34secs. There was no other option but to stop. I owed that to my wife family and friends plus myself.” Streak Runners Internationalkeeps a tally of all ongoing streaks, from the “neophyte” (who haven’t even made five years yet) through to the Hills – 50 years plus, in honour of Ron himself. Their official definition is a run of at least one mile every calendar day, and tracking streaks is largely a matter of trust – or indeed, honour. After that many years, the question of whether or not it’s entirely healthy, or if the body might need the odd day off, surely becomes moot. When he reached 50 years, Hill told Runner’s World that the most serious threat to his streak up to that point had been when he broke his sternum in a car accident in 1993. Luckily, he had already run that day. Here’s wishing Ron Hill a speedy recovery, even if when he starts again, he’ll be a mere neophyte."
Picture of the day: Britain's most brutal race,"TheMontane Spine Raceis a 268 mile non-stop challenge encompassing the entire Pennine Way. The 2017 race concluded for the frontrunners yesterday with victory for Tom Hollins from Britain. The cut off for runners is 168hrs - Hollins won in 99 hours and change - andwas asleep minutes later. Carol Morgan was the first woman, annihilating the course record by a jaw-dropping 43 hours to finish in 109 hrs. Others are still out on the course - the cut off falls on Sunday at 8.35am."
The 24-hour race: 'It is a battle with your mind',"Ultra-running is one of the fastest growing sports, usually taking place in remote, scenic landscapes. Not a running track in London. Will competitors reach nirvana? ‘Ihallucinated, of course. I always do,” Pat Seabrook says. She is 76 and has spent the past 24 hours running round a 400m athletics track in Tooting, south London. She sits in the front seat of her car, peeling plasters off her toes. “At some point I began to think the white lines on the track were ropes, rising up around me, and I was pushing them away.” She laughs: “Usually I run with my friend and we take turns to hallucinate.” Along with 44 other runners, Seabrook has just competed in theSri Chinmoy Self-Transcendence 24-hour Track Race. Ultra-running, in which competitors take part in races longer than a marathon and often 100 miles or more, is one of the fastest growing sports in the world, with new races launching all the time; the biggest ones have been forced to introduce lottery systems to cope with the numbers who want to enter. But part of the appeal of these races is that they usually take place amid some of the world’s most remote and scenic landscapes, such as the Sahara or the Rockies. Not around a track in Tooting. The winner, James Stewart, runs a mind-boggling 160 miles over the course of the day. It’s hard to grasp, watching him plug away, lap after lap: 160 miles, without going anywhere. He could have run all the way to Cardiff, but he’s still here, on the track in Tooting. Seabrook is the oldest competitor here and covers 83 miles during the race. “It’s not that great,” she says, pulling off another plaster. “Last year I ran 87.” As well as countless 24-hour races, she has also run 456 marathons. She didn’t even start running until her late 40s, when all her children had grown up and left home. “I needed something to keep me busy,” Seabrook says. “What else am I going to do on a Saturday?” Yet in spite of her low-key attitude, something else is going on here. The race was started almost 30 years ago by followers of the late Indian spiritual teacher Sri Chinmoy, who believed that running was integral to a spiritual life. In 1977, Chinmoy started a marathon team, which began putting on races in New York and is now one of the biggest organisers of endurance events around the world. While most of the volunteers and organisers in Tooting are followers of his teachings, only one of the runners, Mahasatya Janczak from Poland, is part of the Sri Chinmoy team. He has done the race twice before. Does he find self-transcendence through it? “At moments, definitely,” he replies, a glint in his eye. “It’s really something. You can only understand it if you try it.” Diana Celeiro has come all the way from Argentina for the race. It’s her second time here. Her husband, Gustavo, acts as her support crew. Most of the runners have someone who stands diligently by the track watching, offering encouragement, preparing snacks or helping with any issues that arise, from blisters to emotional breakdowns. Some of the support crews have brought tents; one family even has a motorhome parked up on the edge of the track. A few of the runners have no crew and have just set up a table on the grass – or, in one runner’s case, an ironing board – laden with their supplies. Some supporters disappear home or to a hotel during the night for some sleep. Gustavo, though, stands vigilant throughout, always smiling. “This is different from running 100 miles in the mountains,” he says. “When you run 100 miles all around a track, it is a battle with your mind.” I ask how his wife is, after completing a race like this. “Very quiet,” he says. “Almost dead.” In Japan, monks on Mount Hieirun 1,000 marathons in 1,000 daysin a effort to reach enlightenment. One of the monks once told me that the idea behind the constant movement is to exhaust the mind, the body, everything, until nothing is left and you are almost dead. “When you are nothing, then something – pop! – comes up to fill the space,” he said, miming a bubble popping. That something, he told me, is the vast consciousness that lies below the surface of our lives – a sense of oneness with the universe. None of the runners here in Tooting vocalises it quite so lucidly, but there are glimpses of something deeper than PBs and course records. “Sometimes, you can get into that space; a few laps go by and you don’t realise it,” Paul Corderoy says. “There’s a nowness to it, that’s for sure,” says Jamie Holmes, a management consultant who lives less than a mile from the track. He has recently completed the legendarySpartathalon ultra-marathonin Greece, which is 153 miles. When I ask why he keeps doing such long races, he says he can’t really explain it, but thinks he’s trying to break himself. “I suppose I’m trying to find my limit,” he says. “Maybe when I find it, I’ll stop.” Shankara Smith, the race director, says that the biggest challenge is yourself. “Sri Chinmoy used to say it’s not mind over matter, but heart over mind. If you can’t silence that mind, then you can’t do it, because your mind will tell you you can’t. Here, you can’t tell yourself it’s you versus that mountain, because there is no mountain. It’s just you versus you.” Smith has watched the race every year since it started in 1989, when her father was the race director. “I love it,” she says. “If you’re here at 3am, the city is quiet, nothing is going on, but on the track, the atmosphere is zinging. But also peaceful.” I spend a few hours watching the runners lap the track. Everyone seems in good spirits; it’s a chilly, overcast afternoon, which is fine for the runners, and while a few have gone off fast at the front, most are running well within themselves, chatting to each other and joking with the officials. I decide to get some food and rest. Driving back to the track at 3am, I find it hard to imagine they are all still going but, sure enough, out on the floodlit track 15 hours after they started, the runners are still going around and around. About 10 (mostly those who started at the front in the first few hours) have dropped out. Some of those left look as if they’re in pain, their running styles twisted and contorted. Many are walking, but even that looks difficult. One man with a shaven head is walking slowly with his fists clenched; he looks as if he wants to punch someone. They have nine hours left to go. Some people stand out, calm and composed. One of them is 68-year-old Ann Bath. She’s not very fast, she’s a little bent over, but she is unrelenting. While others occasionally stop for a massage, or to eat something, she presses serenely on, never stopping. In the end, she runs an incredible 116 miles, an age-group world record. Holmes, the management consultant, smiles when he sees me again. He is now walking gingerly and his knee is heavily strapped. “I think I’ve found my limit,” he says. At the end of every lap, the runners pass a tent full of people with big clipboards and lists of numbers. The lap counters have to wave to their runner each time to show they’ve registered the lap, and the runners usually wave back to double check their lap has been counted. As the hours progress, an intimacy builds up. They get to know each other well, and there’s lots of laughing and joking. The runners say it gives them a lift. “Some races, you have a chip counter tied to your shoe,” one runner tells me, “but what I like about this race is that you have people doing it.” Another runner and his counter are trying to name a new animal each lap. After a while, the runner, his brain frazzled, stops and leans on the table edge. “I can’t think of any more,” he says. “I’m done. No, wait, flamingo!” And, with that, he’s off again. “You’re looking great,” one of the lap counters shouts to Holmes. “You’re looking beautiful,” he replies, his dazed smile now fixed permanently across his face, perhaps shielding the pain. When I catch him along the back straight, he tells me he misses his friends. “Normally I run with friends,” he says. “Without them here to tell me to stop being an idiot, I can’t find the will to try running again.” So he walks. But he doesn’t stop. Around the track, many of the support crews are sleeping on chairs or on the floor. Lauren Howes, whose boyfriend, Cameron Humphries, is doing his first 24-hour race, is struggling to understand what she’s doing here. “I don’t get it,” she says. “It’s like a cult. His heroes are notBrad PittorGeorge Clooney, but some ultra-runner guy.” “Kilian Jornet?” I venture. He’s just about the most famous ultra-runner I can think of; he runs up and down mountains. “Yes, that’s it. He’s got four pairs of his shoes.” Some of the crew are race veterans who can’t stay away. One tells me she was a marathon runner when someone at her club told her he had seen a race where people were eating sandwiches while they were running. “I didn’t believe it,” she says, “so I went to watch. I turned up in the morning and there was a group of people wandering around the track like zombies. I’ve been hooked ever since. If I’m not running, I’m crewing.” Although at times it seemed that it would never come, finally, at just before midday, we get the bell marking the last five minutes of the race. For the final few laps, the runners are joined on the track by family and friends. Fathers run holding hands with their children, couples run, or walk, arm in arm. One man decides to start sprinting, his support crew struggling to keep up, while another carries his young daughter. One woman, clearly in agony, is accompanied by her concerned husband and two teenage sons. When the hooter goes to signal the end, she bursts into tears. Others collapse on the ground where they are, or hug the nearest person. I find myself close to tears. One runner, the shaven-headed man with the clenched fists – he didn’t unclench them the entire race – is walking back alone across the infield. I ask if he’s OK. He looks at me blankly for a moment, as though I’ve just appeared out of the ground. “I just need to lie down,” he says in the meekest voice I’ve ever heard. And so it ends. I guess they’ll all go back to their jobs and people will ask them if they’re mad. “Why?” people will ask. “Why would you do such a thing?” And they’ll probably be unable to answer. But they’ll be back next year to do it all over again."
‘My body convulses – I’ve reached my limit’: can I handle SAS training?,"From ultra marathons to gruelling reality TV, extreme fitness is all the rage. Will special forces training in the Ecuadorian jungle teach me why? The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. Iinch along the jungle path, heat sapping my strength. The boils on my hand are throbbing; sweat pours into my eyes. And that’s when I see them. A group of men crouching in the undergrowth. Their leader is signalling our presence to the others. It’s an ambush. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. As they rip from the shadows, shouting in Spanish, I desert immediately and at speed. I plunge into the greenery, spines gouging my hands and face. I hear my friends being captured. Water fills my mouth and nose, my boots and pack dragging me down like sandbags. I am out of my depth in more ways than one. There’s a chance there are anacondas in this river. The vegetation is poisonous to the touch, and if I don’t drown, the likelihood of being ravaged by disease-infested mosquitoes is high. What’s my plan? As the strength leaves my body, someone grabs me, shackling my hands with cable ties. A hood is placed over my head. I don’t protest as I’m dragged out by my thumbs; it’s a relief. This cat-and-mouse game is all part of a much bigger game. I have been flown to the Amazon to undergo SAS training with ex-special forces operatives, who are also the stars of a reality gameshow. As a writer who works from home, I have perhaps the most sedentary job known to man (my pleasures usually involve snacks and stationery), so this is going to be a challenge. My kidnappers, Ecuadorian locals, have been briefed. Presumably, insurance paperwork has been filled out. But I can’t help feeling that the piranhas, venom-spitting snakes, rabid vampire bats and one weird-looking black toad don’t know the plan. The water in my mouth is real; the danger feels that way, too. Survival television has been upping the ante lately. From the start, the format emphasised toughness: rememberBear Grylls using a sheep for a sleeping bag, orRay Mearseating pig nuts and sleeping rough in his canoe? Now there is a clutch of far more masochistic shows, to which I am addicted, despite my better judgment. Currently airing is a new series ofHunted, in which ordinary people make themselves fugitives, living off-grid to evade capture by a team of manhunters. There isEden, a year-long experiment in which participants try to build a new society from scratch, isolated from their families and the modern world. The most gruelling, though, is the one I’m about to experience –SAS: Who Dares Wins, about to start its second series.The showputs 25 civilians through an intense course that recreates the UK special forces selection programme. This is the most challenging military entrance exam in the world, for a unit that is the model for all elite forces. Open only to serving soldiers, it has a dropout rate of more than 90%. In the TV version, contestants undergo enhanced interrogation, involving sleep and food deprivation, as well as ceaseless physical punishment administered by men with neck tattoos. What I have experienced so far is just a taste, and it doesn’t taste very nice. The fear begins weeks before, when I have nine injections, one of which contains live yellow fever virus. The nurse points to a map of the area of Ecuador I’ll be flying to: it’s the deepest red imaginable – red meaning risk. Aggressive daytime mosquitoes carryzika,chikungunyaanddengue, while malaria is a high risk at night. “You won’t have time to build immunity to rabies, so don’t get rabies,” she advises, not altogether helpfully. “Because it’s fatal.” The immunisations are followed by a psych evaluation in which a mental-health professional advises me on the likely fallout of the trip. “You’ll be disoriented, possibly depressed. It will be harder for the people you live with,” he says, which is the closest thing to comfort he offers. I’m questioned about my mental health history, the stability of my relationships. I’m warned that being displaced and undergoing trauma may lead to mood swings lasting weeks or months. My interrogators might dig up sensitive information and use it to manipulate me. Then there’s a physical exam in which I strap on a mask and power an exercise bike until my lungs burn. The doctor pronounces me of “below average” fitness. Not so unfit I can cancel (the sick note I was looking for), but unhealthy enough that I leave convinced I am going to die. With admittedly circular logic, I am putting myself through this to understand why people put themselves through it. I know people want to be on TV, but why notCatchphraseorDeal Or No Deal, where you might win some money? The appeal of Hunted and Eden I understand: they’re a chance to challenge the power of the surveillance state, to rewind the alienating complexity of globalisation. But why am I drawn to SAS: Who Dares Wins? I loathe machismo, scorn exercise, and would laugh if presented with anAndy McNabnovel, so what is it about lunkheads doing burpees until they’re sick that I find compelling? Where did this cultural appetite for self-punishment come from? “We lead very regulated lives, where almost everything is done for us,” explainsDr Rhonda Cohen, a sport psychologist at Middlesex University. “But knowing we can survive is a very important part of being human. We crave the feeling of being alive that comes with breaking routines and overcoming challenges. It’s extremely satisfying to use our bodies in new ways, and important developmentally. Kids get that feeling of reward all the time, because they’re always learning new things. It’s harder as adults.” This urge to push our physical limits can be seen in the rise in popularity of what I call lunatic or non-fun runs. Since 2011, there has been a 20% increase in people doing ultra marathons and extreme obstacle courses. There are plenty to choose from:Thames Path 100,Spartan Race,the Spine Race(268 miles along the Pennines in winter). There areIronman, double Ironman, Triple Deca Ironman triathlons.Tough Mudder, which involves only 12 miles of running, compensates by filling those miles with electric shocks, tear gas and rings of fire. As unimaginable feats become commonplace, elite competitors are seeking more extreme settings.The Marathon Des Sablestakes place in 50-degree heat in the Sahara, while the 135-mileBadwatercourse runs from Death Valley, the lowest point in the contiguous United States, to Mount Whitney, the highest. Meanwhile,spending on gym membership has risen by 44% in the UK in the last two years, and there has been a parallel increase in free,outdoor workoutssuch as park runs, wild swimming and cycling. We’ve changed the way we work out, too, moving from repetitive, machine-assisted exercises to more functional training. Where once we jogged sedately for hours, now we run, jump, squat and lift, movements the natural world once demanded of us. Increasing numbers of people want to train like soldiers, the most functionally fit people on the planet.British Military Fitnessruns 400 classes in 140 locations, and is adding more. “Athletes aren’t robust, they snap easily,” saysDr Sundeep Chohan, a medic who has worked extensively with the special forces and is dismissive of gym‑fit Instagram posers. “Military fitness is a combination of 20 factors – things like peak flow and blood pressure. These are supremely adaptable and robust people. Someone with a six‑pack won’t last long in the Antarctic, where you need body fat to survive.” Chohan is here with me in the jungle. So is Jason Fox, aka Foxy, a former SAS demolitions expert and the most approachable of the directing staff on Who Dares Wins. (Directing staff, or DS, is how the instructors are addressed; they prefer this to Sadistic Inquisitors or Total Bastards.) Foxy puts another myth to bed, about the SAS and masculinity: “Macho guys who come to prove a point about their hardness usually quit first, having proven nothing,” he says. “A course like this strips you down to your base level, which a lot of people don’t want. They don’t want to know what their real character is. The people who get through need to explore themselves, or something that’s happened in their lives.” Foxy joined the SAS because he disliked bullies, craved autonomy and was “fed up with the pageantry and bollocks of the regular military”. He is a gentle individual, with a lisp. It’s hard to remember, as we bounce down a dirt track in a truck, that he is a trained killer with exceptional military capabilities. Of the 350 men with whom he trained for SAS selection, only 14 made the cut. The other instructors are equally surprising. There’s Matthew “Ollie” Ollerton, who advises us on resisting interrogation. (Humanise yourself; practise the controlled release of information; never answer questions with a simple yes or no, because this can be manipulated into a recorded confession.) Ollie is referred to by another instructor as the “short-haired hippy”, and at one point I spot a whiteboard on which he has written: “When ego is lost, universality exists.” Jason and Ollie runBreak-Point, a company that teaches special forces techniques on corporate awaydays, which I would happily pay to watch. Then there’s Mark “Billy” Billingham, grizzled, blue-eyed and scary, the sort of man I imagine Gordon Ramsay fantasises about being. Billy is a spotter: crossing a line of leafcutter ants, he explains that humans are the only animals clumsy enough to break it. “Everything else will step over. If you see a broken column, there’s an enemy less than 18 to 20 minutes ahead of you – which is how long it takes the ants to reform.” Billy teaches us that immersion in the jungle eventually makes your skin reek of urine, due to the production of ammonia, “but you start to blend into your surroundings. I can smell soap on a person half a kilometre away.” He tells us his training turned around an unpromising childhood on a West Midlands council estate, where he was stabbed at the age of 11. “Suddenly I’m learning Serbo-Croat, performing throat surgery in the field, advising prime ministers.” Who Dares Wins features no weekly eviction; in the first series, there was no overall winner. Contestants simply try to endure: evading capture, rescuing casualties, being subjected to surprise interrogations and mind games, supporting each other through pain. Like Billy, many are aiming to turn their lives around, or overcome traumatic experiences. One contestant in the new series signed up after his son was killed in Afghanistan, having recently begun his own SAS training. Another, a young British Muslim who has suffered racist attacks, wants to prove himself as a role model. Reformed gamblers and ex-gang members rub shoulders with posh boys who want to be shorn of their privilege. It’s much more than vicarious thrills; whole life stories are being played out. Even so, I have to admit something makes me uneasy about survival television. It’s a strange thing to do, passively watch other people absorb punishment. How much further can shows such as this go? Are we headed forThe Hunger Games? The SAS selection process was last year the subject of a judicial inquiry after three soldiers died on the same training march in 2013.The deaths were attributed to neglect, butanother death followed in July this year,on another SAS march in the Brecon Beacons. Tests that explore the limits of human endurance may be necessary for those who want to join an elite fighting unit; it’s less obvious that civilians need go anywhere near them. The ultra-fitness craze is supremely at odds with the comforts of the first world: what are we compensating for? I’m marching through the jungle with a bag over my head, blackout goggles strapped over the top. It is 35C, the humidity 95%. I stumble over branches and snag myself on thorns, to the irritation of my captors. Every step feels irrationally as if I’m being walked over the edge of a cliff; and then they make me jog faster, totally blind. I’d like this to stop, I think. Semi-delirious, I no longer feel like myself and my thoughts run away with me. Maybe I should change my job. Or move house. Maybe I will run into a tree and be granted unconsciousness. The only way for a contestant voluntarily to withdraw is to remove their numbered armband and hold it in the air. Due to an acute lack of bicep, my armband has long since slipped off my arm and been lost. The feeling is akin to being chained in a dungeon with no safe word. (Probably.) Soon, that’s almost exactly where I find myself, when I’m dragged to a cell and made to hold various stress positions. These are unnatural poses in which one’s bodyweight is balanced on single muscles or joints – holding a deep squat for long periods, for instance. Even keeping my arms above my head proves agonising after 10 minutes. Threats are whispered in Spanish while my body convulses with pain. I’ve reached my limit. Today I have hung from ropes surrounded by hornets, holding my entire bodyweight until my arms crumpled. I’ve scrambled up banks through thick vegetation. There are vines to support me when both legs fail, but they bring the palms up in stinging boils, prompting a tricky cost/benefit analysis. I have fallen down steep climbs, slid face first through enormous webs, and now I can’t take any more. At this point, I am interrogated by Billy and another soldier, in scary mode, screaming questions in my face. I can remember neither the mission I am supposed to be on (something about reconnaissance on a drug plant), nor the cover story we invented. I know I have some names and coordinates on a square of notepaper tucked under my testicles, which I don’t want anyone to go looking for. Even when the hood is lifted and I find I am kneeling at the edge of a shallow grave, I give nothing away. The two men seem impressed by my resilience. The reality is that my brain has checked out. Yet I’ve been here only one day; the real competitors endure this quasi-torture for three sleepless days, spending 10 days in all pushed to their limits; when Foxy, Ollie and Billy went through real SAS selection, they did this for six months. Reality TV can never replicate these former soldiers’ experiences. In the first season of Who Dares Wins, Foxy revealed he was discharged from the SAS after suffering from PTSD. How does he feel about military training being mined for entertainment? “It’s education and exploration first,” he says, thoughtfully. “It’s about showing people that our humanity gets us through tough moments, not about being tough. We’re not invincible superheroes, and people can relate to that. It drives them to do better for themselves.” It’s hard to make the connection between physical achievement and emotional satisfaction if you haven’t experienced it; but, once you have, it’s hard to break. Back in the UK, after my arms and legs and face have recovered, I find myself mentally reliving the few moments when I didn’t let myself down. Scaling a tower of logs and throwing myself into deep brown water from the top. Accurately recalling the location of our camp when questioned, out of breath and disoriented. Spying the kidnappers early, gaining a time advantage and having the confidence to brave the bush. Even if it was just for a minute, I freed myself. I am left with an entirely unexpected feeling: pride. A few months later, I am turning into one of the people I hate. Someone who does exercise, and even worse, talks about it. I’ve started running, and swimming. I’ve started running around my local park. On holiday in France I circumnavigated a lake, clearing 8km without realising it, then 10km. I’m wondering about a half marathon. It helps clear negative thoughts, gives me a sense of self-reliance, a scale of achievements I can be in control of reaching. I finally understand the value of exercise, and all it took was a simulated kidnapping and some piranhas. Given the choice, though, I’d still choose Deal Or No Deal and a large cash prize. No contest SAS: Who Dares Wins begins on 17 October, Channel 4, 9pm"
The Ultra Trail of the Gobi – the hardest race in the world?,"During this race, our reporter will face temperatures ranging from -20C to 30C, wild dogs and 250 miles of inhospitable desert – and the clock never stops ticking Aweek is a long time in running. Or, to be more precise, a week is long time if you are planning to run pretty much continually throughout it. After a few rash decisions and some naive optimism, I am now in the Gobi desert inChina, about to face this exciting, if somewhat daunting, prospect. TheUltra Trail of the Gobi(UTG) describes itself as a 400km (250-mile) single-stage, self-navigated, self-supported race. Loosely based on the journey of aseventh-century Buddhist monk Xuanzang(he took several years), the route passes some truly inhospitable terrain in Gansu Province. In his records, Xuanzang describes it as a place that contains “nothing but barren sand and dry river beds”, where “when it is hot, the heat sears you like a flame; when it is cold, the wind cuts your flesh like a knife”. Based on information from someone who has checked out the course, it doesn’t sound as if much has changed in the past 1,400 years. During this race, the 49 other competitors and I will have to battle with temperatures ranging from -20C to 30C, avoid underfed wild dogs and wolves and face a 3000-metre mountain thrown in for good measure. The cut-off time is 150 hours – and the clock runs continuously. The UTG is part of a growing trend among runners to experiment with just how far they can physically go. Twenty years ago, people might have been impressed with a marathon, but since then, distance inflation has been rampant. Much as most long-distance runners hate to admit it, impressing others can’t be ignored as a motivation and, when aslightly overweight, middle-aged standup comedian ran 27 marathons in 27 days, they ceased to produce the requisite awe. It’s perhaps unsurprising therefore that ultramarathons (technically anything more than 26.2 miles) have been rising in popularity over the past decade. In the US, the number of runners completing races of more than 50km (31 miles) rose from roughly 11,000 in 2000, to more than 72,000 last year. In the UK, there has also been an explosion in the number of “ultras”, with many selling out at the speed of Glastonbury tickets. With a growing middle class, China has also seen the races’ popularity rising fast in recent years; it seems life has to be quite comfortable before one voluntarily choses to make it uncomfortable. The UTG is in its own league of “super ultra” races. To put the distance into perspective, the world’s most famous desert race,the Marathon des Sables, which I trudged my way through in 2014, is 250km and is broken into six stages over six days. Add in the navigation, the extremes of temperature and the need to develop a “sleep strategy” and the Gobi ultra becomes a logistically complex form of self-flagellation. Signing up for the UTG in June didn’t leave a great deal of time for training. The advice I received from others who had done similar events was simply to run as much as possible. With an 11km plod to and from work and a couple of long runs on the weekend, I was able to build up to 120-150km a week quite quickly but, between work and travelling, I struggled to go much beyond that. Food, both the eating of it and the planning of it, was the other priority. While training, I discovered a new appreciation of all-you-can-eat restaurants. For the actual race, the rules require competitors to bring 25,000 calories, most of which can be placed in drop bags along the course. In the past I’ve found most energy bars too sweet and synthetic, but recently I’ve been fortunate to discoversome people in Londonmaking sports food out of beetroot, goji berries and just about every other “superfood” you can imagine. My medical certification for the UTG wasn’t without complications. In February, I visited a doctor in Kathmandu for a routine checkup. Much to my, and I think his, surprise, he found a large hole in my heart. One open-heart surgery, a week in hospital and three months of impatient recovery later, and I was back to running again, a little out of shape, but now with the advantage of a fully functional heart. Joining me in the Gobi will be an impressive bunch of experienced masochists. The international field includesPavel Paloncy, multiple winner of thebrutal Spine race;Harvey LewisandMarshall Ulrich, both multiple winners of the famously gruelling135-mile Badwater race in Death Valley; andJenny Davis, professional ultra-runner and campaigner for women’s participation in sport. The Chinese competitors, including some who have already run the course, are known to be formidable. If I’m able to keep up for more than a few hundred yards, I might even be able to find out more about them. Signal and sanity permitting, I will be updating the Guardian running blog with my progress across the Gobi from 28 September. You can also follow my deterioration on Instagram@jogonalfie"
Runner's lie? Cheating rumors didn’t stop Robert Young – but something else did,"He started out strong from the Pacific coast with the goal to run 3,000 miles in 45 days. But things took a bad turn when suspicions arose over his rate of progress Walking stiffly down the shoulder of a busy road on the outskirts of Indianapolis on a sweltering June afternoon, Robert Young moved into the shadow of a slow-moving RV to get some relief from the beating sun. Thirty-four days into his journey from Huntington Beach, California, to New York City, the long-distance British runner was more than 2,000 miles from his starting point and still had 700 miles to go, in his attempt to break the record for the fastest run across the United States. About a mile down the road, a team of observers waited for Young to pass, including 62-year-old Gary “Lazarus Lake” Cantrell and several other longtime, respected runners who dubbed themselves “The Geezers”. But they weren’t there as fans, or to offer encouragement or moral support. They had a more dire intention: to determine whether or not the 33-year-old athlete was cheating. On 14 May, Young set out from the Pacific coast with the ambition to run 3,000 miles in 45 days. This goal would shave one day off the fastest transcontinental crossing ever achieved by a person on foot, which has stood since 1980 despite numerous attempts. Growing up in a small village in Yorkshire, Young was subjected to years of abuse at the hands of his father. As hedescribed in an interviewearlier this year, much of his ambition stems from a drive to overcome his harrowing past. According to his autobiography, Young considers himself to be an ordinary runner with an extraordinary ability to endure pain. Young is relatively new to the sport, but his compelling backstory has gained a wide following. He ran his first marathon on a dare in 2014, then proceeded to run 370 moreover the course of a year. The feat is documented in his popular autobiography, Marathon Man, and his fans regard him as something of an endurance savant. But however fit and talented Young might be, there’s a reason the transcontinental record hasn’t been broken for 36 years. Three thousand miles in 45 days breaks down to 67 miles a day – that’s two and a half marathons every day, for a month and a half. Even for Young, that’s a stretch. And yet, according toposts on Young’s blogdocumenting his progress, the first weeks of Young’s run were dominated by 70-mile and 80-mile days. Photos of Young looking relaxed and confident accompanied his updates, which raised suspicions in a mailing list for professional runners, Ultra List. “[His] tracker and GPS data are cans of worms,” Robert Lopez wrote to Ultra List subscribers. “There is a day that Rob’s RV got stuck in the desert. The location is known. [...] Whether he legged out the 40-plus road miles or somehow orienteered his way through the brush without navigational aids, [his] time is incredible. And I mean that in the literal sense.” Young made running across America look easy. Too easy, many skeptics argued on LetsRun.com. Among the criticisms were detailed analyses of Young’s claims, including speeds that had never been achieved before. “As he was claiming really big mileage, the doubts grew,” said Wouter Hamelinck, a Belgian ultrarunner. “Either he was exaggerating or he was throwing in world-class performances. For me, the most damning part is that his run totally changed after he knew that he was in the spotlight.” Indeed, after murmurs of Young cheating spread within the community, his speed began to decline. Young’s last 70-miler happened on 7 June, when he clocked 71 miles running through the Missouri heartland, the same day a Kansas runner named Asher Delmott posted accusations of cheating onLetsRun.com. Delmottwrotethat he went to meet Young, only to find his RV driving slowly down the road with no runner in sight. He then tracked down surveillance cameras of the RV doing the same thing in different locations along his route. “After it drove by, I ran into the highway, turned on my headlamp to strobe mode, and started running behind the RV,” he wrote. “It was driving running speed, so I was making progress, but they saw my light and stopped.” Delmott suggested that Young was occasionally riding in the RV when he claimed to be running. Rumors began to spread even more. Young’s team fervently denied the speculations on theirFacebook page, and posted videos explaining why the incidents were a misunderstanding. However, theydeclinedto release GPS data until after the run had finished. This emboldened critics, who took their claims to popular running media such as Runner’s World,Outside MagazineandSports Illustrated. As cheating speculation spread, Young’s team reported compounding physical and mental strain. His daily mileage plummeted. He clocked 44 miles on 9 June and 40 miles on 10 June. Meanwhile, “The Geezers” were becoming aware of Young’s story. Spurred on by encouragement from the community, Cantrell rallied a group of longtime runners and launched a crowd-funding campaign to cover expenses. Their intent: to shadow Young’s every move for the remainder of the run, observe his progress, and document what they saw. Their observations wouldn’t prove or disprove the allegations, but they would provide credibility – or lack thereof – to Young’s effort. “I was an accountant for 35 years and look at this as an auditing job,” Cantrell said. “[Young’s team] welcomed us when we got here. They want an independent record.” On 11 June, Cantrell’s “Team Geezer” watched Young battle to finish a meager 41-mile day in Illinois. Cantrell said he believed Young had already entered “the death spiral”. For five days in early June, Cantrell and The Geezers drove behind Young’s support team RV through Indiana and Illinois, and parked at various pullouts alongside the road, observing Young as he passed by. Weeks into his journey, Young was struggling to run 40 miles a day – a far cry from what he’d accomplished at the beginning of his journey. Cantrell, a guru-like figure with a long gray beard, watched sympathetically as Young strained through every mile, frequently hobbling at a slow walking pace. On 15 June, Cantrell watched as Young fell face-down ont o a road just outside of Indianapolis, cutting his forehead. When his crew reached him, Young’s face was covered in blood and he was asleep. “But he did get up, every time,” Cantrell said. “At times his pace slowed to a mile an hour. To be perfectly honest, if he were an entrant in a race I directed, I would have pulled the plug. But whatever the outcome … it is a shame that no one may ever appreciate the sheer determination that it took to get 40 miles today.” Cantrell said he respected Young’s grit and sheer stubbornness, as well as his remarkable ability to recover after appearing utterly broken. But in five days of following Young’s every move, Cantrell didn’t witness any indication that he was capable of achieving the mileages he claimed in the first days of his transcontinental run. Young was good, but not great, Cantrell said. Despite his injuries and his tenacity, the question of whether or not Young had cheated early on in his journey remained. The discrepancies in his pace – from 70 miles a day to less than 40 – were just too big to believe that Young had ever been able to run at such high speeds in the first place. “There remain serious questions about the first part of the run. I hope they do have the data that will present a believable explanation for all of the discrepancies.” Cantrell said. Still, in the days Cantrell spent with Young, he grew fond of him. He offered the struggling runner advice and gear, including one of his own cotton dress shirts, which he explained would help keep Young cooler in the heat. He also instructed Young to cut holes in his shoes to relieve pressure from his swollen feet. On 16 June – 34 days into his run – Young donned Cantrell’s shirt, shoes and hole-riddled socks, then proceeded to gut out 61 miles. Cantrell marveled at this late comeback after five days of running only 40 miles or so. Sixty-mile days are what Young needed to stay on record pace. “I was doing the math to see when it would be over,” Cantrell said. “But Robert Young was not over. He came out and walked for a while. Then he started to run and run and run.” Later that evening, Young checked into an emergency room in Indianapolis, where he was diagnosed with a fracture in the fifth toe on his right foot, as well as cellulitis – a painful and potentially serious bacterial skin infection. His team vowed to “battle on”. And then they went silent. The blog and social media accounts went quiet and his online tracker stopped moving. Cantrell said Team Geezer abandoned the watch. “I am done because I do not want to be a party to putting Robert Young in the hospital,” Cantrell wrote in an email. “This much I will say. It seems to be a consistent part of this pattern, to make claims that an individual is somehow physiologically different from everyone else. They are not. “What I saw was the same thing I have seen from multi-day runners for decades. The bright-eyed, chipper runner that I first saw last Sunday was reduced to a shambling, hollow-eyed shell.” Young waited until 20 June to officially announce the end of his record attempt “for medical reasons”. He continued to deny accusations of cheating. “In order to clear up this matter, in the next few days all data from the trip, which should exonerate me from any suggestion of wrongdoing, will be made available for examination by all concerned parties,” he wrote. Young insisted he would provide data from his GPS watches – as well as reasonable explanations for the suspicious surveillance videos. Several of Young’s most fervent critics said that if his watch data checks out, they will concede their suspicions that he cheated. But Cantrell, remains a skeptic. As a self-proclaimed “old-timer”, he tends to credit officially recorded race performances over what he views as dubious technologies. But Cantrell knows his questions might be falling on closed ears. Young’s fans are eager to see him pull through. “The overwhelming social media response has been adulation and accolades, with the few dissenting voices effectively drowned out. He does not need credibility with the ultrarunning community. They are not the target market.”"
Ultra-distance runner Damian Hall on setting a new record: 'I recommend a daily sob',"The holder of the South West Coast Path fastest known time talks custard, crying and falling asleep on his feet At 8.19pm on Tuesday 24 May Damian Hall reached Minehead and the end of Britain’s longest National Trail, the South West Coast Path (SWCP). In doing so, he set a new fastest known time (FKT) for the 630-mile footpath of 10 days, 15 hours and 18 minutes, knocking more than 16 hours off the previous record. He averaged 60 miles per day. Hi Damian, have you recovered yet?My feet are a lot less grumpy. I’m no longer waking in the middle of the night in a sweat. And I can no longer eat three breakfasts without subsequent pressure being applied to my belt. So, hopefully, I’m partly recovered. I haven’t tried running yet. Talking of which, what made you think running 630 miles would be a good idea?I’m not sure I ever did. It was my good friend Mark Townsend’s idea, and he’s a persuasive fellow. He co-owns Contours Walking Holidays and wanted to run the SWCP to help promote his company’s new arm,Contours Trail Running Holidays. More than that, though, he used to have the FKT and he wanted it back. So two of your started, but only one finished?Mark had a knee problem from an accident a few weeks before our attempt, but he’s a heroically stubborn bugger – he once refused to drop out of the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc after a mid-race stroke. He did the first 300 miles of the SWCP with me, but was in increasing discomfort and we slipped behind the then FKT. He had to stop, but really didn’t want to – the FKT meant a lot to him. But it made me all the more determined to set a new record on his behalf. From then on he became the tactical mastermind and his wimp-management skills came to the fore. How so?I never thought of giving up. But I could get a bit despondent. I usually started running at 5am and because the terrain is so hilly – there’s around 111,000ft of ascent, more than three times up Everest – it took time to log the miles. Four miles an hour was the fastest I managed, and I rarely reached that. By about midnight I’d be inclined towards a lie down, especially if there was a bit of a storm on the go and the path went along remote clifftops. Sometimes Mark had to calmly explain that it wasn’t bedtime quite yet if I wanted to set a record. Where did you sleep and eat?We had a VW Transporter Kombi, which was superb, and a good friend, Tom Jones, crewed for us. This meant feeding us at all hours, driving down ridiculously narrow and steep lanes, putting up with how ungrateful, grumpy and foul-smelling I was, running out to meet me in the middle of the night in apocalyptic storms and probably a thousand other things I don’t even know about. That man is a marvel. And he makes a mean “custard surprise”. He still won’t tell me what was in it. How did your body cope with 630 miles?I got plenty of niggles – in fact, every previous injury I’ve had returned as if it had never been away – but it was amazing how my body just seemed to deal with them, strengthen and overcome them. I remember on day eight realising that my legs felt fantastic, really good – a tribute to my coach, Ian Sharman. My feet got a bit fed up and blistery towards the end, but feet can be a bit self-important like that. What was the lowest point?The days when Mark was struggling were horrible because I could see how much he wanted to continue. I guess as I got more and more tired – I was averaging three hours’ sleep a night, then two for the last two nights – it was harder to remember to enjoy it. I allowed myself to feel oppressed by the task and it felt relentless sometimes: yes, you’ve done 60 miles, but there are still 200 to go. I fell asleep on my feet at one point. I also cried a bit, often just a five-second burst. I think that was just sheer tiredness, missing my kids and guilt about being away from them. But I felt amazing again after a quick weep. I recommend a swift daily sob to everyone. And the highlight?The scenery was very special. So many handsome bays, coves, beaches and rugged cliffs. I saw deer, seals, hedgehogs, badgers, foxes chasing rabbits. But also people were so supportive when they realised what I was doing. I was often given cash towards my fundraising or free meals, free ferry rides, bags of sweets. People are great. Yay for people! Why try to set a record?It’s hard not to answer in cliches, but it’s a wonderful adventure, in a very special part of the world, where you learn things about yourself. I can often go through a week mostly on autopilot, only half alive. When you do something like this, you spend most of the time right there in the moment – above all because you have to watch where you’re putting your feet – and that mindfulness has to be good for you. And you go through so many emotions. You’re alive. You can be quite sleepy, but you’re definitely alive. How did you get into ultra-distance running?I did my first marathon in 2012. I loved it and hated it and wondered, what next? Luckily, Outdoor Fitness magazine sent me to run an ultramarathon and I fell head over heels in love with the concept. The scenery, the camaraderie, the sense of achievement, all that compression-wear and cake. No wonder their popularity is booming. They’re far easier than most people seem to think. And trail running is so much better for you than road running, physically and mentally. So what’s next?The Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc is the big one for me, in Chamonix in August. But I’m already scheming and dreaming about more FKTs. Damian Hall is an outdoor journalist and ultramarathon runner. You can find more of this sort of hogwash atwww.damianhall.infoand@damo_hall"
"Jasmin Paris: 'I rarely run on roads, only to get to the hills'","The new Bob Graham Round record-holding fellrunner on prosecco and pizza, and feeling like she could run for ever On 23 April, fellrunner Jasmin Paris broke the women’s record for completing the legendaryBob Graham Round, a 66-mile circuit scaling 42 of the highest peaks in the Lake District. Her time of 15 hours and 24 minutes was more than two-and-a-half hours faster than the previous record set by Nicky Spinks in 2015. Hi Jasmin, have you recovered yet?Yes. I feel pretty good, actually. How long did it take you to get over such an epic feat of endurance?Well, I did the round on Saturday, and I was back running on Tuesday, a few days later. Didn’t you want to take some time off to rest?Not really. I love running, that’s why I do it. I live near Edinburgh, right by the hills, so I just felt like going for a run. Was this your first attempt at the Bob Graham Round?No, I had run it before. Normally, I like to run without any support, no fuss, so I first did it as a winter round with my fiance, Konrad. We did it in 22 hours 28 minutes carrying our own stuff - the only support was my mum at some of the road crossings. But once I’d done it following the purist approach, I then decided I wanted to try to do it fast. Did you think you could break the record? Was that the plan?I thought I could break it, but not by that much. Nicky Spinks had the record and I generally finish ahead of her when we race, so that gave me the belief that I could break the record. A few weeks after you broke her record,Spinks ran a double Bob Graham Round[completing the circuit twice in a record 45 hours 30 minutes]. How did you feel about that? Did she steal your thunder slightly?No! I was there supporting her. I felt bad, actually, for breaking her record, so I was glad she got the record for the double round. That’s not one I’ll be chasing. How did you get into fellrunning?I didn’t start running until after university. I’d always walked a lot in the hills, so I guess it was a natural progression to start running in them. Once I had a busy job, I realised I could get out into the hills in less time if I ran. Also, a colleague suggested I run a fell race. I just had normal running shoes on and it was quite slippy, so I spent most of the time on my bum. But I loved it. What’s next for you?I’ll be doing some sky races in Europe: the Skyrunning world championships at theBuff Epic Trailin Spain, then theUTMB[Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc]. I’d also like to try thePaddy Buckley Round[in Wales] and theRamsay Round[in Scotland] at some point in the future. Are you getting invited to more races since the Bob Graham Round record? Have things changed?A bit, though I was getting invitations already. But I’m not one to chase the limelight, so things haven’t really changed. People keep talking up my chances at the UTMB, though, but it’s further than I’m used to, so we’ll see. What’s your favourite place to run?That’s quite hard. I’m tempted to say the Lake District, but I don’t know. What was your first ever race and how did it go?It was that race my colleague got me to run, a local fell race in Glossop [in the Peak District]. It was a revelation to me that there were people running around in the hills like this. I loved it. What advice would you give to anyone attempting the Bob Graham Round?It’s good to know the route well. I ran around the route twice, in winter and then again in March. Even if you have a support team that knows the route, it helps you mentally if you know what you’ve got coming. Another big thing is not to do it in bad weather. People get everything set up and if the weather is bad they just try it anyway. But bad weather can foil your attempt. I’d say schedule it for two weekends in a row in case the first one is bad weather. Do you ever struggle with motivation?No. I struggle with having enough time, but not motivation. Maybe if I ran on roads I would, but I rarely run on roads. Only to get to the hills. Do you listen to music when you run?No. Only in the gym on a treadmill – which is something I only do under extreme necessity. What is your favourite running gadget?Er, my compass? I don’t really use gadgets. I have a GPS watch, but I rarely wear it. This may be difficult for you, but what’s the worst thing about running?The muddy shoes I have to clean. And the best thing?Mostly the places I get to run in; that’s amazing. Then behind that is the feeling of being fit, the feeling that you could run for ever. What’s your post-race indulgence?When I’m racing, most Sundays, after the race, we have prosecco, pizza and ice-cream. That’s our recovery meal! And what do you have for breakfast before a race?Porridge, with raisins and flaked almonds. Have you ever tried barefoot running?Yes. I used to walk around barefoot a lot as a kid. Then, a few years ago, when I had achilles tendinitis, I found it was better running without shoes. So, until it cleared up, I ran in the hills mostly barefoot. Finally, who is your running hero?I’d have to sayJoss Naylor, in a sense. He was still working as a sheep farmer, then he would go and run, say, the Pennine Way in some crazy time, and then come back and carry on working on the farm."
How was your weekend running?,"Track session, parkrun, long run or just breaking a world record on a treadmill? As always, come and share your weekend exploits (even the non record-breaking ones) below the line My loathing of treadmills is well documented on this blog, and I hold to my theory that treadmill miles relate to outdoor miles in the same way that dog years relate to human years - they are at least seven times longer. Which makes the fact thatSusie Chanran for 12 hours on a treadmill on Saturday (68.5 miles) breaking the world record in the process particularly jaw-dropping for me. It’s not so much the physical exertion that amazes me, though heaven knows that’s impressive enough. No, it’s the mental effort. It would be one thing to run 68.5 miles in a line, towards a destination, with a physical finish line to cross. But in a room, on a treadmill? That requires an effort of will I can’t even begin to imagine. Well done Susie. Possibly a rest day today though, eh? My own weekend involved a curtailed track session, dropping out with a worryingly niggly calf, followed by a very tentative long run yesterday of 16 miles. Plenty of calf raises and stretches for me over the next few weeks, and fingers crossed that it doesn’t develop into anything more serious. So, how was your weekend running? I saw lots ofWinter Runmedal-wearers getting off various tubes and buses on my meanderings around London yesterday and spotted quite a few PBs on Strava too.
