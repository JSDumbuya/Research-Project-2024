"we spoke with a certified diabetes educator for tips on how to keep your blood sugar level stable on the run. proper nutrition is key to a successful run, race, or workout. but for runners with diabetes, fueling (and the timing of your fueling) is even more important. and, often, medication plays a role as well. we spoke withamanda kirpitch, ma, rd, certified diabetes educator (cde), to break down everything runners with diabetes need to know to keep running strong. keep in mind, every person is different, so it’s important to speak to your healthcare professional before making any dietary or exercise changes. there are two kinds of diabetes diagnoses—type 1 and type 2. type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition in which the body produces little to no insulin, which is the hormone needed to allow sugar to enter the body’s cell from the bloodstream. type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body can’t effectively use sugar as fuel, creating too much sugar in the bloodstream. the most common symptoms of diabetes are increased thirst, urination, hunger, exhaustion, and weight loss. if you are experiencing any of these symptoms without cause, you should contact your doctor. →sign up for runner’s world+ for unlimited health, fitness, and nutrition tips! whether you have type 1 or type 2, you should monitor your glucose levels closely during your run, kirpitch says, because your glucose levels may fall during and after your run. it can fall as quickly as 30 minutes into the activity and anytime thereafter. (also, exercise can exacerbate an already-falling glucose level, highlighting the importance of monitoring your sugar before activity.) the risk for hypoglycemia remains immediately following activity and up to 24 to 48 hours after. however, the body’s response to activity may differ depending on the medication a person may be taking to manage their diabetes. if a runner is taking a hypoglycemic oral medication or insulin, the risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is higher. if a runner with type 2 diabetes is not taking insulin or hypoglycemic agents, the run may require less monitoring. when using insulin to manage diabetes, keep in mind that if there is insulin in the body from a previous meal still working to reduce glucose (commonly referred to as insulin on board or active insulin), the risk for hypoglycemia is higher and adjustments should be made, says kirpitch. “a recent insulin dose can be more powerful if it is quickly absorbed into a working muscle,” kirpitch says. “many runners choose to inject insulin into their abdomen, and avoid dosing in legs and arms, which are muscles most engaged during running.” there is also a risk of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), particularly if diabetics may reduce the amount of insulin they receive during a run, or if they don’t think about the impact of anaerobic activity, says kirpitch. high blood sugar can cause the body to produce ketones (molecules produced by the liver), which can also be quite serious."
"checking glucose throughout the day (via cgm or fingersticks) can help to better understand glucose patterns and adjust medications accordingly. eating a variety of foods helps to better understand glucose response and better dose for the meals/snacks you’ll need to fuel your workouts and your day. “working with your diabetes team to learn the response to running at different times of day and planning nutrition and medications to optimize performance and glucose management is key,” kirpitch says. if you’re not wearing a cgm, it is good practice to check glucose at 30-minute intervals during exercise to assess patterns and make adjustments to management routine, kirpitch says. it is best to catch a dropping glucose level before it goes low, so you can appropriately treat and continue activity. once glucose is low, activity should stop until glucose returns to normal. keep in mind cgms use interstitial fluid to monitor glucose, and there is a delay from blood glucose. due to rapidly changing glucose during activity, it is good to recognize that glucose may be lower than value displayed on cgm. typical symptoms of low blood glucose vary from person to person, but they can include feeling: it’s important to keep in mind that with adrenaline and focus that often comes with exercise, especially on race day, classic symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked. this is why it’s critical to spot check glucose frequently throughout activity or utilize a cgm to assess patterns, kirpitch says. generally, thefueling for runswill be similar to what would be recommended for those without diabetes. “ideally the medications and/or insulin would be dosed according to the fuel needed and subsequent glucose response,” says kirpitch. experts recommend that your glucose levels pre-workout should be about 126-180 mg/dl. choose snacks that are quick-digesting carbohydrates and have small amounts of protein and fat closer to the time you run in order to minimize gastrointestinal stress. have more substantial meals including fat, protein, and higher-fiber carbohydrates 3 to 4 hours pre-run. if you’re running for less than an hour, you don’t need to worry about bringing fuel for that run; pre-run snacks and meals are usually sufficient. however, runners at risk for low blood glucose should carry a form of quick-acting glucose to treat potential low blood glucose or hypoglycemia. typical treatments are glucose tabs,glucose gels, dried fruit, candy, orsports drinks, suggests kirpitch. runners at risk for low blood glucose should also carry a meter or wear a continuous glucose monitor (cgm) to monitor glucose during activity. runs that last longer than one hour can be aided by fueling with mostly carbohydrates every 30 minutes to one hour. fueling can begin 30 minutes into the run at 30 to 60 grams per hour for runs lasting one to two hours and 60-90 grams per hour if runs are longer than two hours. “i always recommend runners carrying their own fuel and treatment as opposed to relying on fueling stations to have what they want or need at the right time,” kirpitch says."
"there are many factors that go into managing your diabetes on race day. running is considered an aerobic activity, which often results in a drop in glucose. however, your surge of adrenaline before the race starts (and at any other points in the race) can cause a rise in glucose, kirptich says. so, you should learn how your body reacts during different exercise intensities and lengths before race day so you know what to expect. “it’s important to consider the different ways your body responds to glucose throughout a run as well as different types of runs,” kirpitch says. “practicing with some shorter race events can give you an idea of how your body responds to the stress of a competition prior to your big day.” after the activity, refuel with carbs and some protein. there is a risk for hypoglycemia immediately following activity and up to 24 hours later. there is also an increased risk for hypoglycemia overnight particularly following a late afternoon or evening workout. it’s a good idea to ensure adequate carbohydrates at these pre-run meals and snacks. activity passively allows glucose into the cells, reducing the body’s need for insulin. this allows for increased insulin sensitivity—which in turn can make glucose levels lower. often, activity (as part of a healthy lifestyle) can improve glucose regulation, kirpitch says. however, self-management strategies around exercise and activity are highly individualized. everything you need to know about hip pain how to increase mileage running periodized training can help you hit your goals marathon pace charts for fine-tuning training first boston marathon? here‘s what to know foods that cut inflammation to improve performance how to estimate your lactate threshold pace how to plan your 2024 race schedule ultramarathons—you can go farther than 26.2 miles the benefits of resistance sprints new york city marathon 2023 faq why you need to slow down on your recovery runs a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"only six percent of sports science studies focus on women, but these top researchers aim to change that number. here’s what they’ve learned in their work about how to train and reach peak performance. michelle barrack, ph.d., associate professor of nutrition and dietetics at california state university, long beach, fell in love with running her sophomore year of high school. while she played other sports like soccer and tennis, there was nothing like lacing up her spikes and racing on thetrack. and she excelled. butbone stress injuriesand low bone density limited her training and eventually forced barrack to quit running competitively while in college. her experience sparked a new passion. she wanted to understand the risk factors associated withbone healthin runners and help others, especially young women, avoid a similar experience with low bone density and injury. barrack isn’t the only scientist whose personal interest inspired their research.shefali christopher, d.p.t., ph.d., associate professor at tufts university and a former collegiate athlete, was competing intriathlonswhen she got pregnant with her first child. she wanted to keep training but when she searched for advice on exercising whilepregnant, she came up empty handed. a few years later, she noticed that many of the runners in herphysical therapypractice were sidelined with injuries one to two years postpartum. “there’s no research in this field. i started to think, is there something that we’re missing?” she says. barrack and christopher are part of a growing group of women who are studying female athletes and closing the gender data gap in sports science research. currently, only6 percent of sports science studiesfocus exclusively on women. that means that most training and nutrition guidelines, along withinjury preventionprotocols, are based on studies of men and how male bodies adapt and perform. the good news? the research world is starting to change. for example, christa wille, d.p.t., ph.d., who studies biomechanics at the university of wisconsin-madison, insists on including women in her data sets even though it makes her work more challenging. the female body’s fluctuating hormones can add more “noise” to the data, a main reason why women are excluded from scientific studies. “why not include women? why not let them be a part of this? why not let them benefit from this research as well? we’ve got to start somewhere,” she says. on aninstagram post, celebrating her successful defense of her ph.d.,megan roche, m.d., ph.d., research lead for thestanford female athlete science and translational research (fastr) programand ultrarunning coach wrote, “i hope this research plays a small part in building more complete female athletes, with strong physical and mental health. female athletes and coaches are the future. and i’m so excited to help the research catch up.” runner’s worldtalked to seven women scientists and researchers who are helping to bring better guidance to girls and women in sport. they’re also debunking myths and setting the record straight about the best way women should train. whileosteoporosisseems like a concern only for older adults, low bone density is a problem among young runners, as barrack’s experience shows."
"approximately20 percent of collegiate runnerssuffer from one or more bone stress injuries per year. what’s more, when barrack looked at the data on femalehigh school runners, she found that low bone density was prevalent in these athletes too. among this younger population, barrack and her colleagues identified threefactors associated with poor bone health. athletes with fewermenstrual cyclesper year or no cycle had lower bone density. those who ran more than five or more seasons—a sign they may be training year-round—and those who exhibited higher levels ofdietary restraintalso had lower bone density. the findings surprised barrack, suggesting that you don’t have to be a high-level athlete, like collegiate or pro runners, to suffer from low bone density. barrack worries because adolescence is a critical bone-building period when you accrue the majority of your adult bone mass. once bone density has decreased, it’s challenging to recover. among high school runners who had poor bone health, researchers foundnearly 90 percentstill had low bone density three years later. barrack says these trends are showing up in middle school athletes too. “prevention is just really important to optimize bone health,” she says. “we can’t start young enough.” for young athletes who are girls, expand your horizonsbeyond just runningand play multiple sports, especially high-impact, multi-directional sports. (parents should encourage this too.) for instance,studieshave found that ball sports improve bone health in young athletes. strength training can also help. in barrack’sresearch, she found that more muscle mass was beneficial to bone. researchers have identified inadequate nutrition as the key factor in the persistent problem of low bone density among runners. “we know it’s likely low energy availability that is contributing and affectinghormonefunction, which will impact bone health,” barrack says. when athletes are under-fueled, the body prioritizes essential systems and suppresses the menstrual cycle and other hormones that are essential for bone health. but, if athletes improved their nutrition and maintained a positive energy balance, would that reduce the number of bone stressinjuriesamong female runners? barrack and roche were both part of aseven-year study involving collegiate runnersat two ncaa division i universities that set out to answer that question. athletes received nutrition education combined with individual consultations with a sports dietitian. sessions focused on helping athletes optimize energy intake and supporting athletes identified ashigh-riskfor bone stress injury, based on menstrual health, previous injury and bone health history, and eating behavior and attitudes. they found a clear link betweennutrition, hormones, and bone health. when athletes ate enough to support their training, they maintained healthy levels of hormones (like estrogen) that are critical for building and maintaining bone. they saw fewer bone stress injuries in female middle- andlong-distance runners, specifically in the pelvis, sacrum, and femoral neck. bone tissue in these areas is more hormone-sensitive and likely to be more resilient because of the healthy hormone levels. roche says paying attention to a stress fracture’s location could provide insight into an athlete’s hormonal health. if the injured bone tissue is more hormone-sensitive, it may suggest that the athlete and her healthcare team should take a closer look at hormonal health and nutrition."
"while the answer to improving bone health seems simple—eat more—it’s not always easy. barrack says runners may not meet theircalorie requirementsbecause they don’t know how many calories they actually need or they aren’t hungry after exercising, a time when they should refuel. plus, it’s hard to fit meals andsnacksinto a busy schedule. the key is intentional planning. “what’s my next day look like? how can i make sure that i have food available to me throughout the day?” barrack says. if you don’t have time for a fullbreakfast, think of grab-and-go options. the goal is to distribute your calories frequently throughout the day and avoid long periods of time without eating. aim to eat every two to four hours. and barrack says don’t skip thecarbs. it’s an essential macronutrient for overall health and athletic performance. according to a recentsurvey, only a third of new moms received any guidance on physical activity. for those looking for sport-specific advice like how to resume running, there’s little to no information. izzy moore, ph.d., associate professor in human movement and sports medicine at cardiff metropolitan university, wanted to fix that. she, along with her colleagues, set out to understand what factors contribute topostpartumwomen’sreturn to runningand what hinders it. in herresearch, she found that women were hesitant to resume running because they didn’t know “what happened down there.” if they felt heaviness in the vaginal area (a sign of possible pelvic organ prolapse), they didn’t lace up their shoes. the lack of guidelines compounded this uncertainty because it led women to catastrophize every twinge or ache and left them scared to run. moore says this fear of movement has been identified as a factor related to anterior cruciate ligament (acl) injuries but hadn’t previously been linked topostpartum runners. pain is also a barrier to running and christopher’sresearchwas one of the first to examine the risk factors that lead to running pain in postpartum women. she found that incontinence, fatigue, lack of sleep (less than an average of 6.8 hours per night), and a previous running injury all increased the odds of experiencing pain. returning to runningpostpartum will depend on personal experience: how much did you used to run? did you run during pregnancy? did you experience any pregnancy orchildbirth complications? are you experiencing symptoms of incontinence? both moore and christopher recommend consulting with a physical therapist first—ideally one who works with postpartum runners or a pelvic floor specialist. concreteguidancemay alleviate some of the fear of movement and uncertainty women may experience. if something doesn’t feel right in your pelvic region, consult apelvic floor physical therapist. “a lot of women run and leak urine and think it’s normal, but we confuse common with normal,” moore says. “women shouldn’t have to accept that. it can be treated and managed.” physical therapists can also identify areas of weakness and develop astrength-buildingprogram to support your running. “your body will be deconditioned after pregnancy,” moore says. start with gentle core andhip-strengthening exercises, like pelvic tilts and hip bridges, before progressing to moves likesquatsandlunges. from there, be sensible."
"“if you used torun a 5kin 20 minutes, don’t do that straightaway,” moore says. stick with a plan that gradually builds your run volume like acouch-to-5k program. while lack ofsleepis inevitable for new parents, christopher says you can adapt your training based on your level of fatigue. you can also reimagine your goals. “if you want tobreastfeedand wake up to feed at night, maybe your baseline for running is lower than normal. maybe you’re running for exercise but not competing because your goals are different right now,” she says. there’s no denying that bodies change as we get older and running can feel different. duringperimenopause, the phase leading up to the final menstrual period, many women notice an increase in body fat along with hot flashes,fatigue, and brain fog, symptoms that can be debilitating. while changes inbody compositioncan play a role in the change in fitness you feel, research suggests that body fat isn’t entirely to blame. in a recentstudy,sam moore, a doctoral student at the university of north carolina chapel hill, found that higher body fat percentage was linked to more symptoms in perimenopausal women. but she’s quick to note that the actual percentage isn’t what’s important. rather it’s maintaining a steady body fat percentage. “even women who enter [perimenopause] with a higher percent body fat, if their percent body fat was stable across the menopause transition, it was indicative of lower symptoms,” she says. “percent body fat is the relationship between fat and muscle. women are maintaining or increasing fat but more importantly, they’re losing muscle,” saysabbie smith-ryan, professor of exercise physiology at the university of north carolina chapel hill, who’s working with moore. muscle mass and quality declines because of age and decreasing hormones. “that’s the conversation we should be having,” she adds. studiesfrom smith-ryan’s lab show that women who engaged in vigorous exercise had fewer menopause symptoms. they believe it’s becausehigh-intensity exerciseactivates muscle, potentially blunting the loss of muscle and keeping body fat percentage more stable. “it also targets visceral fat, which is likely linked to increased symptoms,” smith-ryan says. while researchers continue to tease apart the cause of menopause symptoms, smith-ryan says a great step is to focus on building and maintainingmuscle. “running long distance is good for your mental and cardiovascular health but doinghigher-intensity worklike intervals stimulates muscle, which is what we see changing the most in perimenopausal women,” she says. target 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week and strength train twice a week. runners can be creatures of habit. we love moving our bodies on theroads and trails. why wouldn’t we run all the time? well, there can be too much of a good thing, especially for women in peri- and post-menopause. “one of the things with runners is our mitochondria are really efficient,” smith-ryan says when describing the energy center in our cells. while efficiency sounds like a good thing, it means that if you run regularly, your body burns less calories than when you were a new runner."
"plus, smith-ryan says perimenopausal women show greater signs ofmetabolic inflexibility, meaning your body has a harder time switching between burning carbohydrates andburning fat, which is key to health. taken together, this can lead to weight gain and potentially more menopause-related symptoms. you don’t have to give up running. instead, smith-ryan recommends picking something you’re not good at whether it’s swimming,lifting weights, or doingintervals. being a beginner will challenge your body—andmetabolism—and can help you feel more like you. and while this is true especially for peri- and post-menopausal women, almost everyone will benefit from trying fresh forms of exercise and challenging the body in new ways. christine yu is an award-winning journalist and author of the book up to speed: the groundbreaking science of women athletes. her work focuses on the intersection of sports science and women athletes. she's a lifelong athlete who loves running, yoga, surfing, and skiing. tips to make consistent fitness progress benefits of zone 2 running how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week? avoid going out too fast in a race how to run slower on easy days all about running tests for improved performance all about the maf method it’s time to rethink mileage vs intensity how to run with knee arthritis and reduce the pain all about heart rate training stop worrying about pace so much in workouts a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"you’ll get some real mileage out of these gifts. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? ultrarunners tend to be unique people. they’re often more dedicated than your typical folk, turning their enthusiasm for running—and running a long, long way—into a lifestyle. to that end, they’re sure to appreciate a gift that somehow lends itself to their unbridled passion forlong-distance gallops. but choosing such a gift can be a challenge, especially if you yourself are not an initiate of the singular realm ofultramarathons. never fear—we have suggestions. below, you’ll find the best gifts to help ultrarunnerstrain, compete, andrecover. your primary consideration when shopping for an ultramarathoner involves which phase of their experience you hope to contribute to: training, competition, or recovery. here are some ideas for each phase. ultramarathoners train for running, obviously, but when it comes to races of ultra duration, they’re specifically training for stamina, mental fortitude, and injury avoidance. there are a variety of tools that can support these pursuits, like fitness trackers, training shoes, resistance bands, and much more. there are a lot of specific pieces of equipment that can vastly improve an ultrarunner’s competitive abilities once the race has started, like race-friendly hydration vests or energy gels for mid-race refueling. from items that support comfort and safety to straightforward race essentials, you can help them gear up for race day. while post-activity recovery is important in any sport or fitness pursuit, few endeavors require rest and recuperation quite like an ultramarathon, which can involve running as far as 100 miles. there are many ways you can contribute to your favorite ultrarunner’s convalescence once the race is finished, including cozy recovery shoes, percussive massage guns, and muscle-icing apparatus. as a lifelong runner, i’ve spent decades experimenting with an expansive range of running gear, and i’m an old shoe at recognizing quality from inconsequential. i’ve bolstered this experience with input from the editors atrunner’s worldand other outlets, and have taken into account reviews from customers, too. the recommendations below span a wide range of budgets, tastes, and ultrarunner needs, and each will in some way contribute to ultramarathon training, performance, or recovery—and in some cases all three. a qualityhydration vestis at the core of any dedicated ultrarunner’s kit. the ultra vest 5 from ultimate direction does everything a runner could want it to, offering plenty of cargo space within its 10 pockets, conveniently located trekking pole holders, outstanding comfort and durability, and high water capacity with its dual 17-ounce flasks and space for a 68-ounce reservoir. some buyers do report quality issues with the included flasks, but those are easily replaceable. it’s a great vest in every other way. if you’re looking for replacement flasks to include with the ultra vest, or simply just a pair of high-quality running flasks by themselves, you can’t do better than hydrapak. these 17-ounce flasks will fit in most vests, collapsing as they empty."
"an easy open cap and easy access straw make it effortless to sip while you run, and a speed-fill lid makes stops at the water station as short as possible. a very small number of buyers didn’t like the straw, but they are in the minority. ultrarunners tend to spend a lot of time under the sun, which means they need to pack protection. this sunscreen stick from verta is a great option as it’s highly packable and easy to apply while in motion. it has no nasty ingredients and is water resistant for 80 minutes. i’m recommending the clear version in particular, which is spf 45. there is a stronger spf 50+ version, but only in the visible cream option, which can start to look very streaky once you get sweaty. if you’re shopping for an ultrarunner who tends to race on trails rather than pavement, saucony’s updated peregrine 13s are a great fit. not only are they extremely lightweight and comfortable—as all ultra running shoes should be—but they offer solid foot protection and traction. some users say that the large traction knobs take some getting used to, but once that’s accomplished wearers report that they deliver an outstanding degree of stability, and a rock plate built into the sole ensures that sharp rocks don’t jab through and interrupt the race. read peregrine reviewsshop women’s for long races over pavement, most ultrarunners look for a shoe that offers plenty of cushioning and minimal weight. the saucony triumph 21 delivers on both fronts. at just 9.8 ounces, it rates alongside other ultralight shoes, and its pillowy soles will provide outstanding cushioning through dozens of miles of racing. what’s more, the new flat-knit upper and redesigned lacing system translates into impressive comfort. support is very limited, but beyond that these are fantastic shoes for long road races. shop men’s when a person runs for dozens and as many as 100 miles, chafing can and likely will be an issue. this anti-chafe balm from body glide will solve the situation by reducing the friction caused by rubbing while running, and it does so without leaving an oily or greasy residue. if you hear your giftee often complaining of chafing between their thighs or on their underarms, this is a great gift that’ll get plenty of use. it’s sweat and water resistant, and is sure to help improve comfort over the course of the race. garmin makes a lot ofgreat fitness watches, some of which are theoretically more running-oriented than the venu 3. but i’m suggesting the new and improved venu 3 because it boasts the brand’s most accurate fitness and sleep tracking yet, along with their latest fitness and sleep coaching programs. this makes it an invaluable tool for training, competition, and recovering afterward, helping the wearer to track data and improve their performance and rest. it’s also a great all-around smartwatch, so you can’t go wrong."
"when it comes to entering the singular realm of ultrarunning, it’s sometimes hard to know where to begin.the ultra marathon bibleprovides a wealth of great information on various race types, training, mental preparation, in-race advice, post-race recovery, and more. perhaps just as valuable as all that info is the motivation it imparts, as there are few mental and physical challenges quite so extreme. for the ultrarunner who’s just starting out, this book is a must. ultrarunners almost always rely on various forms of on-the-go energy to make it through their lengthy races. that’s where honey stinger enters the picture. these energy chews are easy to pack, taste great, and provide a burst of carbs and calories to keep runners fueled. my only wish is that they would offer a variety pack spanning a range of their sports snack products. i said i wanted more honey stinger items, right? so here we are. sometimes the energy chews aren’t enough, and runners need something a bit more substantial to keep them fueled. these tiny waffles taste great, are easy to carry in a vest or pocket, and make for solid snacking throughout the race. the variety pack includes five flavors, and i personally am partial to the cinnamon. every ultramarathoner wants to show and share their accomplishments. with the bibfolio plus, they’ll have amplehooks for hanging medalsand a bib holder for collecting and displaying race numbers. its minimalist design fits into any living space, and it’s easy to install. gone for a run has even thrown in a dozen bib protectors, just for good measure. ultrarunners go through a lot of socks. theserunning socksfrom feetures are my favorites because they feel great, with a tailored design that doesn’t bunch up or shift around to cause blisters. our staff even recommends them as the best socks for long runs—and we’ve tried a lot of socks. they’re moisture-wicking, which is important as sweat and precipitation can build up over a long race. all in all, these will help make the whole thing more comfortable. when you’re running an ultramarathon, stretching before and after is essential. manduka’s pro mat is widely considered the standard-bearer among yoga mats—and it lasts for decades. its 6-millimeter thickness delivers cushioned support without making it tough to balance. the surface materials and uniquely textured top layer are as slip-proof as they come. and it has some great color options, which never hurts. before and after the race, most ultramarathoners appreciate something warm and cozy to wear. the scuba hoodie from lululemon offers outstanding comfort, with its thick, soft, breathable cotton. our tester particularly liked the oversized hood (more space for long hair or just to burrow into) and thumb holes. its relaxed fit is designed to be worn comfortably over workout clothes, and it looks fantastic. for men, i like this affordable hoodie from true classic. all of true classic’s products are made of soft, comfy material, but what i really like about its various lines—the active hoodie included—is that they’re cut for more athletic frames."
"the hoodie is also quick-drying and moisture-wicking, as well as antimicrobial to prevent odors. it’s a welcome thing to slip into after a rigorous race. brooks’ run visible line not only delivers the best visibility of any running jacket, period, thanks to its eye-catching combo of high-vis colors and patterns plusreflective material, but it’s also simply a great running jacket in general. it’s got decent wind and water resistance and is warm enough for cooler temperatures. but if the wearer heats up while running, the jacket can be converted into a vest that will continue to provide visibility and a bit of cargo storage. any time of day—but especially during low-light conditions—this is an outstanding piece of running apparel. for earbuds that not only sound fantastic but feel comfortable through hour after hour of running, the jabra elite 8 actives are unrivaled. their sound quality is surpassed by few earbuds, but where these truly stand out is in terms of more practical ultramarathon considerations such as durability, battery lifespan, and comfort. the elite 8 actives adhere to military standards for rugged electronics. they’ll keep pumping out sound for eight hours with noise canceling on or 14 hours with noise canceling off, and can last up to 56 hours with a fully charged case. and they feel great in the ear. nick hilden is a writer, globetrotter, and jack-of-many-talents who has written gear reviews for the likes ofrunner’s world,popular science,men’s health,thrillist,the daily beast,the los angeles times,greatist, andthe manual, and his lifestyle, culture, and tech writing has also appeared inscientific american,afar,salon,vice,healthline, and many others. before entering journalism some 15 years ago, he worked as a bartender, brewery manager, sound engineer, recording and touring musician, cook, teacher, and in a variety of other trades. these days, he lives all over the world, performs music sporadically, and spends a lot of time thinking how to best improve his honda element conversion. the best books that will motivate you to run 14 thoughtful valentine’s day gifts for runners best affordable running shoes the best self-care gifts for taking a rest the 49 best gifts for runners who love gear the best cheap gifts under $30 for runners the 40 best fitness gifts for your fittest friends 30+ last-minute gifts for runners 38 gifts for runners who are just getting started the best gifts for triathletes 24 great father’s day gifts for dads who run the 30 best gifts for your husband a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"here’s what runners should know about how ketosis may affect their performance. the ketogenic diet has been popular for several years now, as its hailed for limitingcarbohydratesand uppingfatintake, mostly in the name ofweight loss. if you’re looking to change up youreating habitsthis year, you may be wondering if the keto diet is right for you—and can it help your run performance? to get to the bottom of the pros and cons of the keto diet for runners, we talked to dietitians to get the full scoop. here’s what to know before you swap all the carbs for all the fats. the ketogenic diet (or keto diet) sets very strict guidelines on how to break down your macronutrient (carbohydrate,protein, andfat) intake. those following keto consume 80 percent of their calories from fat, 15 percent from protein, and 5 percent of calories from carbohydrates—the fuel source your body and brain prefer to tap first as it’s the fastest and most easily accessible. staples of the keto diet include fish, meat,eggs, dairy,oils, and green veggies. even healthy, complex carbs such as whole-wheatpasta, rice, potatoes, and fruit are off-limits. here’s how the keto diet works: when your body no longer has access to fuel from carbohydrates—either because they’ve been cut from your diet or you haven’t eaten in a long time—it goes into a state called ketosis. that means, your body looks for the next best fuel source: fat. and it uses the available fatty acids to produce a compound called ketones, which is why people who are in ketosis and eating more fat will start to burn more fat. the ketogenic diet is not to be confused with a low-carb high-fat diet, which is similar. the difference is the keto diet aims to increase the ketone levels in your blood, causing your body to enter ketosis. while our bodies prefer to feed on carbohydrates, ketonescanactually fuel thebrainand body, sayslizzie kasparek, r.d., a sports dietitian with thesanford sports science institute. so it’s not like you’re depleting your body in a dangerous way. “being in ketosis does not imply reduced muscle glycogen levels. over time, the keto-adapted athlete may improve his or her ability to burnfatfor fuel and still have glycogen available,” sayskenneth ford, ph.d., director and ceo of the institute for human and machine cognition. (as long as the athlete carb loads.) whether runners, specifically, should put their bodies in a state of ketosis depends on your goals—and the verdict is still out on whether it really helps with performance. most studies on keto and athletes involve only a small number of participants and most researchers say we need more studies on the topic. for example,one small studyof five endurance athletes, published in thejournal of the international society of sports nutrition,showed that a 10-week keto diet improved the athletes’ body composition and well-being but not their performance. in fact, the athletes initially experienced reducedenergy levelsand an inability to undertake high-intensity bouts of exercise."
"anothersmall studyin the journalmedicine & science in sports & exerciselooked at the effects of the keto diet on exercise efficiency in eight trained athletes. after following the diet, the athletes saw a decline in running speed and power—running speed atvo2maxdeclined by 5 percent. other research, including areviewof seven articles on the subject, says that there’s limited findings on the benefits of keto for endurance athletes and results are mixed when it comes to vo2 max and other performance outcomes. “there isn’t really a lot of good research that shows those people can perform better, and that’s really what runners care about,” kasparek says. ford also points out that in the studies looking at ketosis and performance with negative results, the athletes are not often sufficiently fat-adapted (when the body is trained to tap fat stores for energy, which can take several months) or even in ketosis, making it hard to truly gauge whether the diet is effective when it comes toperformance. also, performance generally involves an athlete exercising at a relatively high intensity, which requires carbohydrates as the main fuel source. runners who may benefit from fat adaptation are those running long, long distances, likeultramarathons. once you hit those later miles, your body relies on fat for energy production. for everyone else, carbs are still probably your best bet, especially if you’re running at higher intensities than you would be when running 50 miles. when you’re running at alower intensity, your body is able to burn fat as fuel, kasparek explains. “but because carbs are the main source of fuel at higher intensities, you may be sacrificing keyworkoutsor your race to follow a certain diet,” she says. so, does the keto diet work and should you try it? the bottom line is: if done right, runners who need to be able to tap into fat stores overlong distancesmay benefit from occasionally eating fewer carbs and relatively more fat around longer, less intense training sessions. a runner does not necessarily need to be in ketosis to follow this type of “carbohydrate periodization.” runners who dospeed workoutsor who enjoy shorter distances at faster paces or who incorporatehigh-intensity workoutsinto their training are still better off eating a healthy,balanced dietthat includes carbs. for weight-loss goals, kasparek says, it’s possible to lose weight by tweaking a regular diet, say, by adding more healthy fat or cutting outprocessed foods. (and focusing on a calorie deficit.) but there’s more than one way to lose weight, and onebananaisn’t going to set you back—we promise. heather is the former food and nutrition editor for runner's world, the author of the runner's world vegetarian cookbook, and a seven-time marathoner with a best of 3:31—but she is most proud of her 1:32 half, 19:40 5k, and 5:33 mile. dr. namrita brooke is a full-time endurance sport coach and sport nutritionist advising active individuals and amateurs to professional athletes. she is also an adjunct professor in the department of movement sciences and health at university of west florida."

"no matter their sport, these gifts will excite kiddos and keep them moving. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? kids love to move. after all, playgrounds provide an infinite source of exercise in the form of play. and most outdoor games require some form of exercise—often running—like tag, hide and seek, and hopscotch.regular exercise for kids has a host of health benefits, not unlike those for adults, including stronger muscles and bones, decreased risk of chronic health conditions, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and improved mood, according tokidshealth.org.the physical activity guidelines for americansrecommendthat children ages 6 to 17 years old do at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day.to get (or keep!) your kids excited about regular exercise, we’ve rounded up our favorite items. what kid doesn’t love a good competition? the fitbit ace 2 tracker makes it easy for little ones to hit that 60-minute daily activity recommendation with a customizable goal. in addition to movement reminders, sleep tracking, and kids-only view on the app, fitbit ace 2 has active incentives like virtual badges, to stay moving and compete with friends. no more “but it’s cold and rainy” excuses for staying inside all day, thanks to the patagonia baggies jacket. it’s light enough for running and other outdoor activities, while still fending off rain and wind. like adults, kids have stuff to carry and the baggies jacket has hand and chest pockets for the essentials. the perfect hoodie for little runners (and their friends). “let’s race!” how many times have you heard kids yell that to each other? whether they’re logging miles at recess or playing in the yard, theserunning shoesdeliver on speed, comfort, and durability. adults love thefresh foamline from new balance, making them the perfect option for active kids.

"turns out, 11-year-old jackson li is a running super fan. and wow, does he have stories from paris. dakotah lindwurmfinished the olympic marathon on august 11 in paris and in a post-race interview, she mentioned a young american boy, about 10 years old, who was running alongside her at about the 22-mile mark and yelling her name during the race. “he gave me so much inspiration,” said lindwurm, who wasthe top american, in 12th place, in 2:26:44. “i need to find him. i need to give him a high-five.” runner’s worldwrote about it—and the internet did its thing. later that day, jackson li of larchmont, new york, was identified as the boy. he’s 11, so lindwurm was pretty close in guessing his age. and he runs distances—cross-country and the 1500 and 3,000 meters for the tailwind track club in westchester county, new york. li toldrunner’s worldhis pr for the 1500 meters is 5:05. so it makes sense that he could keep up with lindwurm for roughly 400 meters, according to his estimates, even when he was dodging other spectators and cheering for her. once they were connected, lindwurm sent him a package of goodies, including one of her bib numbers in paris, photos, a hat, and some puma shoes. on her bib she wrote, “jackson, bet on yourself.” that turned out to be an appropriate message for a sixth grader with a few nerves before his first year of middle school. the connection with lindwurm, however, was just the final chapter in an incredible olympics for jackson, his younger siblings, cody and hazel, and his parents, courtney knowlton and terence li. jackson is something of a running super fan. he and his mom, who has a two-year running streak going, never miss an episode of the popular podcastali on the run, and recently, they’ve addednobody asked uswith kara goucher and des linden to the rotation. he watched every episode of clayton young’syoutube seriesdetailing his paris olympics build. jackson even watched the team ingebrigtsen television series, subtitled in english.jakob ingebrigtsenof norway was his favorite athlete—until the olympics. (now it’s lindwurm.) about a year ago, jackson started pointing out to his parents that the olympics would be happening in paris and wouldn’t it be fun to go on a family vacation? he kept bringing it up. his parents hemmed and hawed. and then over the winter, terence li lost his mother, and the situation made knowlton decide they were going. “we’ve got to just do the things we want to do,” she said. they were in the stadium for the dramatic men’s 1500 meters and watched americancole hocker take the gold. ingebrigtsen was fourth. they also sawgabby thomaswin the women’s 200 meters. as the track was emptying out, jackson managed to get close to where thomas was waiting to do a television interview. he screamed her name, and she signed his hat."
"the next day, jackson and his dad, who runs ultramarathons, went out to examine the hilly section of the marathon course a few days before the men’s marathon and to scout viewing locations. out on the course, they encountered jess mcclain, who took a selfie with them, although she asked them not to post it immediately. unbeknownst to them,she was on her own course reconnaissance mission, in case she would be needed as the olympic alternate. (mcclain ultimately wasn’t entered, although fiona o’keeffe dropped out in the first mile of the olympic marathon with an injury.) for the men’s marathon, they staked out a cheering position near the 30k mark. jackson ran alongside young briefly, cheering for him, and young later mentioned on thecitius magpodcastnoticing a young boy cheering for him and running next to the course. at the 30k fluid station, american marathonerleonard korirtossed out his hat and picked up a fresh one that was affixed to his fluid bottle. who picked up the hat korir threw to the side? jackson, of course. (he’s holding the hat in the image at the top of this article.) amy begley, usa track & field’s director of long distance running programs, was working at the fluid station, and she pointed out to jackson that the hat was autographed inside. back at the track that night, jackson managed to get photos withfaith kipyegon, who won her third gold in the 1500 meters, and masai russell, who won the women’s 100-meter hurdles. and he handed his hat back to gabby thomas for autographs from the rest of the women’s 4x400-meter relay team. jackson, his parents noticed, was the perfect age to be seeking autographs. “in four years, it wouldn’t be as endearing,” li said. the next morning, after a late night at the track, it was a bit of a struggle to rouse the family to go back out to the women’s marathon. knowlton was insistent, especially because they had had so much fun cheering on the men the previous day: “we’re not skipping the women because we’re tired,” she said. and that led to the moment—or about 90 seconds—alongside lindwurm. all in all, it was a dream vacation for the family. knowlton called it “wholesome,” and she said it was fun to root for the american athletes and wave their u.s. flag in europe, even as the country experiences divisiveness at home. “we’re so grateful for the whole experience,” knowlton said. “the athletes were so open to the kids. it was an amazing way to spend time with our family.” sarah lorge butler is a writer and editor living in eugene, oregon, and her stories about the sport, its trends, and fascinating individuals have appeared inrunner’s worldsince 2005. she is the author of two popular fitness books,run your butt off!andwalk your butt off!"

"give the gift of running, cycling, and swimming excellence. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? triathletes aren’t like other sports aficionados. as the name suggests, they have to be three times the athlete, as a standardtriathlonspans 1.5 kilometers of open-water swimming, 40 kilometers ofcycling, and10 kilometers of running. these races are among the most challenging of physical endurance competitions, so any gear that can help with training, performance, and generally surmounting the ordeal will always be appreciated. accordingly, you’re searching for something that will help lend your favorite competitor an extra dose of oomph. as a lifelong runner, cyclist, and swimmer, i’m not only highly knowledgeable about these activities, but have used and tested countless pieces of gear spanning virtually every imaginable relevance, and i know which products actually help and which are all hype. to expand upon this, i have scoured reviews from top triathletes and other sport and fitness experts, as well as reviews from real buyers on amazon. based on this experience and research, i’ve made recommendations that are specific to each triathlon segment, others that apply to them all, and others still that aid with training and recovery before and after. these are the best gifts for triathletes spanning a range of budgets and competition levels. the garmin venu 3 is a great gift for triathletes as it can support all aspects of the sport, assisting with training, collecting performance data, and helping with sleep management. i was already a huge fan of the venu 2, and the latest generation has taken notable steps forward by improving the fitness and sleep tracking accuracy, adding a bevy of new functions pertaining to training, recovery, and sleep, and improving the design in a number of practical ways. and beyond sports, it’s a great smartwatch in itself, providing plenty of applications and communication tools. there’s even a flashlight! if weather or circumstance prevents cycling outdoors, a cycling trainer allows dedicated riders to use their bike indoors. frequently these trainers can be so jerky and rattly, however, that the experience is rather tedious, and those who live in apartment buildings end up angering their neighbors with vibration. the garmin tacx neo t2 smart trainer eliminates all of that. its incredibly smooth flywheel feels like real outdoor riding, and reduced vibration means that you won’t bother anyone. connect to the included app to track performance, and the tacx training subscription allows you to follow immersive training videos on tv. while it’s definitely one of the pricier indoor trainers, it’s also definitely among the best. a solid transition bag—the hub where a triathlete stores and switches through all their gear—is a must on race day. zoot’s ultra tri bag proves why thanks to its smart, durable design. with plenty of storage space and dedicated pockets for everything, including a helmet and wetsuit, it does a great job of keeping everything organized while separating the dry from the wet."
"comfortable on the back and shoulders and durably crafted, this bag will be a welcome inclusion for years of racing. energy gels are a tried and true go-to for a bit of extra fuel on the go, providing a dose of vitamins and nutrients to help a triathlete keep up their pace over the course of a race. i’m a fan of honey stinger’s wide-ranging sport snacks in general, and that includes its energy gels. with this variety pack you can give the gift of ten gel packs spanning two flavors, which should last through somewhere between 3 and 10 competitions. whenever you’re discussing the best helmets for road cycle racing, the giro aerohead will inevitably enter the conversation. thanks to its outstanding aerodynamics it helps riders cut through the wind, but the reason i’m singling it out is thanks to the outstanding protection afforded by its mips rotational impact liner. other helmets might be a bit lighter, while others still may have better visor optics (though the aerohead visor’s magnetic attachment is nice), but i’ve seen enough smashups on race day to know that safety takes priority. there are a ton of adequate massage guns on the market, but i’m recommending the theragun mini because triathletes can toss it in their bag and pack it along for race day. that way you have it on hand if a cramp strikes. the mini has three speed settings and provides firm, steady repetition. it also comes with three different massage heads so you can choose how wide or targeted you want its strike to be. people love this thing. pretty much the only criticism you can level at it is that the price certainly isn’t cheap. for truly dedicated triathletes, data is essential to analyzing and improving performance. with form’s smart goggles, wearers benefit from practical swimming considerations like a comfortable, leakproof fit and anti-fogging, but they also receive an array of data in real-time pertaining to factors like time, distance, stroke rate, pace, and more. they come with a one-year subscription that includes over 1,500 workouts and 30 training plans which are instructed live via the in-goggle display. is a transition mat going to make or break a triathlete’s performance? probably not. will it make the race a bit more comfortable? sure! this mat from kona provides a non-slip, dry surface for changing out of a wetsuit, then rolls up small for easy packing. as an added bonus, its bright color options are easy to spot among a sea of towels in the transition area. when it comes to choosing cycling shoes specifically for a triathlon, two considerations surpass all else: easy transitioning—meaning that the shoes will come off fast when it's time to switch to running shoes—and minimalized weight. these shoes from triseven nail both factors, delivering fast removal and clocking in at a feather-light 285 grams. they’re breathable yet adjust well to provide a firm fit, and work with all the most popular pedal systems."
"their unisex fit makes them highly versatile, but that can make it tricky to choose the right size. the endorphin speed 3 from saucony is an outstanding pair of running shoes by pretty much every consideration. they consistently receive high praise for their outstanding cushioning and neutral yet stable support, and i personally think they’re among the most comfortable shoes i’ve ever run in. designed to add an extra spring to your step, they’re great for both training and race day. some wearers do report that their pillowy cushioning takes some getting used to, but the vast majority think they’re just as comfortable as i do. you can’t enter the race without a number, and this race number belt from rj-sport not only holds a triathlete’s number bib securely in place, but its soft elastic makes it comfortable enough that it won’t hinder performance. as an added bonus, it’s equipped with six loops for holding energy gel or bars. it won’t work with waists under 26 inches, but it adjusts and stretches to fit up to 70 inches. as any experienced triathlete will tell you, when you’re running for long periods with clothing and gear rubbing against your skin, things can get pretty chafed and uncomfortable. this anti-chafe balm from body glide helps prevent chafing, and it does so without leaving the wearer coated in greasy oil. it’s resistant to sweat and rain, and there are no nasty chemicals in the ingredients. a quality tri-suit is essential not only for competing, but for staying relatively comfortable throughout the race. santic’s tri-suit for women is a great option thanks to the fact that both its material and butt pad are fast-drying, which is very handy when you’re going directly from the water to a bike. it also has extra-wide arm holes, which helps to reduce chafing. a long cord attached to the zipper makes it easier to dress, and there’s a pocket on the left leg for energy gels, keys, or phone. fast-drying, with extra-wide armholes to prevent chafing and an extra-long zipper to make it easier to put on and take off, this tri-suit from synergy hits on all the key points. as an added bonus, it features silicone leg grippers to keep the legs from riding up, as well as a modesty panel at the crotch to provide a bit of…modesty. while it does have a zipping pocket at the back, it can be difficult to reach, especially on the go. as any fitness enthusiast knows, few things impact your training and performance as much as what you eat. the endurance training and diet cookbook is packed with great information about how and what to eat specifically for endurance competitions like triathlons. it details the best nutrition and foods to consume while training, then before, during, and after a race, and can generally help any triathlete up their game through proper eating habits. while the recipes it contains are only decent, the nutritional information it offers is invaluable."
"a solid set of swimming goggles are an essential part of a triathlete’s kit, and speedo pretty much sets the standard in that realm. with its vanqisher 2.0 line, the brand has increased peripheral vision by 25 percent while improving its anti-fogging capabilities. super comfortable and watertight, they feature interchangeable nose pieces so you can find your best fit—though a few reviewers do have issues swapping them out. that aside, these are all-around great goggles. for races that demand swimming in colder water, a wetsuit with full body coverage and greater warmth is key. the volt wetsuit line from xterra goes the next step by providing not only warmth and comfort, but improved performance. it accomplishes this by decreasing drag in the water while improving the wearer’s buoyancy—both of which translate into easier, faster swimming. this is a good wetsuit for competitors of any experience level, though more experienced racers may want to step up to xterra’s advancedvortexline. bike boxes tend to get a lot of complaints leveled against them, largely because they’re typically used to check a bike onto a plane, and anything involving airports, flying, and checked luggage is destined to draw ire. air travel issues aside, the roundtrip transition case from thule is the best bike box out there. super protective and relatively straightforward to pack, it’s an unrivaled option for keeping your bike safe while in transit. it also boasts integrated wheels for easier mobility and a built-in repair stand, the latter of which is completely unique. the case is very heavy and pretty bulky to store, but if protection is the priority, it will absolutely deliver. a travel towel is always a great item for a triathlete to pack along, and this microfiber towel from youphoria is a solid option. it’s available in a range of sizes from hand to full body, dries fast, and is highly portable. like all microfiber towels it’s only moderately absorbent, but it will more than suffice for a quick post-swim dry-off or to sop up some sweat. nick hilden is a writer, globetrotter, and jack-of-many-talents who has written gear reviews for the likes ofrunner’s world,popular science,men’s health,thrillist,the daily beast,the los angeles times,greatist, andthe manual, and his lifestyle, culture, and tech writing has also appeared inscientific american,afar,salon,vice,healthline, and many others. before entering journalism some 15 years ago, he worked as a bartender, brewery manager, sound engineer, recording and touring musician, cook, teacher, and in a variety of other trades. these days, he lives all over the world, performs music sporadically, and spends a lot of time thinking how to best improve his honda element conversion."

"follow these tips for maintaining your footing on rough or steep terrain. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? watch any europeantrail raceorultramarathonand odds are you’ll find runners huffing and puffing up insanely steepclimbsor tip-toeing atop razor-thin mountain ridges with poles in their hands. running and racing with poles is common practice in europe. yet, here in the united states, there seems to be a stigma that running with poles is a sign of weakness. “i’ve had people tell me that i’m ‘cheating’ using poles when i pass them because they allow me to push with both my legs and my arms and go faster. it’s not cheating. it’s a choice,” sayshillary gerardi, 2021marathon du mont-blanc90km winner and professional mountain runner for black diamond. despite being a perfectly acceptable and legal choice, manytrail runnersstill shy away from using poles. but you don’t have to. here’s how to run with poles, why they’re helpful, and tips for using them to help your performance. “if you can learn to use your poles efficiently, you’re reducing the amount of output and energy you need to use from yourlegs,” explains gerardi. this is because you can push with yourarmsand legs (versus only your lower body without poles), thus reducing the strain on your legs, “particularly if you’re going to be doing a bit of vertical gain,” adds gerardi. by dispersing weight between your arms and legs, it saves leg energy that can equate torunning fartherandfasterthan you could without poles. another benefit to using poles, especially for beginner trail runners, is that poles help youbalance better, particularly through technical and rocky terrain. instead of having two points of contact (your legs), you now have four to help keep balance. gerardi explains that having the two extra points of contact can help you more easily retreat to safety if you experience aninjury, like rolling an ankle, so they also provide a security measure. while poles can be a tremendous asset, they can also slow you down on the wrong terrain, so it’s important to know what type of terrain you’ll be running before thinking about bringing poles. poles are most useful whenclimbingsteep trails, however, determining how steep and long a climb needs to be to use poles largely depends on the individual.beginnersthat aren’t so focused on time may find poles useful on the shorter climbs, whereas time-focused runners may not want to take the time to break out the poles for short climbs. another time to use poles isduring descentsbecause they can help you maintain balance through rocky and dangerous footing while lesseningeccentricloading (that’s the weight you carry own a downward movement) of the muscles and joints. poles can also be a lifesaver for some runners during longultra-distance raceswhen your legs are screaming and you have nothing left in the tank."
"except for vertical kilometer races (very short, steep uphill races with no downhill), where you’ll be using your poles the entire time, you’ll most likely alternate between using your poles and not using them, so you’ll need to stow your poles away when not in use, such as on nearly flat trails. mosthydration veststhese days have some mechanism to carry poles when not in use. keep in mind, it takes time to take the pole out and stow them away when not in use, so that’s part of the strategy of using them too and something to practice. while there is no definitive rule of thumb for when to use poles, only by practicing can you develop an understanding of when poles are helpful and when they aren’t. running polescome in two configurations—fixed and adjustable. gerardi says that if you already know your pole length, it’s probably best to go with fixed poles because they are lighter. adjustable poles are better if you’re unsure of your length or want to share your poles with someone else. first-time pole users should start with adjustable-length poles. this will allow you to play with different lengths to find your ideal height, which is usually when your elbows bend at a 90-degree angle when holding the handle. you can also buy foldable poles, such as theblack diamond distance carbon, that can stuff into your hydration vest when you’re not using them, making them easier for travel. once the poles are adjusted to the correct height, knowing how to use the pole straps properly is vital. using the straps allows you to get better leverage by bearing weight on your wrist versus solely using your hand grip. to do this, thread your hand up from underneath the strap so it wraps around the bottom of your wrist. there are two main approaches to poling technique: double-poling and alternating poles with your legs. double-poling:this is when you place both poles simultaneously in front of you and take three steps between them. as you move forward, push through the poles with a slight lean forward and repeat. double-poling is typically used in very steep terrain. alternating poles:to do this, plant your pole in sync with your naturalstrideandarm swing. the best way for beginners to learn this method is to start walking with a natural stride and arm swing with the poles hanging down from the straps. once you settle into a comfortable walkingcadence, grip the handles and begin planting the poles with an opposite arm and opposite leg pattern without altering your natural arm swing. plant the pole at roughly a 45-degree angle at a distance in line with your opposite foot. as you walk past the planted pole, push through the ground as your foot lifts. once you feel comfortable using the alternating pole walking, practice it while running. at slow speeds, you’ll plant the poles every step as you did while walking. as the pace quickens, you’ll want to plant the poles every second or third step."
"gerardi warns that if you don’t practice before using them before a race or big trail run, “poles won’t help you, they’ll get in the way, you’ll getblisters, and you’ll get frustrated.” so to get better before using them for big events, start with short runs; as you get more comfortable using poles, you can take them on more extensive outings. running with poles will initially look and feel awkward. that’s expected and okay. as with any skill, it takes time to learn it. and as far as looking awkward while carrying running poles, don’t worry about trying to look pretty. gerardi says that most of the photos of professional runners with poles are staged photoshoots. “it’s hard to make using poles look rad, but everyone is doing it; everyone uses poles,” gerardi says. gerardi shares her best tips for mastering running with poles. some areas don’t allow carbide tips because it scratches up the rocks and can contribute to erosion. if you place your pole tip on a rock, it can skitter off, and you lose energy. if you place it on soft ground, you’ve got a better chance that it’ll support you and help propel you forward. you need to really familiarize yourself with whatever system you’re using (across the back, belts, quivers, etc.) so that you don’t get frustrated. if you are going uphill with poles, you need to take care not to stab someone behind you. poles should be held so that the tips point down. when you get back from an outing, clean them off, wipe them down, and try to dry off the water that gets into the moving pieces to avoid things getting rusty or stuck. sticking a pole between two big rocks and putting all of your weight on it at an angle can cause them to break. if they get stuck, try reversing the action/motion of how you placed the pole rather than pulling it in the direction you want to go. test out your poles and the folding/opening mechanisms in the days before a big race/event you care about. sometimes they get sticky and hard to fold. do some research on your airline about putting your poles in your carry-on versus checked luggage when you’retraveling. cory smithis a running coach and journalist specializing in running and fitness-related content and gear reviews. he is the founder ofrun your personal best, an online running coaching business that has helped hundreds of runners achieve personal bests in distances ranging from 800 meters to 100 miles. cory holds a usa track & field level 1 and 2 endurance certification and was the former head cross country/track coach at penn state brandywine. over his running career, cory has held three maryland state records, was a two-time national championship qualifier while at villanova university, and holds personal bests of 4:03 in the mile and an 8:05 in the 3k."

"because a little bit of movement can go a long way when it comes to relieving period pains. let’s be honest, sometimes going for along runis the last thing on your mind when you’re experiencing menstrual cramps. in these times, practicing yoga can serve as a smart alternative as it can soothe your body and mind, and even help strengthen your running muscles, so you maintain yourfitness goals. that’s why we tapped two experts to explain how practicing yoga can assist in easing your period cramps. find some relief with these tips and poses. theamerican college of obstetricians and gynecologistsestimates that more than half of women who menstruate experience some kind of pain for one or two days each month. for some, that pain can feel mild and for others, it can become severe. during menstruation, “the uterine lining releases a substance called prostaglandins and the prostaglandins cause cramping of uterine muscle,” explainsbrandon martin, m.d., a physician in obstetrics and gynecology at st. luke’s hospital in easton, pennsylvania. though experiences vary from person to person, this release is what causes pelvic cramping, pain, nausea, and diarrhea. taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or naproxen, is one way to relieve menstrual cramps. but for runners, mixingnonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drugs (nsaids)with intense exercise can be risky, considering astudypublished inmedicine & science in sport & exercisein 2007, which included 55 ultramarathons, suggests use of these pain-relievers before, during, and after training can increase oxidative stress, which may be due to the meds’ affect on kidney and liver function. newer researcher on ultrarunners also points to the potential for negative effects on thekidneys. exercise is another way to address menstrual cramps. ameta-analysispublished in 2019, which reviewed 12 trials including a total of 854 participants, suggests exercising at least three times a week or more, for 45 to 60 minutes each, can help reduce menstrual pain, regardless of exercise intensity. in terms of yoga specifically, a recentreviewpublished infrontiers in pain researchhighlights several studies that suggest practicing yoga over the course of several weeks or months can improve menstrual pain. this is likely because yoga includes physical postures, breathing exercises, and relaxation methods that help manage pain. the exact mechanism through which yoga and other types of exercise provide relief from menstrual cramps is not fully known though, martin tellsrunner’s world. but many patients report that they perceive menstrual cramps as less painful and for shorter duration when engaging in yoga and other exercise activities, he adds. “yoga really gives us permission to listen more, to adjust, to accept, and to find power and strength in different kinds of movement,”cara gilman, yoga instructor, run coach, and founder ofrun yogatellsrunner’s world. not only can yoga support those dealing with period pains, but it also supports a runner’s stride. “yoga bringsmobilityand motion to other areas of the body which helps keepinjuriesaway that are caused by overuse,” gilman adds. what’s more: yoga really helps improve your mind-body connection, which is also pertinent to running."

"mount to coast’s new road shoes are designed for racing hundreds of miles over multiple days. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? new running shoe brand mount to coast has an unconventional mission: to develop betterultramarathonroad shoes. as a marathoner wary of entering an ultra because the terrain is usually not paved roads, i was intrigued by mount to coast’s concept. the brand actually plans on releasing a trail shoe in the future, but its first three models are all for use on pavement. of those three, the r1 was worn by british ultrarunner justin montague when he competed in the little-known mtc jogle, a 17-day ultramarathon during which montague broke the previous course record by 40 hours. he ran a total of 854 miles. and he wore only one pair of r1s. the r1 has no carbon-fiber plate. the foam, lightcell, is peba-based and nitrogen-infused. to combat the foot-swelling that ultrarunners experience when accruing hundreds of miles in the span of a couple of days, the shoe has a dual lacing system that includes a cinch cord similar to “quick lace” designs, which can be easily adjusted to provide more space as the foot swells. mount to coast’s shoe development team saw runners’ toes poking through torn uppers; tunedfit is supposed to prevent this from happening. when i put on theshoes, there really wasn’t anything special to them that indicated they’d last for over 850 miles; the r1 is ultralight (a men’s size 9 weighs only 8.5 ounces). our testers, however, gave the shoe top marks. and as i ran in the r1 through multiple heatwaves, lots of base-building runs, and a couple of long ones with a friend who gushed how much she “loved those shoes,” i could see the allure. it’s a neutral, moderately-cushioned trainer that had me adding in some speedwork on days with 90-plus-degree heat because of the high rebound. in the words of one of our wear-testers, the r1 is “a solid, versatile trainer for all kinds of efforts.” one runner said mount to coast especially nailed the amount of space at the front of the shoe. “i love the toebox! it’s roomy! my bunion feels at peace,” she said, adding that the r1 has become her new go-to daily trainer. “the shoe is light. it’s firm. it’s breathable. i just fell in love.” where the r1 is made for racing hours on end, the s1 is for training or for the everyday grinder; however, itdoeshave ultramarathon cred. at the same mtc jogle montague set a course record at, chinese ultrarunner lucong geng ran 600 miles in a pair of s1s. the shoe isn’t outfitted with a tunedfit dual-lacing system like the r1, but it does share a nitrogen-infused peba midsole and goglow geometry. its moderate cushioning and built-in support provide a solid platform for racking up daily mileage. testers initially felt the s1 was “unremarkable.” and honestly, i had those thoughts too during my first run in the shoe."
"after running in the r1, the s1’s ride felt clunky because it’s heavier. but it wouldn’t be fair to compare a training shoe to its racing counterpart; that would be like pitting the brooks hyperion (a speed shoe) up against the brooks ghost (a daily trainer). “overall, i had no issues with the s1, but the ride felt flat with not a lot of forward propulsion,” said tester gabe franc, whose pace averages 7:30. “i also didn’t gravitate to it for longer distances since the impact was fairly firm, especially compared to other shoes like the asics novablast, which has been my recent favorite go-to pair of shoes for long runs. “i think the s1 is a solid first concept for a line going forward in mount to coast’s lineup,” franc continued. “for its weight and stack height, it is fairly responsive. it feels like a heavy shoe, but the firm outsole gives it a responsive feel. i think the durability and stability are also very good for this shoe. the outsole has shown little wear so far, besides just the white rubber turning black from the asphalt. the stability feels very solid too, even though it isn’t labeled as a stability shoe. i felt like there was extra support keeping everything aligned, which is a strong point for a shoe being ultramarathon-designed.” like franc, other testers highlighted the shoe’s overall comfort and rebound, drawing comparisons to other cushioned trainers like thebrooks glycerin. all of mount to coast’s shoes come with a shoe bag, technology card, and poster. one tester was, to put it mildly, wary of what he found inside his mount to coast shoe box. but he changed his tune once he went out for a run. “upon returning home with my shoes, i looked at the box and i’d never heard of mount to coast shoes. i was a bit skeptical about these shoes,” said tester don kuntzman, who’s tested for rw for almost a decade. “then i opened the box and the first thing i see is a poster and a free shoe bag. and my skepticism was beginning to turn to outright cynicism. who backs free stuff in the box? so my thinking is, ‘these shoes are going to be bad!’ but after several runs i am amazed how good these shoes are. though they’re not for sprinting because it’s hard to get up on your toes. they’re great for training runs and i imagine for ultra distances, which they’re designed for. in the end i’ve run in these shoes everyday since getting them and they are simply fantastic.” the p1, which was released at the end of august, rounds out mount to coast’s growing collection with a plush stability trainer that’s comparable to saucony’s hurricane and brooks’s glycerin gts. instead of placing dense foam on the lateral and medial sides of the foot, like the guide rails found in brooks and altra, mount to coast fused a rail connecting the medial and lateral sides."
"the flexible structure, called a 3d archrail, resembles a tapered road you can visibly see on the bottom of the shoe. the idea behind the 3d archrail is to reduce forefoot abduction (according to mount to coast, most stability shoes have tech placed in the rearfoot area to control pronation) and therefore, decrease injury risk. none of our testers were injured while running in the p1, but that’s pretty standard in the case of testing most of the shoes we give to runners for evaluation. but the common thread among p1 testers was the shoe’s comfort. “one of the most noticeable aspects of the p1 is the comfort level right out of the box,” said tester eric bartosz, who is a heel striker. “the lightcell foam combined with the pliable mesh upper gives the impression that it could be worn all-day long with no complaints. the foam gives optimal cushioning without feeling like a waterbed (sorry nike invincible) and at the same time feels fast and ready to eat up miles for days.” tester renee hislop, who averages 45 miles a week on road, trail, and gravel, took the shoe out for a couple long runs. “i loved everything about these sneakers,” she said. “the cushioning was like a mattress topper foam. you put your foot in the shoe and the cushioning formed around your foot and you never worried about slipping around or blisters. i distinctly remember being at mile 15 of my run and walking into wawa for a gatorade feeling like i was walking on clouds. the comfort of these sneakers was superior. i had my gatorade and kept on running.” buy mtc r1buy mtc s1buy mtc p1 amanda is a test editor at runner’s world who has run the boston marathon every year since 2013; she's a former professional baker with a master’s in gastronomy and she carb-loads on snickerdoodles. the best adidas running shoes for every runner why you should race in the diadora gara carbon october running shoe deals 2024 the best october prime day running shoe deals 2024 find a smooth ride in the adidas ultraboost 5x a new balance shoe for the marathon track star the best running shoes for men find protection on the trails in the altra timp 5 the 6 best treadmill shoes for indoor running the 5 best hiking shoes for 2024 tested and reviewed: altra experience shoes is the brooks glycerin 21 comfier than the 20? a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"add some zest to your carbo-loads with these simple, healthy recipes. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? one of the most satisfying upsides of running—once you’re past all the self-induced struggle that comes with it—is the feeling of voracious hunger after a hard workout. it’s a natural response to putting stress on your body: your tired muscles want to repair themselves, and they need the building blocks to do so quickly. suddenly, anything from a spoonful of peanut butter to cold pizza looks like a gourmet meal. i’ve been there, too, and there’s nothing wrong with housing a slice after a good run—but ultimately, some foods will help yourecover faster, burn fuel more efficiently, andfeel betteron your runs. that meansplanning your nutritionis paramount if you’re looking to get the most out of your training. and if you want to keep things interesting (no shade to the chicken, rice, and frozen broccoli that propelled me through college), a cookbook written specifically for runners may be a critical kitchen companion. whether you’re curious about yourmacronutrientintake, struggling to understand how much to eat, or just looking to add some spice to your training-day dinners, these cookbooks for runners add some extra zing to your fuel. each recipe strikes a stellar balance between healthfulness and indulgence, and some help you work around dietary restrictions like vegan or gluten-free. in other words, it’s possible to thoroughly enjoy eatingandget the most out of your training at the same time, and these cookbooks for runners can help. unless you’re a pro at making substitutions, you’ll find that some diets, such asvegetarianandketogenicdiets, rule out loads of recipes in the average cookbook. but that doesn’t mean you have to miss out on eating good food: there’s a wealth of protein-filled, balanced meals within any given chosen parameters, including dedicated cookbooks stuffed with fresh, inventive recipes. more than anything, these books are a great source for inspiration that doesn’t rely on the norms of non-diet meals. quality cookbooks consist of recipes developed from the ground up, not by modifying an original recipe. this approach can help you perceive your training meals as a choice rather than a compromise—a much-needed morale boost for runners trying a change in diet for the first time. it’s hard to argue that anyone could write a better cookbook than a chef, at least when whipping up something tasty is the sole objective. that said, when athletes write cookbooks, they often frame them around the nutritional makeup of each recipe—macronutrients like carbs and protein, for instance. this may be more important information if you’re, say, figuring out your last dinner before a race. the perfect cookbook for you will take the information you have and give you the information you need. want to know how many fast-burning carbs you can pack into a tasty marinara sauce? look for an athlete-authored book. have a box of protein-rich pasta and no clue what to make with it? try one written by a chef."
"of course, you can also mix and match to maximize your pool of references, or you can look for someone with a bit of both perspectives, like chef-turned-iron mangordon ramsay. there are thousands of cookbooks available online and in bookstores, especially those focused on healthy eating. but many of these books don’t have the information athletes need, many more will try to sell you on an unsustainable fad diet, and lots have only a few good recipes, if any. not ideal if you’re looking for new mainstay meals. we chose these seven cookbooks based on a combination of positive personal experiences, information quality and density, authorial credibility, and recipe variety. to evaluate the cookbooks we don’t have in our own kitchens, we scoured online copies of bestselling cookbooks marketed to athletes, choosing only the most consistently positively reviewed options (and those that we were the most enthusiastic to try as soon as possible). it’s not often that we get an in-depth look at the nutrition plans of world-class athletes—let alone record-setters like shalane flanagan. but for this cookbook, she and chef elyse kopecky collected more than 100 of their favorite recipes for fueling even the most intense distance runs. this book also isn’t shy about the realities of healthy food: it delves into topics like the essential nature of fat as a flavor enhancer and a well-rounded diet, the importance of avoiding restrictive diets, and the triviality of stressing about numbers. they also include a recipe for some damn good chocolate cookies, which is always a plus. vegetarian and vegan diets don’t have to be the lesser siblings of omnivorous diets; in many cases, when you get them right, they can be even better. but because you don’t have a big cut of meat holding up your meal in terms of protein, it can take a more holistic approach to give plant-based recipes depth and character. this cookbook from matt frazier and stepfanie romine has that approach dialed. this book has creative takes on traditional favorites, like savory chickpea waffles, as well as fresh recipes for staples like morning smoothies. and not only are the recipes in this book fit for any time of day, but they also come jam-packed with info about how to further modify each dish for gluten- and soy-free athletes. nobody’s tastes are left out here except for, well, meat-eaters. but that’s the point! not everyone may be aware, but gordon ramsay has plenty of authority to write about food that fuels athletes: he’s a serious triathlete when he’s not in the kitchen, and he’s even finished the kona ironman. just a few years after his big kona finish, he wrote this book with three distinct sections—healthy, lean, and fit—to cater to different health-related goals. healthy helps you find a stable diet for an energized everyday life, lean features recipes for people with weight loss goals, and fit is dedicated to pre- and post-workout meals that fuel your workouts and aid in recovery."
"one of the tougher things you’ll have to navigate with this book is ramsay’s tendency to use exotic (or at least exotically phrased) ingredients. if the produce section at your local grocery store is a little lacking, you might struggle to try some recipes without swapping in substitutes. additionally, be on the lookout for ramsay’s use of british lingo—a courgette is a zucchini, for example. keto diets are especially finicky, at least when you’re trying to develop yours from scratch. entering ketosis requires eating as few carbs as possible, and those can sneak into almost everything the average person eats. to take the guesswork out of staying low-carb, save yourself from another slab of bacon or provolone and try this cookbook. it aims to guide you progressively into a sustainable keto diet instead of thrusting you away from your comfort foods overnight. this book isn’t necessarily written for athletes, but it sets a foundation for a well-rounded keto diet that can adapt with you and your life. keto isn’t quite everyone’s thing, but if you want to see if it’s yours, this book is the most approachable means of trying it properly. you may knowsalt, fat, acid, heatfrom its accompanying netflix documentary that released in 2018—it’s an in-depth interrogation of the very fundamentals of good food and what makes us enjoy it. just like the four-part series, this book tells you how to make any dish good by finding the perfect balance of salt, a flavor enhancer; fat, a texture enhancer; acid, a flavor balancer; and heat, a texture balancer. this book is a stellar addition to your collection if you’re looking to create some recipes from scratch, and it’ll also give you more confidence to modify recipes that are really close to being good but seem to be missing something. this also isn’t explicitly a cookbook for runners, but if you know what food makes you run your best, this book will help you put it all together in a way that tastes amazing. if you likerun fast. eat slow.but feel like the recipes leave you crunched for time, then this second book from flanagan and kopecky should give you what you need. just like the original, this cookbook for runners is full of hearty recipes that can power you and your family through a big training day, but they take much less time to prepare. if you work full-time and train in the evenings, this book could save your sanity. another book for the plant-based athletes among us,eat & runisn’t actually a cookbook. it’s a memoir containing just a dozen recipes. it chronicles the life of author scott jurek as he transitioned from a meat-heavy diet in his youth to a vegan diet that fueled much of his ultrarunning career. if you’re a fan of food that tells a story, the recipes embedded within the story may be right for you."
"otherwise, this book is simply a great motivator for athletes struggling to find a diet that works for them, and it’s a poignant read about grappling with family traditions and inviting novel ideas into one’s lifestyle. adam schram is an assistant editor of commerce atrunner's world, though you might see his byline onbicyclingandpopular mechanics, too. a lover of all things outdoors, adam's writing career comes after six years as a bike mechanic in his hometown of state college, pa. his journalism experience is steeped in cycling and running gear reviews, and he's also a published creative nonfiction and satire author. when he's not writing, riding, or running, you can catch adam at home mixing cocktails, watchingstar wars,or trying in vain to do the sunday crossword. you can check out his latest work below. why it’s important to avoid running through injury all about running tests for improved performance how to boost your one-mile calorie burn how to run with knee arthritis and reduce the pain how to train like david roche why do my ears hurt when i run in the cold? how to deal with period cramps during training what is a healthy body fat percentage? anabolic vs. catabolic metabolism and running do you go to the bathroom enough? are you drinking water wrong? why do i sweat so much? a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"according to research, you probably are. here’s how to make sure your water intake improves your performance. stayinghydratedseems simple enough—drink water when you’rethirstyand stop when you feel like you’re done, right? well, it’s a bit more complicated than that, especially forrunners. that’s because not understanding the complicated equation of race distance and intensity combined with water and electrolyte intake can ruin along runorrace, not to mention have serious health repercussions. drink too little and your ability to power through your workout suffers; drink too much and you can get sidelined bynauseaand frequentpee breaks. and even though you might first worry about dehydration for those summer runs,researchersfound that the newer you are to running and the slower you run, the more likely it is that you will drinktoo muchwater while racing. (we’ll talk more about this later.) to that end, much of the research demonstrates that mastering the art of hydration when you run isn’t as simple as it seems. keep reading to find out if you drink water the wrong way—and how to drink water right. it’s okay to slow a little to make sure you’re getting in your fluids during a race, but gulping water at each aid station can ultimately slow you down and also lead to an upset stomach. that’s because drinking too much water too quickly overloads the stomach, causing it to rapidly stretch. this can lead to discomfort and potential nausea,justin mullner, m.d., a board-certified primary care sports physician with the orlando health jewett orthopedic institute in florida tellsrunner’s world. take small sips of water (or electrolyte drink) every 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the temperature and intensity of the run. combining a run with too much water is even more likely to cause nausea. that’s becauseintense exercisedirects blood flow away from the stomach and toward themuscles, causing digestion to slow down. “so you put a bunch of water in there and thestomachreally can’t handle it effectively and efficiently,” mullner says. a better strategy is to take small sips of water (or electrolyte drink) every 15 to 20 minutes, depending on thetemperatureand intensity of the run. “this approach helps maintain a steady level of hydration and prevents the stomach from becoming overly full,”meghan kennihan, a rrca- and usatf-certified running coach, tellsrunner’s world. your trustywater bottleis always there when you need it. sadly, constant use means you’re probably getting more than water. unless you regularly clean your water bottle—which means daily according to mullner—you could be getting a dose of bacteria or even mold. every time you put your mouth to the water bottle and use your hands to open and close it, you transfer bacteria that can make its way inside. the moist environment inside your water bottle provides an optimal breeding ground for bacteria and mold, especially if you live inhot, humidareas. if left unchecked, the bacteria and mold can continue growing, potentially causing you to experience symptoms similar tofood poisoning(such as stomach pain or cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting), per thecenters for disease control and prevention."
"people with mold sensitivities can have a flare-up of allergy symptoms. ideally, you’d wash out yourreusable bottle—whether plastic, stainless steel, or glass—with soap and warm water each time, mullner says. “it’s even more important if you’re using the bottle every single day or drinking beverages other than water,” he says. mixingelectrolyte powdersor adding a sports drink to your bottle, for example, means more material for bacteria. signs your bottle could use a good scrubbing include visible residue, a funny or foul odor, or changes in how things taste, mullner says. when preparing for a long run or race, many runners forget to hydrate until they’re practically toeing thestarting line, “which is a bad idea because it doesn’t give the body enough time to absorb and utilize the fluids,” kennihan says. staying well-hydrated in the days leading up to your long run or race can help you perform well, avoid feeling overly full, and reduce restroom stops. be especially diligent about drinking water starting the day before a long run orrace, and check your urine color to be sure you’re getting enough. “really dark yellow is a sign that you’re not well-hydrated,” mullner says. “ideally, it has a slight tinge of yellow.” drink 16 to 20 ounces of water about 2 to 3 hours beforehand and then another 8 to 10 ounces 20 to 30 minutes before running. individual fluid needs vary. however, a general guideline for the day of the event is to drink 16 to 20 ounces of water about 2 to 3 hours beforehand and then another 8 to 10 ounces 20 to 30 minutes before running, kennihan says. you may need to adjust your intake according to your body size, run distance, and outside temperature. it’s critical to drink enough water during long training runs and races. however, drinking lots of water, andonlywater, can lead tooverhydration, meaning you have too much water in your body. hyponatremia is an extreme version of overhydration, and occurs when sodium levels in the blood are lower than recommended, leading to muscle cramps, headaches, nausea and vomiting, low energy, and confusion, per thecleveland clinic. normally, your body keeps your electrolytes in balance by taking the minerals from the foods you eat and filtering the excess through your urine. however, intense exercise causes electrolytes (particularly sodium) to be quickly lost throughsweat, and hot, humid temperatures only accelerate this loss, per theamerican college of sports medicine. it's not just new runners who tend to overhydrate. at the other end of the spectrum, 41 out of 63 finishers at an ultramarathon also finished with mild or severe hyponatremia, according to a 2019frontiers in nutritionstudy. take in electrolytes in addition to water if you’re running for longer than 60 minutes or in hot, humid temperatures. drinking water without replacing electrolytes dilutes the remaining electrolytes (again,sodiumin particular) in your blood. “you can potentially get yourself into trouble with hyponatremia,” mullner says. to prevent an electrolyte imbalance, take in electrolytes in addition to water if you’rerunning for longerthan 60 minutes or in hot, humid temperatures."
"bring an electrolyte drink, some gels, or another electrolyte supplement. sports drinksoffer a convenient delivery system for carbs and electrolytes while running. still, many runners prefer to water things down. “many sports drinks are too concentrated, leading to stomach cramps and nausea. diluting them can still provide the necessary electrolytes andcarbohydrateswithout overwhelming the stomach,” kennihan notes. the optimal ratio of sports drink to water depends on your preferences and the makeup of your drink. mullner suggests diluting your sports drink to the point where it’s most palatable for you. diluting sports drinks can still provide the necessary electrolytes and carbohydrates without overwhelming the stomach. the exception: don’t dilute a sports drink that contains carbohydrates if you’re using it for energy purposes. “some sports drinks have carbs in there to help extend the amount of time you can perform, and if you’re trying to absorb carbs better, you would have it with some electrolytes,” mullner says. adding water can cut down on how many carbs you get per sip, limitingperformancebenefits. some over-the-counter and prescription medications can affect an athlete’s hydration, says kennihan. nsaids, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, can reduce blood flow to the kidneys, which can impair their ability to conserve water and electrolytes, potentially leading to dehydration, especially during prolonged physical activity like running. similarly, diuretics, which are prescribed for conditions such as hypertension and edema, increase urine production and promote the excretion of water and electrolytes from the body. increased urine output can lead to a significant loss of fluids and electrolytes, making it easier for runners to become dehydrated, particularly in hot and humid conditions or during long-distance runs. likewise, antihistamines can reduce saliva production and increase the risk of dry mouth and dehydration, while laxatives can cause increased bowel movements and fluid loss. lastly, stimulant medications, such as those used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), can increase sweating and fluid loss, potentially leading to dehydration if fluid intake is not adequately maintained. bottom line:as a runner, remember that hydration is as much a part of your performance as actual time on your feet. the authors of a 2019 article published in theinternational journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolismrecommended that runners develop a “personalized and practiced race plan” to optimize their fluid and carbohydrate intake based not only on their distance and intensity, but also taking into account their body composition, as well as theweatherand other race conditions, such asrefueling stations, at each event. lauren bedosky is a freelance health and fitness writer who specializes in covering running and strength training topics. she writes for a variety of national publications, includingrunner’s world,prevention, experience lifeandwomen’s running. why it’s important to avoid running through injury all about running tests for improved performance how to boost your one-mile calorie burn how to run with knee arthritis and reduce the pain how to train like david roche why do my ears hurt when i run in the cold? how to deal with period cramps during training what is a healthy body fat percentage?"

"maybe you should dial back your training for better performance. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? in august 2024, elite runner david roche shocked the ultra world and crossed the finish line first at theleadville 100 race. he also shattered matt carpenter’s storied 2005 leadville 100 course record. roche finished in15:26:34, while carpenter had finished in 15:42. roche’s win and time caught people off guard because it was his first go at the distance, even though he has a long career in the ultrarunning by doing 50ks and 50 milers. even more surprising, though, was roche’s approach to training for the 100-mile race: 10 hours a week, versus that of most of his competitors who typically train 25-plus hours per week. roche also wears many other hats: coach to other runners, host with his wife,megan, on the podcastsome work all play, and father to a toddler. like many everyday runners, roche, 36, must catch his training where he can, which means he must make the most of it. “in the process of going through life and doing what i can, i realized that this is also what worked best for me,” roche tellsrunner’s world. “life istraining, too, and ‘life miles’ are not accounted for enough in what leads to adaptation.” if you can relate to this struggle, you will be reassured to know that by following some key principles, you can still reach finish lines and hit lofty goals. “there are many ways to get to your end goal,”lara rogers, coach for the under armour mission run team tellsrunner’s world. “what works for one person might not work for another. i’ve coached plenty ofrunnerswho thrive on lower volume.” david and megan roche put extensive research into their training, as well as that of their clients. their numerous accomplishments validate their knowledge. david roche is the 2014 usatftrail runnerof the year at the sub-ultra distance, and a two-time national champion and three-time member of team usa in duathlon. megan roche is the 2016 usatf trail runner of the year at the ultra and sub-ultra distances. she is a five-time national champion, a north american mountain running champion, and a six-time member of team usa. she graduated with honors from duke with a degree in neuroscience and received her m.d. from stanford medical school. at stanford, she also earned a ph.d. in epidemiology, focused on female athlete health and performance research. in 2024, she launchedhuzzah, sharing female athlete performance science. in the episode “what just happened” of their podcast, they break down all the science that went into preparing david roche for—and helping him get through—this extraordinary accomplishment. as they explain in the intro to their debriefing, a lot has changed in training and performance since 2005 when carpenter broke his record, including advancements infueling,shoes, andaltitude science. here are three keys to making the most of your training, no matter how much time you have in your weekly schedule."
"if you’re dialing back to just a few runs each week, what’s key is making the most of those miles. “typically, that would look like onelong run, and two sessions that are a bitfaster,” says rogers. “what’s most important is that you’reconsistent, week after week.” according to roche, there are too many performance variables in ultras to be sure of what intervention leads to what outcome, so training simply to run farther may not be the best strategy. “the strongest predictive variable of ultra performances in the few studies on the subject is velocity at vo2 max,” roche explains. “so even though i’m training for an event that lasts all day, i want to make sure that i develop my pure speed and running economy all the way to race day. when there are hundreds of variables we can’t control, vo2 might be one variable that has an outsized impact on all-day endurance performance given how it is related to performance at lower effort levels, too.” according touniversity of california health, vo2 max is an important standard for measuring aerobic fitness. the number describes “the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during incremental exercise.” in essence, the higher your vo2 max, the better your athletic performance, although other factors, such as sustainable lactate threshold, motivation, and training are important factors in the process. therefore, while roche doesn’t put in the mega miles of his competitors, he does keepspeedand other run styles in his routine. “i’ll incorporatestridesthree or four times a week, usually up hills, and sometimes on flats to keep my nervous system responding,” he explains. “i’ll also do afartlekworkout, usually doing 60- or 90-second intervals. my goal was to come into leadville as fast as possible in a 5k sense.” ➡ it works for marathons, toosimilarly, consistency, not volume, has worked for 53-year-old lili barouch, a maryland-based cardiologist and parent. barouch began running in 2006 for fitness, but soon caught the bug to race, working her way up to themarathonby 2009. she eventually qualified forbostonby running just three days a week. “i haverheumatoid arthritis, so i’ve always been careful about my mileage,” she explains. “early on, i went through several injuries, and i tied them to running consecutive days—it just didn’t work for me.”through some trial and error, barouch devised a “less is more” plan that worked for her. during three-days-a-week marathon training, that means a peak period of one long run that never exceeds 50 percent of her weekly mileage, and two others in the range of about seven and nine miles.“when i was working toward my bq, i’d pick one day to run sometempo, and one day for somespeed workorhill repeats,” barouch explains. she also includes step-back weeks. every fourth week or so, she cuts her overall volume by 25 percent to give her body a break from her higher mileage weeks. roche kept long runs in the equation, too, but dialed those back from the typical ultra-training mileage. “i didn’t go beyond 20 very often,” he says."
"“when i did, it was with purpose.” to that end, roche focused a lot ondownhills.“the primary adaptation that is unique to long ultras with vert (altitude) is the demand of eccentric muscle contractions from downhills,” he explains. “on my key long runs, i emphasized doing downhills that are as steep as the steepest i’d see on race day at faster paces than i’d do them on race day. at first, i’d be sore for five days from these runs, as thedelayed-onset muscle sorenesswas extreme and my blood was full of creatine kinase from muscle breakdown. but the “repeated bout effect” from studies indicates that it only takes a few of these steep downhill stimuli to adapt, so i wanted to harness that without overdoing stress on my body.” rogers says bothcross-trainingand strength training are key to success, especially if you work a desk job and spend a good deal of time sitting. “go through a basiccore routinethat focuses on yourhipsandglutesa couple times a week,” she recommends. in fact, one of the athletes rogers coaches placed third at ncaa nationals this year on low mileage. “she supplemented with swimming and beat people running three times as much as her,” rogers explains. lili barouch, 53, also makes cross-training andstrength trainingpart of her regimen for marathon training on lower total mileage. “i also do triathlons, so i’m naturally getting into the pool or on my bike every week,” she explains. “but i also make sure i’m strength training twice a week.” one of these sessions is an hour long, while the other is usually around 30 minutes. the basics count, too. from goodnutritionand hydration, to rest and easy movement to encouragerecovery, consider these “extras” as essentials. “i always fuel my training, which matters for performance,” says roche. to that point, while roche didn’t always put in the long miles when he trained, he did study the science for his fueling technique. he details his “slurping” technique of up to 120 grams of carbs (not to mention caffeine intake) in thisinstagrampost. rogers points out the value in these smaller details. “you can spend all the time and money you want on fancyrecovery tools, but they will deliver little benefit,” she says. “if you’re not covering the basics, it doesn’t matter.”the basics, according to rogers, are warmups, cooldowns, nutrition, and recovery. rochepays attention to whether he’s recovering from his efforts and if not, he dials back his training even more. “i use the midnightpeetest,” he says. “if i wake up and limp to the bathroom like a 97-year-old, i’m playing the numbers game wrong.” by putting all the pieces together, your minimalisttrainingcan add up to maximum results—look no farther than roche to see that proof. “get creative in the context of your life,” he says."

"we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? keep running. keep drinking. keep going. you don’t have to be a professional athlete to understand that proper hydration is essential to your health and running performance. wearing a hydration pack–usually a vest or small backpack with holsters forwater bottles, a large reservoir, or both–ensures you stay hydrated on long runs and lets you sip without losing your stride. it's especially helpful forultramarathonsandtrail runs, where you won’t likely have easy access to water along the way. the best hydration packs are great for short runs too, though: there’s no need to lose momentum if you can drink and run at the same time. some also have storage for carrying your phone, keys, fuel, and other essentials, eliminating the scourge of bouncing short pockets. thirsty? check out these hydration stories:best running belts●best hydration powders●watch out for these dehydration symptoms in hot weather bottles and reservoirs expert recommendations vary widely when it comes to exactly how much water you should drink while running, but when all is said and done, it typically comes down todrinking when you’re thirsty. most hydration packs come with or can accommodate a pair of water bottles, usually around 17 ounces apiece, which should keep most people hydrated for at least a couple of hours. larger packs often include a sleeve for a large, soft-bodied water pouch called a reservoir or bladder, which has a hose that runs out of the pack and connects at your shoulder, where there’s a nozzle for easy on-the-go sipping. a standard 3 liter (101 oz) reservoir will give you another four to five hours, though long-distance runners may try to stretch that out over a much longer period. storage vs. weight hydration packs, generally speaking, fall into two categories. there are lighter “minimalist” hydration vests designed to be as light as possible, holding no more than a pair of water bottles and a small pocket’s worth of storage at most. these are perfect if you’re going to wear a pack on a short run or to a race. for non-competitive long-distance runs andtrail running, there are also larger hydration packs that offer a fair amount of physical storage. in addition to room for water, they often have pockets and hoops for extra clothing, trekking poles, and any other gear you might want to carry along the way. in either case, you can usually count on having small pockets on the shoulder straps for gels, a phone, and other small necessities. keep in mind that water and gear are heavy, and the more you carry, the harder you must work when running. that’s probably worth it in the long run, as you can’t perform if you aren’t hydrated and properly equipped. but if you only plan on going for short to medium runs, you likely don’t need the added weight of excesssive cargo or a reservoir and can get by with water bottles just fine."
"comfort most hydration packs offer highly adjustable back and cross-body straps that, along with other fitting elements, help you tailor a snug but comfortable fit that hugs your body without bouncing or shifting. they also typically feature vented panels and lightweight fabrics that wick away moisture and dry quickly. some are minimalist while others have significantly more backpack-like coverage, which may be more or less comfortable depending on the individual. most hydration packs are unisex garments, though some manufacturers make hydration packs specifically for women, which can feature cross-body straps tailored to fit around a wider range of chest sizes. as a lifelong trail running enthusiast with a penchant for water, i’ve been using hydration vests and packs for decades. this firsthand experience was bolstered by testing a slew of the latest releases from all the top brands, and by input and testing from therunner’s worldeditorial team, which evaluated and put these hydration packs through their paces. in addition to running them through a variety of street and trail routes, we researched the latest features and hydration science and surveyed user reviews on amazon and other retailers to find the packs that the distance running community loves. only the models with the best value, technical features, comfort, looks, and ability to haul all your stuff without bouncing made the cut. the salomon adv skin 5 does pretty much everything right. it fits well on both men and women, with front and side compression bungees to reduce bouncing and soft padding that minimizes chafing. it comes with a pair of 17-ounce strap flasks, which allow you to carry enough water for a moderate-length run lasting under two hours. there’s an internal reservoir sleeve as well, so you can add an extra 34-102 ounces (1-3 liters) across all three vessels. it also features six stretchy mesh pockets, giving you plenty of room to stash valuables, a running jacket, and any other small accessories you might want to bring along on a run. while it could use a smidge better ventilation, for our money this is the best hydration pack out there. for less than $100, the nathan trailmix is a surprisingly high quality pack. it can carry both water bottles and a 2-liter reservoir, and while you have to supply your own bottles, the bladder is included. there is a fairly large, zipping storage pocket to the rear plus a smaller one at the bottom of the right shoulder strap, and several carabiner clip points along the spine. while it has a fair amount of coverage, the material is breathable and lightweight, clocking in at just 7 ounces without the reservoir. i wore one through a number of hot trail runs and never once felt like it was too hot or heavy. the fit is snug and comfortable, generally speaking, though the chest straps do have a tendency to work loose as you run. all told, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a vest that offers so much at such a reasonable price."
"having scoured the world for the lightest hydration vest possible, i can report that this is as close to weightless as it gets without compromising essential features. the size large weighs in at just 7 ounces, which is particularly light when you consider that it’s still reservoir-compatible. it also includes two 17-ounce flasks with a unique leash system that allows you to retract them back into place quickly while on the go. there are even a couple of zipping pockets and slots for gels. one thing to keep in mind: when your vest is this light, it tends to bounce a bit more than the average pack. even with that extra movement, though, the fit is adjustable and stays comfortable mile after mile. small and sleek, the nathan quickstart 2.0 is made for intense short-to-medium distance runs. its comfortable, lightweight design features, outstanding ventilation, and reliable moisture-wicking will help to keep you cool and dry. it comes with a 50-ounce reservoir, and has strap pockets that allow you to add a pair of extra 22-ounce water bottles. while it offers five pockets of various sizes for fuel, keys, and other small items, its non-liquid storage capacity feels limited compared to our other picks. since you probably don’t want to carry much during a race, we think that makes it a perfect fit for competition. the further into the backcountry your trail run brings you, the more stuff you’ll need to bring along. the distance 4 vest from black diamond gives you lots of storage space forenergy gelsand other gear. it has a special easy-access holster forhiking poles, and a zip-up security pocket in the back to hold your keys and cards. the design is well-ventilated and fits snugly around your torso. there’s a sleeve for an optional bladder if you want to add one; between that and the two included 17-ounce soft flasks, you’ll be able to carry more than enough water to get you out of the woods. the ultimate direction xodus features a maximalist design that caters specifically to ultramarathoners. it comes equipped with everything you could possibly need on the trail, including nine perfectly placed storage pockets on the front and two large pockets on the back. it has the capacity to hold two 17-ounce bottles and a 51-ounce reservoir. the customizable trekking pole hoops allow you to adjust to your preferred placement. reflective elements boost low-light visibility, and the fit is perfectly snug with no bounce. despite offering so much, the vest is incredibly light and breathable. it almost feels like wearing a minimalist vest. the cut is short, minimizing weight and skin coverage. there’s so much vest to it, but it never feels that way no matter how many miles you’ve run. if you’re looking for a hydration pack for a more leisurely hike, check out the lagos from cotopaxi. it’s got plenty of storage, with a 1.5-liter cargo area with interior organizer and several exterior pockets, mesh stashes, and clips."
"it carries a custom 2.5 l reservoir and has a sleeve that can hold a 22-ounce water bottle. the shoulder harness is ventilated and comfortable enough for hours of hiking, and there are straps at the chest and hips for a more secure fit. the lagos is also offered in a range of cotopaxi’s characteristically eye-catching colors and, what’s more, it’s made using the brand’s comparatively sustainable, ethical production process so you can feel good about wearing it. how should a hydration pack fit? when adjusting your hydration pack before a run, you want to make sure it’s tight enough to fit snuggly against your torso so that it won’t bounce, without tightening to the point where it pinches or chafes. do i need to wear a shirt if i’m wearing a hydration pack? not necessarily. most hydration packs will fit nicely with or without a shirt, so it’s entirely up to you. a tight-fitting shirt can minimize chafing, though some people find that the added layer adds unwanted rubbing. if you aren’t sure what you prefer, try both and see what works for you. it’s worth keeping in mind that many hydration packs offer enough storage that you can stop and take off your shirt mid-run if you start to feel uncomfortable. how much cargo should you carry on a long run? the longer and more difficult your route, the more important it is to carry water, fuel, poles, emergency supplies, and other gear. that said, you should generally try to stay as light as possible on a long run. it’s going to take some trial and error before you dial in your perfect cargo load. do not skimp on supplies if you’re pushing yourself on a longer run. lightweight is great, but you don’t want to find yourself dangerously unprepared. nick hilden is a writer, globetrotter, and jack-of-many-talents who has written gear reviews for the likes ofrunner’s world,popular science,men’s health,thrillist,the daily beast,the los angeles times,greatist, andthe manual, and his lifestyle, culture, and tech writing has also appeared inscientific american,afar,salon,vice,healthline, and many others. before entering journalism some 15 years ago, he worked as a bartender, brewery manager, sound engineer, recording and touring musician, cook, teacher, and in a variety of other trades. these days, he lives all over the world, performs music sporadically, and spends a lot of time thinking how to best improve his honda element conversion."

"if you get to the end of a race and want to keep going, you may be ready for an ultramarathon. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? courtney dauwalter had an extraordinary 2023—she was the first athlete to winwestern states 100,hardrock 100and the ultra-trail du mont-blanc (utmb) in the same year—those races are ultramarathons—each just over 100 miles. feel inspired by greats like dauwalter or your running friend who casually runs ultras for fun? great! you will likely be happy to know that dauwalter is not aggressive about her training. keep that in mind and maybe you, too, can run an ultramarthon. the number of runners taking on ultras is on the rise. in fact, more than 611,000 runners participated in ultras in 2020, according toa surveyfrom runrepeat and theinternational association of ultrarunners. as you can imagine, finding alocationto run 100 miles can be a challenge, and that’s one reason most ultramarathons areoff-road. also, because they take so long, there are pre-dawn start times, too, and, yes, they take a long time—dauwalter’s record-setting western states run took over 15 hours. how long does it take the averagerunner? somewhere between 24 and 36 hours. with so few participants and such a long time on the course, one thing ultramarathoners notice is a lot of camaraderie in their sport. “the vibe on the course is super-friendly and supportive. often, it feels like a progressive dinner party under the stars as you move from aid station to station with yourpacers,crew, and newly made friends,” susie crossland-dwyer, an ultrarunner, coach, and founder ofstudio s, a strength, pilates, and run coaching studio in cincinnati tellsrunner’s world. she’s coached runners, including ultrarunners, for more than 15 years and in 2017, ran six mountain ultramarathons on five continents. “i often find myself thinking of ultramarathoning as a different sport thanroad runningbecause the focus of most athletes is altogether different,” crossland-dwyer adds. “the community and non-competitive element of ultrarunning tends to be front and center.” sounds pretty welcoming when you put it that way. keep reading for more about what exactly makes ultrarunning unique and how to prep for anultramarathon. an ultramarathon is any distance longer than amarathon—26.2 miles. some popular races are 100 miles while others are 200-plus miles over multiple days. the shortest traditional ultramarathon is50k, or 31 miles. that’s a great place to start if you’re a marathoner looking to dip your toes in the ultrarunning water, says don reichelt, who has placed first in races like the 2019 lean horse 100 and the 2022 coldwater rumble 52 miler; his personal best in the 100-miler is 13:16:55 (that’s an average 7:58 per mile pace). the biggest difference betweenultramarathonsand traditional marathons is the complexity of the training schedule, says reichelt, and that most ultras aretrail-based. if you’re interested in tackling an ultramarathon, you’ve likely crossed the finish line of at least one, if not several,marathons—and that’s very important. so is progressing tolonger distancesgradually."
"“i encourage athletes to have a few seasons ofmarathon runningunder their belt before jumping to ultra-distances, and i like to see athletes sequentially increase their training volume ormileageover multiple seasons when moving from the marathon to ultras,” says crossland-dwyer. “this aids withinjury preventionand helps athletes learn how to handle multiple hours of running before layering on new elements liketrail-running technique, varied terrain, elevation gain and loss, andaltitude.” another significant part of making sure you’re ready to take on an ultra is to start preppingmentally, and a good place to start is on the sidelines of an ultramarthon. “for someone new to ultras, the first thing you should do is volunteer to crew, pace, or work an aid station at an ultramarathon,”mark wooten,life timerun coach and ultrarunner who’s done races like the badwater ultra tellsrunner’s world. you’ll understand how importantmental toughnessand a solid race strategy are to finishing an ultramarathon. ultras may sound like a totally different beast than themarathon—and they are—but training for one isn’t all that different. “don’t expect to spend four times the amount of hours training for a 100-miler because it’s four times as long as a standard marathon,” says wooten. “in terms of training time, amarathon planand an ultramarathon plan would generally be about the same amount of weekly hours. the big misconception to clear would be the idea that training would be proportional to distance.” that being said, thetype of runningyou do will shift somewhat. there may be some back-to-backlong runson consecutive days to prep your body to run ontired legs, though you don’t need to do that every week. wooten says there’s varying schools of thought regarding twolong runsper week. “some runners and coaches swear by them and have success this way,” he says. “for my personal training plans, i subscribe to the school of thought ofquality over quantity, and one long run per week is sufficient.” figuring out what works best for you might take some trial and error in training. you might not incorporatespeedworkevery week, or if you do, the paces will be less aggressive (no sprint repeats necessary when you’re training to cover 50 or 100 miles). “the biggest shift most marathoners have to make when transitioning to ultras is not focusing as much on standardtraining pacesbut getting more acquainted with running comfortably,” says crossland-dwyer. any speedwork you do will also be longer. “for an ultrarunner, timing a5kor10kcould count as speedwork as it would still be significantly faster than race pace,” says wooten, who says the goal of speedwork during ultra training is just to make race pace feel more sustainable over those long miles. yourtraining plancan and should vary a lot, depending on what race you’re prepping for and what the terrain will be like. if your race is ontrails, you should aim to go off-road for at least one run per week. and if the course is mountainous, practicing similar changes inelevationduring training is also a smart move, crossland-dwyer says."
"when you domove to the trails, don’t be disappointed if you can’t maintain your regular on-road pace; most runners slow down by 20 to 30 percent or even more when moving to trails, she adds. also, make a point of getting in regularstrengthandmobility training, advises reichelt, who does at least a few minutes ofstrength trainingmost days. “ultrarunning can and will highlight any weaknesses or asymmetries in your body,” he says. “basicbodyweight strength trainingand regularmobilitywork can help keep those issues away.” finally, it’s important to note that because most people who run ultramarathons have a strong running base and regularly clock long miles, an ultramarathon training plan is much less structured. “training duration is one area where the typical marathoner versus the typical ultramarathoner differ in the greatest of ways.marathon training plansare much more rigid and analytical versus ultramarathon plans that are loose with lots of flexibility,” wooten says. “flexible training plansare also further supported because, for most ultramarathoners, a finish is a win.seconds don’t matter as much, and themental strengthto finish has more value than physical strength.” “for ultras, we’re generally running at aneasier pace; therefore, ourstride lengthisn’t as long, which means less ground impact force,” wooten explains. “we’re also incorporating walks into our weekly mileage, which are naturallylower impact, and we typically do a large portion of our mileage on a softer dirt surface that’s much more forgiving than concrete.” this schedule, terrain, and intensity allows for some built-in recovery for your ultramarathon training, which can help you sidestepinjury. but you’re still running very long distances, so you need yourrest timeto live up to your mileage. that means you can consider training for an ultra as your hall pass to soak upallthe r&r.massages,foam rolling, and getting plenty ofquality sleepare all important for helping your body bounce back from all the miles. don’t skip out onactive recovery, either, like arestorative yogaclass, easy-paced bike ride, or swim in an extra-cold pool. “those will all pay big dividends in arriving to the starting line feeling strong,” says wooten. while there isn’t tons of research on the prevalence of injuries among ultramarathoners, studies do suggest they may be more prone to injuries than their shorter distance running counterparts. onesystematic review and meta-analysispublished in 2015 found that ultramarathoners had a mid-event injury rate of more than 65 percent, while marathoners had a mid-race injury rate of just under 8 percent. however, onestudyfound that ultrarunners who do single-day events, like a 65k race, are more prone to injuries, compared to those doing multi-day events. the researchers speculate this is because those single-day runners are more likely to hold aggressive paces. these stats just reiterate the importance ofrecovery, easy-day paces,slow mileage buildup, and paying attention to how your body feels during training. fueling up to get through more miles than a marathon is a crucial element of ultras, and one that’s very tricky to figure out. “finding the right balance of fueling over eight, 12, or 24-plus hours is an art form,” says crossland-dwyer."
"“many athletes’stomachsfail them long before their legs give out.” you’ve perfected your ideal mix of gels and gummies to get you through 26.2 miles, but 50 or 100? don’t even try to cover that distance with nothing butelectrolytecandies in your pocket. those simply won’t supply enough energy to get you to the finish line, and your stomach likely won’t tolerate them for hours upon hours. as a general rule, aim to eat something every 30 minutes and sipsports drinkor something with calories constantly, suggests wooten. a good place to start is alternating some sports gummies or gels with “real” food from aid stations: ultra courses are stocked with everything from pretzels and grilled cheese tochicken broth, noodles, soda, and more. plus, says wooten, before the race you can drop off your own bags with any special items you think you might want to down at various points throughout the course. “the pace is so aggressive in a marathon that quick andsimple sugarsare the only way to keep up with the demand. in an ultra, because of the slower pace, the calorie-per-minute burn is not as steep and theheart rateis so far fromanaerobicthat body fat is helping to supply some of the caloric demand,” wooten explains. “fats,starches, andgrainsbecome the go-to fuels over simple sugars.” as with marathon training, you want to practice your ultrarunningnutrition strategyduring your training so you get used to eating these new foods on the go and also test what works best for your body and gut before race day. “the best way to learn [how to run an] ultra is to get out there, try things, and limit the mistakes each additional time you go out byjournalingthe good and bad during each run,” says reichelt. but there are a couple things that set any ultramarathon race day apart from shorter distances. for one, many ultras start before dawn to give runners time to finish by a set cut-off time—so you may berunning in the darkfor a good chunk of time. also, know that many races have multiple time cut-offs throughout the race, notes crossland-dwyer, which means you have to hit certain mile markers at a certain time. if you hope to run competitively in an ultra, keep in mind that you’ll likely need to run by feel or byheart raterather than sticking to onegoal pacefor the majority of the race, she says: “in order to do well, competitive ultrarunners will say, ‘i don’t necessarily need to run the fastest—i just need to slow down the slowest.’” there’s a lot you can prepare for leading up to an ultra, but at the end of the day, says reichelt, you should prepare to be surprised. “i’ve run countless ultras and run over 100 miles 13 times now, and i’m still learning new things tooptimize my own performance,” he says. “the only thing that doesn’t surprise me anymore is that something will go wrong during an ultra—and your ability to overcome it will determine your results.” learning from each ultra race you run will inform what you do at the next one."
"consider yourprerace ritual,pacingover the course of the mileage, tacklinghills, your food andfluid intake—paying attention to all of these variables can lead to a better ultra your next time at the starting line. but what surprised reichelt most after his first ultra? the people. “nearly everyone is kind and wants to see you succeed,” he says. so even if you’re nervous about lining up to the start of your first ultramarathon, know there will be plenty of people out there to support you. the 5 best hiking shoes for 2024 the best trail running gear the 8 best headlamps for runners running shoe labor day sale 2024 tested and reviewed: nnormal kjerag the best trail running shoes a guide to trail running for beginners adidas enters the trail super shoe war runner’s world shoe awards 2024 - trail shoes tested and reviewed: altra timp 5 trail running tips for beginners and experts tested and reviewed: topo athletic mt-5 a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"successful runners keep competing by adapting and reinventing themselves at each age milestone. running, it is often said, is a lifelong sport. you can start as early as grade school and keep going as long as you can put one foot in front of the other. you grow, mature, set prs and (hopefully) break them again and again. but there comes a time when the pr chase grows difficult, except for those who entered the sport later in life and are still relatively new to it. and even those runners have to accept the fact that try as they might to keep fit and youthful, their bodies inexorably decline. it's a process that on average begins sometime in our 30s. the rate of decline gradually increases to about 0.7 percent per year (with slight variations among events and between men and women) throughout our 40s, 50s and 60s, according to the current (2010) version of the age-grading tables maintained by world masters athletics (available online through numerous age-grading calculators). the reasons for this decline are mixed and not terribly well-understood from a basic physiological level. what is known is that age lowers vo2max and decreases muscle mass. accumulated wear and tear makes you less flexible. all forms of healing take longer, including recovery from hard workouts, something you can't ignore unless you want to spiral into an endless cycle of overtraining and injury. the good news is that it could be worse. at the 2014 twin cities marathon, 59-year-old christine kennedy of los gatos, california, ran an age-defying 2:59:39, a time many runners half her age only dream of. ""humans are well-adapted to run into late middle age,"" says daniel lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at harvard university who figured prominently in the bestselling bookborn to runby christopher mcdougall. in fact, says lieberman, who has spent part of his career studying pre-industrial cultures, our ancestors appear to have evolved to continue running or hunting well into today's masters years. ""hunter/gatherers who survive childhood often live into their 70s or even 80s and remain very active,"" he says. that does not mean, however, that the biology of aging can be ignored. it's still necessary to adjust your training—and your expectations—to the realities of getting older. those adjustments differ as you progress along the masters path. it's tempting to deny that age has any effect at the lower end of this range. after all,meb keflezighi'spr win atbostoncame only weeks before his 39th birthday, and many runners continue to improve during their late 30s. but the two oldest olympic gold medalists were carlos lopes (marathon, 1984) and constantina dita (marathon, 2008), both 38 at the time of their wins. ""the magic number is 39 to 40,"" says mark cleary, coach of the so cal track club. ""i know guys who run really fast at 38, then all of a sudden say, 'now i know what you're talking about.' "" some spend their early masters career bemoaning every race as a new pw—personal worst."
"others embrace it, counting the days until their 40th birthday when they have a chance to set records in a new category. amy begley, a 2008 olympian and now head coach of the atlanta track club, says every athlete has to deal with change. ""there was a high point, and now they have to reset the goals,"" begley says. her husband, andrew, another coach with the club, faced similar issues earlier than most, when a knee injury in his 20s took him out of elite competition. ""my advice is to learn to race against yourself,"" he says. (get training plans to run strong in your 40's, 50's, and 60's.shop now) one way to measure that personal competition is by using predictor workouts, then trying to beat the prediction. andrew begley used the mile down workout, starting with 1600m, then working down: 1200-800-600-400-300-200m. ""when you add up all of the times for this workout, i could run within 20 to 30 seconds of that for a 5k race,"" he says. ""so when i got into the race, i was trying to run a little faster than predicted. if i could look myself in the mirror after my race and tell myself that i worked hard and didn't quit, it was a victory."" in terms of training, the changes at this early stage in masters running are relatively minor. realize that injuries can be more frequent and take longer to heal. ""extra recovery time needs to be built in,"" amy begley says. ""you may wind up doing more cross-training."" and women, in particular, need to be aware of the risk of declining bone mass. ""i encourage lifting exercises to keep up density in the upper body and spine,"" she says. priorities for a young masters runner while the increase in recovery time and the decline in top performances are impossible to ignore, this age can be one of the most rewarding of a runner's life. each age group represents a chance to be the young runner again, providing anticipation as the turn-year approaches and offering the thrill of setting new marks and competing for awards as you enter the new group. some people who had busy family lives when they were younger may suddenly find new time for training. consider colleen rocereto of tigard, oregon. at 49, with the last of her three sons in college (and a 40:56 10k already in her arsenal), she has started joining groups—one on the track and another for weekend runs—in preparation for seeing what she can do in the 50–54 age group. the opportunity to do such workouts with partners, rather than just running out the door, has opened a new window on her training. ""i feel like i can get faster and stronger,"" she says. another motivation is simply to beat the age-grading curve. in fact, you can easily channel the energy you once put into chasing prs into chasing age-graded prs, with similar, if not greater satisfaction as you defy the hands of time."
"but this is also the age when masters reality truly sets in. not only do you have to be exceptional to still be fighting for the type of position you might once have had among the open-class runners, but if you haven't already adjusted training to accommodate your changing body, you're in danger of spending this decade fighting off injuries. ""keep health before fitness,"" cotner says. ""if you're always having to compromise workouts by what hurts, you're not going to get very far."" part of staying healthy is maintaining muscle strength and flexibility. ""that's a real change from a number of years ago,"" says bob williams, a portland, oregon, coach. ""people are now in the gym—they're really doing it."" two muscle groups of particular importance are the calves and hip flexors. for the calves, the most common problems are inflexibility and muscle pulls. but aging calves can also lose power. to see if this applies to you, cotner suggests finding a steep hill and running up it, counting strides. he uses a hill that's about 500 meters long, with a grade of 12 to 14 percent, but there's no magic to that formula, especially in places where long, steep hills are hard to find. what matters is that the fewer strides it takes to cover the course, the more power you have in your calves—and that you repeat this test on the same hill periodically to see whether you're improving, declining or maintaining. as for hip flexors, they are the muscles that help lift your knees and swing them forward between strides—meaning that there is a strong correlation between hip flexor strength and running speed. but they can lose strength and flexibility, especially if your job entails increasing amounts of sitting as you get older. tight hip flexors can also lead to hamstring problems. that's because the hip flexors attach to the pelvis and to several vertebrae of the lower back. when they get tight, cotner says, they change the tilt of the pelvis. the result is a reduced ability to activate the glute muscles, less hip extension (the upper leg going out behind) and hamstrings that are overstretched and weak—so much so that cotner sees the combination of these problems as a common syndrome. the solution to any of these problems, of course, is strength and flexibility training. you can no longer get away with perfunctory stretches and just running. all those articles about supplemental training that you ignored in your 20s now make the difference between continuing as a successful racer and dropping out with injury or dropping off with a compromised stride. other training tips for runners in this age group are simpler. pretty much every coach, for example, recommends spending as much time as possible on soft surfaces. ""run too much pavement,"" cleary says, ""and your days are numbered."" he feels that even tempo runs should be on a track, trail or other soft surface. ""i'll do 24 laps around a sports park, on grass,"" he says."
"cleary is 56; if you insist on spending all your time pounding the pavement, he says, ""i'll be running 10 years from now when you're not."" priorities for a middle masters runner to begin, the 55-59 age group is the first to show a truly marked drop-off in the number of competitors. for example, in 2014, the 9,000-runner california international marathon saw only 397 combined male and female finishers at ages 55-59, compared to 702 in the 50-54 group and 915 in the 45-49 group. by 60-64, the number of finishers had plummeted to 189. other than praying you have good genes and doing your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle, there's not a lot you can do to keep yourself from joining the ranks of those sidelined by arthritis and other nonrunning ailments. but if you're one of those people who is never happy with your race results, this might be a good time to start acknowledging the successes you've already had, before the unpleasant time comes—however far in the future—when there are no more successes. ""i am appreciating my past times more than i did when i ran them,"" says suzanne ray, who lt age 62, set the course record for 60-plus at the california international marathon with a 3:24:01. ""the key to longevity in running is joy,"" she says. but this doesn't mean you can't still strive for improvement. running, ray says, is as much about meeting your own goals as it is about beating your rivals, which means the drive to constantly seek more from yourself is ""almost essential."" also important to realize is that the 0.7 percent annual decrease in performance translates to 3.5 percent over the course of each five-year age group. the youngsters in your age group are now 20–30 seconds per mile ahead of you, and it's easy to get frustrated. ""the last two years in the age group can be tough,"" says mark cleary, coach of the so cal track club. one way to deal with this is simply to wait it out until the next key birthday rolls around. another is to use the upcoming age group as an incentive. that's useful, williams says, because ""you need to ramp up a year or so early to really be effective. ""(get training plans to run strong in your 40's, 50's, and 60's.shop now) meanwhile, you do need to make some training changes. one is to recognize that just as masters runners don't recover as easily as open-class runners, older masters runners don't recover as quickly as younger ones. you have to become more adept at monitoring and judging your recovery, not relying on timing rules or other runners' experiences. ""the key is only to do the next workout when you're recovered,"" cotner says. ""in some cases it's only a day or two longer than in the 30s and 40s. sometimes it can be a whole week."""
"cleary adds that this is a good time to start taking extra rest days, even if that means taking two or three days off in a row if you feel a warning twinge. ""i've learned that being in the game is more important than trying to push and not being able to compete,"" he says. in his coaching, he's adopted the same attitude. ""i tell them, when in doubt, do a pool workout. that has saved more butts than i can tell you."" if the idea of backing off makes you feel lazy, tom mcglynn, founder of the online training program called runcoach, has a rule of thumb he calls 60/80. it applies to runners of all ages (mcglynn is in his early 40s) but is particularly important to older masters runners bemoaning their inability to put in the high volumes they once did. what the 60/80 rule means, mcglynn says, is that even massive cutbacks in training don't slow you down as much as you might fear. ""i can do 60 percent in terms of volume and intensity and still be 80 percent as good,"" he says. though to make this work, he says, you need to be careful not to jack up your speed work in an effort to compensate for reduced volume. ""a lot of people do 60 percent of the volume, then train so hard they have achilles tendinitis and everything else,"" he says. even if you've had a relatively smooth path through your masters career so far, this is another time when you may need to revise expectations for racing and training. priorities for a masters runner climbing the age ranks whatever evolutionary biologist lieberman says about our distant ancestors, this is an age where simply lining up for the start of a race is something most peers would never attempt. but if you're careful and dedicated, it's still possible to be good. one person who's discovered this is mike reif, coach of the genesee valley harriers, an upstate new york club that has won dozens of masters championships. ""i've been running for over 55 years and [at age 65] got motivated because of the new age group,"" he says. he lost weight and began running with the athletes he coaches. he also remembered his youth, when he was on a national championship team. ""my mindset went back to that,"" he says. ""if you can make that transition, you can get motivated at any age."" also useful is to find a club, even if many of the runners aren't your age. you can mentor some of the young ones. others are inspirational, letting you point to a young speedster and say, ""hey, he's part of my team."" reif's club competes in usa track & field meets, where masters events can have sizeable fields, even in the higher age groups. but in road races, joe kregal, a 70-year-old from portland, oregon, says he is far too often the only one in his age group."
"that, he says, makes the victory feel hollow, even though he can still run a highly respectable 22:48 5k. ""so,"" he says, ""i compete with whoever's moving. if there are 1,000 people in the race and i come in in the top 20 percent, that's my race."" from a training perspective, caution now rules. kregal is a fan of monitoring his body's twinges and reacts accordingly. and he believes in active recovery, like swimming and biking. it's also increasingly important to pay attention to strength training. the average person steadily loses muscle mass after age 30—this can represent a 30 to 40 percent decline by age 70. just because you run, don't believe you're immune to this. and whatever you do, don't listen to the naysayers. ""unless there's something anatomically wrong with you, you can get some pretty good speed going,"" kregal says. ""the problem is that society wants to close you down. don't quit when people tell you to."" priorities for a senior masters runner kregal's advice to 70-year-olds applies double to the age divisions above him. for about two decades, beginning in the late 1980s, john keston (now 90) was the dominant runner among his peers, setting age-group records in a wide range of distances. in his 70s he trained fairly traditionally, but as he approached 80, he found that rest had become so important he shifted to a three-day workout rotation, running one day (up to 16 miles), then walking 6 miles on each of the next two days. ""i also raced a lot, using the races as my speed work,"" he says. only running every third day was a radical change from his prior training formula. but, he notes, ""it worked."" it worked so well, in fact, that at 80 he set world's bests for at least three distances: the mile, the 3,000m and the half marathon. others find, though, that as the years mount, the onetime nuances of form, pacing, race strategy and training take a backseat to simply lining up for the next race start. marv metzer, an 87-year-old from mccook, nebraska, still manages a 3:26 half marathon. not fast, but it's the equivalent of a 30-year-old's 1:43. at his age, he says, training becomes more and more like work, and it's increasingly difficult to stay in shape. you also have to get used to the fact that you're slower than you'd like to be. on a recent training run, he says, he noticed his shadow and ""it looked like i was walking."" he's also had to reduce his racing (because otherwise he'd spend all of his time recovering) and cut his training drastically. ""i'm only doing about 15 miles a week,"" he says. ""a few years ago, i did 60."" but he plans to keep going, even if eventually he winds up walking. ""unless something happens,"" he says, ""i'm still going to be out there moving."" reif echoes the same sentiment. ""use it or lose it,"" he says. ""its very important to stay active and healthy."
"i am very motivated to live a healthy lifestyle for the rest of my life."" and from a much younger masters perspective, cotner notes that with each new age group, everything readjusts. ""but that's what masters running is,"" he says. ""you're reinventing yourself every season. we wipe the slate and start over."" priorities for the super-master runner (get training plans to run strong in your 40's, 50's, and 60's.shop now) everything you need to know about hip pain how to increase mileage running periodized training can help you hit your goals marathon pace charts for fine-tuning training first boston marathon? here‘s what to know foods that cut inflammation to improve performance how to estimate your lactate threshold pace how to plan your 2024 race schedule ultramarathons—you can go farther than 26.2 miles the benefits of resistance sprints new york city marathon 2023 faq why you need to slow down on your recovery runs a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"some of them stay up better than others, but all are comfortable. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? what’s better than a pair of comfortable, supportive, wicking running tights? comfortable, supportive, wickingrunning tightswith secure phone pockets built right in. at this point, almost all of myleggingshave pockets built in. i run with my phone in one of the deep side pockets, stash a few gels in waistband mesh pockets, and tuck a credit card into zipper back pockets. this eliminates the need for apack, and means i don’t have to load up my jacket pockets (which can feel bouncier than legging pockets). there are plenty of leggings with pockets, but not all of them are secure and comfortable for running. loading the waistband and side pockets without the tights sliding down requires a high, wide, secure waistband that stays in place even with bouncing and a phone in the side. that means some of my top picks have a higher percentage of elastane for better shape retention and security, which also adds nice compression for muscle support. your legging pockets should be deep and secure, and i look for a variety in addition to the phone pocket, including deep side compartments on the outside of the thighs, and ideally a zipper pocket along the back of the waistband if i want to bring cash or a card. read on for my recommendations and reviews, born out of my testing. want more? see our articles onthe best sports bras with pockets,the best hydration packs,andthe best workout leggings. material blends play a key role in performance apparel. i look for moisture-wicking synthetics (usually polyester or nylon), which pull sweat away from my skin and aid in breathability. for warm-weather runs, mesh paneling or body-mapped perforations can be nice, and i prioritize four-way stretch to maximize range of motion as well as shape retention. most tights have a percentage of elastane or spandex (10-35 percent) to provide durability, stretch, and light compression. like i mentioned above, if you want to load the pockets, consider a higher percentage of elastane that will help prevent the tights from stretching and sagging. the best running tights have a snug, supportive fit that enhances comfort (and performance) by reducing friction and providing light-to-moderate compression. a good fit should feel secure but not restrictive, allowing for full range of motion without bunching or pinching. i like a high, wide waistband to help keep the tights in place without rolling or sliding, and i always aim to try on the leggings to ensure they conform well to my body. if you’re planning to load up the pockets, look for a drawcord in the waistband to help minimize sliding. most name-brand running tights are fairly pricey, so you want them to last. all of the tights i recommend here are made with high-quality nylon or polyester, along with that 10-35 percent elastane (spandex) for added stretch and strength."
"i look for tights with reinforced seams and tightly woven, abrasion-resistant fabrics, especially if i plan to take them out on the trail where they could get scuffed on plants and rocks. and the moisture-wicking properties aren’t just for comfort—they help maintain the fabric integrity by reducing wear from sweat. we focused on leggings with phone pockets here. but within that category, i recommend looking for pocket features that fit your specific needs, like zippered options if you often run with credit cards or your car key, or a small key clasp for security. all of the pockets on these tights are oriented for easy access, as well as tight and secure for keeping your items close to your body without bouncing out. drawcords can help leggings stay up over your hips even with items in the pockets, and reflective detailing can keep you safe on pre-dawn or after-dark runs. except for my budget pickbaleafs, all tights on this list are around $100, which is a lot of money for running apparel. that said, these should last multiple seasons, even with heavy use. you’re paying for high-quality, technical materials like moisture-wicking fabrics, compression technology, and durability that make them a worthwhile investment for avid runners—or people who would rather wear athletic clothes at all times. cheaper options can work, just make sure they’re highly rated by real people. and be aware the cheap options might not last as long or provide the same amount of performance and durability. if you’re really cringing at the prices, i recommend looking for last season’s colors or models. these are often almost identical to in-line models, albeit in different colors or with minor design tweaks, and can often be had for a good discount as the seasons change. for this story, i tested many leggings with phone pockets, which is all i wear anyway. i wore them during road runs, gym workouts, trail runs, and longer run-hikes in the mountains around my town in southwest montana. i made sure the phone pockets a) were secure, b) had accessible placement (so i could switch the song when something depressing came on), and c) didn’t feel like they interfered with the running tights themselves. importantly, i also gauged these picks against my standard leggings, which means their high waistbands didn’t slide down, light compression provided fit and structure, and wicking materials kept sweat and odor at bay. the best leggings with the most secure, convenient phone pockets made this list. my phone addiction and inability to run without music finally came in handy. i’ve long been a fan of janji’s shorts and tights, so i was excited to try these trail tights after several years wearing the brand’s groundwork tights. like its other compression-style pants, these have a moderate squeeze thanks to the higher percentage of elastane (32 percent) than similar models. this makes for a somewhat stiffer pair of leggings, but they’re also more abrasion-resistant, and i’ve noticed no pilling whatsoever."
"those oldergroundwork tightsalso stood out to me for their pockets, and the trail tights use the same material, but with more robust features. these have the same deep side pockets as the groundwork, plus mesh pockets along the waistband and a back pocket where you can stash gels, bars, or use it as a “pass-through” for lightweight layers. i typically don’t do this—if i’m planning to shed layers i usually have arunning pack, and i don’t want mywind jacketflapping around my legs—but i’ve seen plenty of ultrarunners use this feature and it doesn’t seem to bother them. the pockets on these tights are incredibly secure. each side pocket down the outside of the legs is more than 6 inches deep with a taper at the bottom that makes wedging a phone feel less risky. i’ve run in these tights with my phone, a headphone case, two bars, and twogelsand not had anything wiggle out of place. the higher level of compression also helps them stay put with more items in the pockets. the high and wide waistband is a non-negotiable as well, though the somewhat stiffer material here means i often have to pull the drawcord pretty tight to get the waistband to fully secure. the pockets are easy to reach into while running, though i’ve had some trouble getting under the mesh on the back waistband. janji is a dedicated running company, so these tights are also odor-resistant and dry quickly if you sweat through the material. i wore my groundwork tights (same material, remember?) every day on a 230-mile backpacking trip and was comfortable the whole time. overall, these hit top marks as versatile, convenient, abrasion-resistant tights with five generous and secure pockets. if the janji tights are a little stiffer than others, these affordable baleaf leggings are the opposite. when i first received these they looked so tiny i thought they were made for a doll. but the stretch is incredible, and they fit perfectly without feeling saggy or stretched out. these are a much simpler pair than the more expensive name brands, with welded, flat seams and flat-lock pockets without extra stitching but no cuff reinforcement. this helps keep the cost low without losing functionality, and i love how streamlined they look. our main goal here is to find the most convenient, secure phone pockets in leggings, and with extended side pockets, these fit the bill. i wear them running and working out, but they are also so understated that i feel fine wearing them around town without looking like i just came from the gym. i tuck my phone and cards into the deep side pockets and haven’t ever worried about losing them. the phone pockets have a minimal silicon band at the top that can prevent a phone from sliding out, but the leggings are so form-fitting and the pockets so deep that i’ve never been concerned. the side pockets are a similar depth as the janji pockets, and my phone can sit all the way inside without poking out."
"as far as wicking goes, these are not going to be at the same level of material as the $100 options from name brands, but i’ve barely noticed a difference in odor-resistance and moisture-management. granted, it’s usually colder when i’m wearing tights, but even on high-output workouts, these pull sweat from my body and dry quickly afterwards. the waistband actually stays in place better than other leggings i’ve tested, but it can roll (without sliding down, somehow) depending on how long you’re moving for. overall these are my recommendation for affordable, brand-name-adjacent leggings that hold a phone securely, stay in place while running and working out, and are comfortable for all-day wear. oiselle makes one of my favoritepocket bras, so it wasn’t much of a surprise that they nailed these leggings as well, with a whopping seven pockets that all securely hold small items and are easy to access on the go. the pocket jogger has a much lighter feel than most other pocket-packed running tights, with a brushed material and less elastane (just 10 percent) than others on this list. this makes them comfortable for all-day wear, but they do stay in place well thanks to the generously high-waisted cut, internal drawstring, and reinforced stitching. part of what helps these stay so secure and form-fitting (despite the lower elastane) is that oiselle gear is made entirely for women, designed by women. while i appreciate women’s apparel from other brands, i’ve found that women-specific companies often have better tailoring and fit for the female body, which allows more versatility in materials and features. so if another brand relies on heavier material to keep the pants up, a brand like oiselle has such a female-specific design that the tights will stay in place when another pair might fall down. the pockets are ample, to say the least. two wide side pockets run down the side of the legs, perfect for dropping a phone into. they also have similar mesh pockets along the waistband as the janji trail tights, with elasticized top bands that snap into place. i put a few energy gels in here, and i’ve also stashed a small headphone case without having it bounce out. the zippered back pocket is wider than others i’ve tested—where i’d normally be fighting to wedge a phone or flat-fold wallet in, the low-profile zipper is nearly 6 inches long and easy to tuck small items into the waistband. the waistband itself has a good amount of reinforcement but manages to avoid pinch points or rolling despite the extra material. in addition to the3⁄4-length here (23-inch inseam), these tights come in afull-length(27-inch inseam) version. i’ve also worn the brand’spocket jogger shorts,which have a wide zippered back pocket, two mesh waistband pockets, and two side pockets. hands down, these are the softest, most comfortable leggings i have ever worn."
"built lighter and with less compression than the running-specific tights on this list, free fly’s leggings feel like nothing on your skin, with a brushed matte finish that has none of the slipperiness of more athletic leggings but retains the high-rise fit and flattering cut. these have a surprising amount of elastane (20 percent) for how light they feel, which helps retain shape and structure. but the soft-knit design keeps them light. these are quite breathable as well, though i’d steer clear of wearing them on trails or where they might get abraded. they can snag and catch more easily than the tougher, tighter weaves of more rugged tights, and i’ve noticed pilling between the legs from friction while walking. i had a pair of these right when they debuted, and i was thrilled to see the pocket-tights update this season. this version comes with three pockets—two drop-ins on the sides with tapered bases that help keep my phone secure, plus a small drop-in pocket on the waistband. this waistband pocket isn’t as secure as the ones on other pocket tights, so i keep a gel or lip balm in here but would probably avoid stashing cash or a key. since these tights are lighter with a less compressive fit than others here, i’ve found them to be best for casual, comfortable wear, and less ideal for running—carrying a phone in the pocket can cause them to slide down, though the double-layer waistband prevents this while walking. these are also my top pick for travel, as they pack down to almost nothing, are incredibly comfortable for long flights, plus convenient when i don’t want to carry a purse or bag. one of the newer offerings from brooks, the spark tight borrows a similar 10-inch rise and reinforced waistband as the brand’s popularmethod tights, albeit with an updated material blend that enhances the breathable properties and wicking capabilities of high-output apparel. the spark uses brooks’s new “go2 secure” material, which has almost an interlocking weave that feels incredibly form-fitting and moves with me, allowing for a full range of motion and a variety of activities. the pockets on these tights are built right into the legs instead of separate mesh, with just two stitched seams along the side and a generous drop-in top. these also have the tapered bottom for extra security, allowing me to throw small items in without having them wiggle up on bouncy runs. the third pocket is a small waistband drop-in pocket. it’s larger than the drop-in waistband pocket on the free fly tights, and i can actually fit my iphone in there, though i feel more comfortable with the phone in the leg drop-in pockets. the pocket placement on the legs is similar to the other pairs i’ve listed, directly on the outside of both thighs and easy to reach in and grab my phone or stash items while running. these don’t stay up quite as well as the oiselle tights, and i find myself hiking them up every so often during runs."
"that said, i haven’t noticed a difference with a phone in the pocket (compared to not) affecting how much the tights slide down. while all tights on this list are breathable, i’ve found the spark tight to feel the smoothest and driest next-to-skin, which is somewhat surprising considering they have over 20 percent elastane. this is partially due to the almost plush-feeling weave structure, which allows tiny gaps of air between the fibers to help move moisture away from the body. maggie slepian is a full-time freelance writer in the outdoor industry and has tested gear professionally for almost ten years—she is an avid backpacker, trail runner, bikepacker, and horseback rider and has thru-hiked thousands of miles on the appalachian, colorado, and ouachita trails, along with backcountry travel on terrain including coastal trails, the desert, and high alpine peaks. maggie has written for new york magazine, huffington post, rei, and outside. she is a columnist with backpacker magazine and is the co-founder of backpackingroutes.com. contact her at maggieslepian.com. why you should race in the diadora gara carbon october prime day massage gun deals 2024 the best prime day running headphone deals 2024 october prime day running gear sales prime day treadmill deals october 2024 october prime day 2024: best walking shoe deals find a smooth ride in the adidas ultraboost 5x mount to coast: ultra shoes for road warriors the 14 best sports bras for runners a new balance shoe for the marathon track star the 6 best treadmill shoes for indoor running the 5 best hiking shoes for 2024 a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

""i think i’m a national caliber runner. i can 'fill the field,' i guess,"" avila, 29, told us from his home as his cat, simba, looked on, half awake. ""now we want to be on the start line to win.""

(ed. note: this conversation has been edited for length and clarity) i wake up at 7:30 or 8, depending when we’re meeting. it fluctuates because of traffic. i make my aeropress coffee and have my breakfast. yogurt, cocoa powder, cocoa nibs, and chia seeds that i put in the fridge overnight. in the morning i throw in some frozen fruit, peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon powder. if i’m really hungry i’ll also make some toast and marmalade just because i’m a sucker for toast and marmalade. right after that i have my coffee, take some vitamins, maybe some supplements. on a workout day, just a protein shake. sometimes i take my roommate's dog out and hang with him. sometimes i hang with the cat. usually i have my headphones on, listening to a podcast or reading a book. that's kinda my thing, like, don't talk to me. i grab a water bottle, pack my backpack, head out. i live the farthest away so i’m the one who has to leave an hour-plus before. i'm constantly checking traffic, updating, seeing where i'm at. on workout days i drink my pre-workout drink on the drive. i try get to practice on time. we chit-chat a bit about news, politics, a lot of banter. it’s like a family, it makes it fun. makes it a lot less like work than it has to be. then we do our run. monday and thursday is an easy run then drills and hill sprints or dynamic stability work. wednesday is our mid-week long run; 10 or 12 miles in the morning and call it a day. tuesday and friday are big days—a long track session or tempo then regroup at kinetic performance gym to lift for an hour or two. saturday is easy. sunday is long; 14 to 18 miles, depending where we are in training."
"terrence is really good about approaching it from a scientific standpoint but some days you’re just mentally drained. that’s where the team comes into effect. my training partners, these olympians and amazing athletes, have days when they don’t have anything. it's nice in a way to see that they’re human. all these commercials are like, ""push through the pain! no off days!"" we have a different mindset, a holistic approach. we value recovery. if you’re tired, there’s a reason. if you don’t have it today, go home. i take care of errands, you know, life stuff, and commute home. costco is down the street and they have really good acai bowls for like five bucks. if i'm really hungry i'll grab an acai bowl and a slice of pizza. i do that pretty regularly actually. otherwise i make lunch right when i get home. eggs and tuna, just a bunch of protein, and spinach. put the tuna in a skillet, crack the eggs over it, stir it up in the pan, put some cholula or sriracha on there—dude, amazing. i mean, i think it’s awesome. my parents live down the road, my dad’s retired and doesn’t have much going on so i sometimes go over and do work and hang out with him. he's funny. he gets excited about little things and that makes me happy. that brings balance to my day. on big session days, we finish around 2:30. i'll grab a chicken wrap or shawarma from the smoothie joint by the gym. there’s also a taco shop with amazing california burritos. at that point i’m just looking for calories. i get home, shower, nap. i'm exhausted at that point. four miles, maybe five. i double almost every day. my friends i grew up with, they have day jobs and they still kind of run so we’ll go jog. last year once a week i ran with the local high school kids, which was a lot of fun. their energy’s contagious. there’s a junior college in the area too so sometimes i run with them. or i run from my house. the chula vista olympic training center trail is right outside my door. i’m definitely spoiled. i also have a guest room that's a revolving door of other athletes and teammates so that makes it easy to just step out the door and go. i go to trader joe’s or sprouts and pick up salmon or whatever i’m cooking that night. there are some breweries along the trail too so sometimes i run and then my brother, who also lives down the road, and i will go grab a beer. or i'll get flame broiler—it’s the healthiest to-go down the road. there’s a really good thai place that makes amazing curry, so i go there like once a week. sometimes there’s trivia night with my teammates so i go into town. most nights i fire up the oven, chop up some sweet potatoes and broccoli. pretty standard, boring. i have my routine down."

"we asked seasoned trail runners which apps they turn to when they want to clock miles through the woods. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? one of the best things about running is that you don’t really need many tools or gadgets to get out there and do it.trail running, in particular, often comes with the beauty of disconnecting from the world and enjoying nature’s views around you. so it might seem a little ironic that smart phone apps are often key tools for planning and executing an epic trail run. but they certainly come in handy when it’s time tomap out your route. apps meant for planning outhikingtreks andmountain biking adventurescan help you find the best trails to find your stride. and they’ll tell you everything from elevation gain to current trail conditions. some even let you download maps to use for navigation offline when you’re in a cell service dead zone. to help you figure out the best apps to download for trail running, we asked seasoned trail runners to tell us what they use to plan their trips. here, the top five picks. alltrailsseems to be the most popular pick among trail runners for a few reasons. “this app satisfies my basic planning needs for ashort runor day-long adventure,” says olympian and hoka-sponsored ultra-marathon runnermagda boulet. this is especially important forzach miller, ultrarunner for the north face, who lives and trains out of his bus. “i move around a lot and am often in areas that i am not very familiar with,” he says. “it’s funny how you can be in the middle of a trail running paradise but feel like you don’t know where/how to access all that is there. the alltrails app is really helpful for seeing what is around.” one of the most useful features of the app is the difficulty ratings for each trail—but you have to keep in mind that those rating may not be totally accurate for you. “they’re often put in by locals who are used to the trails,” saysmirna valerio, an ultrarunner sponsored by merrell and author ofa beautiful work in progress. “‘moderate for a local can be extremely difficult for someone who hasn't trail run there before. so it’s helpful—but take it with a grain of salt,” she says. other stand-out features of alltrails include: price:basic membership: free; pro membership: $30/yearavailable on:ios and android primarily meant for finding mountain bike trails,mtb projectcan be helpful when you’re trail running in a place that primarily has mixed-use trails, valerio says. “sometimes it has trails on it that alltrails doesn’t,” she says. it doesn’t always load properly, she notes, so make sure you have your trail picked out and map downloaded before you get into poor-cell-service territory. stand-out features include: price:freeavailable on:ios and android theonx huntis the app valerio turns to when there’s a lot of unmarked trails in the area. it shows an extensive trail network, and makes it clear who owns the land—whether it’s federal, state, or private."
"“you don't want to be trespassing on someone’s property when it’s an unmarked trail,” valerio says. since the app shows you who owns the property, you could potentially contact them and ask if you could use their trails. join runner's world+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners stand-out features include: price:premium (includes 1 state): $30/year; elite (all 50 states): $100/yearavailable on:ios and android “thegaia gpsapp offers a wonderful feature of downloading maps, makes it easy to record data, and share trips with family and friends,” boulet says. “it is my safety partner that helps me navigate the backcountry.” she describes gaia as her go-to app when she feels more adventurous and needs help navigating the less traveled backcountry trails over multiple days. craig randall, a trail runner who works with thefastest known time(fkt), says that runners in the fkt community rely on this app big time for both planning andtrackingpurposes. stand-out features include: price:basic membership: free; premium membership: $40/yearavailable on:ios and android randall says thatcaltopois another app that the ftk community uses often. he describes the mapping information as “incredibly comprehensive.” “caltopo is incredibly sophisticated and can show slope angle shading, current snow pack, a water gauge to show where you can fill up and filter water, and wildfire activity,” randall says. manypeople chasing fastest known timesdon't follow traditional trails and paths, randall adds, and caltopo is an invaluable tool for planning routes and gathering important data (namely, those snow pack and wildfire forecasting stats) to traverse safely. stand-out features include: price:basic mapping features: free; mobile: $21/year; pro: $50/year; andother paid optionsavailable on:ios and android fuel with what you want to eat a guide to trail running for beginners trail running tips for beginners and experts how to make running with a water bottle easier save on frontline plus products at amazon now how to run with poles how a champion preps for a day of trail running how to plan a hut-to-hut running adventure the 30 best gifts for hikers in 2022 winter trail running safety tips 10 best hiking pants for comfort on every trail how your body handles trail versus road running a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"our favorite recent design trend? lamps that work with both rechargeable and aaa batteries. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? whether you’re a predawn runner or are missing out on daylight duringpost-work sessions, running outside can be a logistical challenge. but when equipped with a quality headlamp (andreflective apparel, of course), logging miles in the dark can be a blast. see quick info below on some of the bestlightsfrom our testing, then scroll deeper for longer reviews of these and other top-performing models, plus buying advice. running on an open road under a full moon is a completely different experience than running singletrack trails beneath heavy tree cover—and both require different lighting. in general, look for a headlamp that’s capable of cranking out at least 200 lumens on its high setting. lumens is a measure of the light’s intensity—brightness. lamps with higher lumens—300 and up—are better for trails and starless nights. if you want a single light that is capable of multiple situations, look for one with more than just low, medium, and high settings. some lamps can automatically adapt to the ambient light around you—handy if, say, you peek at your watch and don’t want to be blinded by the reflection (the light dims a bit). others allow you more manual adjustability. longer battery life typically comes at a cost: weight. naturally, batteries with more capacity have to be larger. for some activities, that’s no problem, but for running, extra weight and bulk can lead to annoying bounce. some models cram the batteries into the lamp on your forehead, while others with exceptionally long burn times will separate the two components and place the power pack on the strap at the back of your head. if you want a budget light for laps around your neighborhood, the former will suffice. but if you’re gearing up for an ultramarathon that will have you up all night, go for the bigger battery. who among us doesn’t have a drawer full of various usb charging cables? well, there’s a good chance your next headlamp will come with one as well. but the downside to rechargeables is that you could find the battery dead as you’re headed out the door, when you don’t have an hour or two to spare waiting for it to power up. if that sounds like you, opt for a light that runs off aa or aaa batteries, and stock up. some headlamps (see thesilva trail runner free handblack diamond sprinter 500below) work with either aaa batteries or a rechargeable battery pack if you want that kind of versatility. you’ll save money by getting a light with a single lamp that puts out a consistent beam. but more advanced options include both a spotlight and a flood, allowing you to use each separately or combine the two for maximum brightness. you’ll find the spotlight is great for casting the light farther down the road or brightly illuminating the trail directly in front of you."
"a floodlight, on the other hand, diffuses the beam, spraying light to the sides as well to help with peripheral vision. our team of editors and writers has tested and evaluated every headlamp on this list (and more). we research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and designers, and rely on our own experience on roads and trails long after the sun has set or before it comes up. runner-in-chief jeff dengate tests and evaluates headlamps in our darkened running shoe storage room. to gauge light intensity, we used a handheld luxmeter placed on the ground approximately two strides away. we tested the headlamps every 15 minutes to determine how long they shined at their maximum brightness. some lamps dim by as much as two-thirds in the first five minutes. others maintain full intensity until their batteries die. in addition to evaluating these headlamps for their adjustability and beam types, we test the lights’ brightness over time to determine how long each shines at full power. for theblack diamond sprint 225andsprinter 500,energizer vision ultra hd,silva trail runner free h, andpetzl actik core, we did this by turning each lamp on at its maximum setting and pointing it at a digital luxmeter on the ground roughly two strides away—about as far as you’d look ahead on technical trails. we measured the intensity at 15-minute intervals to see how quickly the light faded. most models gradually dimmed over time, though a few fell off quickly—black diamond and biolite say it’s an industry standard to drop intensity as your eyes adjust to the darkness so they can extend run time. for such lamps, the max lumens and battery life are a bit misleading, since you’ll never be able to keep the lamp at 100 percent for more than a few minutes. for this most recent update, we evaluated the current lineup of headlamps and made sure all were up to date and still available. we tested during extended night hiking and running (both pre-dawn and after sunset), taking into consideration the same criteria as we did in previous rounds, including light intensity over time (though we didn’t use the digital luxmeter this go), battery life on all settings, adjustability, recharging time if applicable, and beam strength. and we put an emphasis on comfort and stability during running and other high-impact activities. if the headlamp is headache-inducing or doesn’t stay put while running, it’s hard to recommend. out of that crop, thebiolite headlamp 325,nitecore nu25, andblack diamond distance 1500earned their way into our rankings. we love this sleek, compact headlamp for running because of its performance and features, combined with its comfortable fit. the slim headband doesn’t look all that sturdy but does a great job of keeping the small light from bouncing, and the easy adjustability makes it dead simple to change brightness. instead of clicking a small button to dim or brighten the lamp, simply swipe up or down past sensors on the side of the housing to change intensity—it even works with gloves and sweaty hands."
"a note about the “2 hours on high” battery claim: my testing found the sprint 225 dims considerably during the first 5 minutes on high power—a far faster drop-off than most lamps on this page—and then settles into a medium intensity that black diamond says is intended as a “power-saving feature.” i found that medium intensity is plenty bright for both trail and road running, and it remained steady for the next 3 hours. but just know you won’t get a full 225 lumens for more than a few minutes at a time.—jeff dengate a surprisingly versatile headlamp at a dirt cheap price, energizer’s vision ultra hd shocked me with how much light it puts out—a claimed 400 lumens. the spotlight was bright enough to illuminate the road a good distance in front of me, and switching it to flood mode cast a wide spread closer to my feet when i wanted to see where i was actually stepping. plus, it has both red and green night vision leds. i’ve been using the red to read in bed at night, to be honest. of course, a budget lamp sometimes has trade-offs. the charging cable for our sample had been crimped in the packaging or damaged before being sealed up, because the insulation around the wires was damaged. we were able to repair it ourselves rather quickly, and we haven’t had any issues since. still, we’ll be keeping an eye on the continued durability of both headlamp and charging cord.—jd the sprinter 500 is reminiscent of the icon that we’ve recommended before and loved, but in a more runner-friendly package. it, too, uses the rear-mounted battery pack and over-the-head stabilizing strap, but the battery pack and lamp unit both are smaller and lighter so they won’t wiggle a bit when you’re bounding down a dark road. like the earlier 275 model, the new sprinter 500 still operates with a rechargeable battery pack or three aaa batteries. the major difference is—you guessed it—an additional 225 lumens. and, while its runtime isn’t all that impressive on a spec sheet, we’ve found you can dial back the intensity to get through any overnight ultra outing. if you need the high-beam and drain it, swapping to disposable batteries is quick and easy. a favorite feature of ours is the lamp’s memory feature, so the beam is the same brightness every time you turn it on. “i love the sprinter 500 because it’s super lightweight, bright, small, and has versatile power options,” saidpat heine,runner’s world’s video producer and resident ultrarunner. “it spans the gap between budget options and the ‘bright-as-a-truck’s-headlights’ lamps. i use it for the majority of my night running.”—jd following up on silva’s tank-like ultrarunning headlamp, thetrail speed 5xt, this lighter, slimmer model works on short trail and road runs. the battery pack is a slim hybrid unit mounted on the back of the headband and, rather than routing coiled cables through clips, the power passes through the headband itself. it’s a neat feature that makes the lamp even more comfortable in use."
"but, if you need to stash the battery pack inside a jacket for especially cold outings, a longer cloth-wrapped cable is included. the lamp offers only three brightness settings, and you can’t select different lights (beam/flood). but it has a combination that works well at running speeds—a floodlight hits the ground nearest you while a sharper beam is cast farther ahead. in our tests, it held its max brightness consistently for the first 2 hours, but fell off a cliff by the end of the third hour; its light was so dim you wouldn’t be able to find your way out of the woods on a moonless night. another really cool feature is the ability to toggle a rear red light for road running. inside the battery case, a switch can be set to off, on, or blink. the “h” in the name stands for “hybrid” battery. aversion that runs on only three aaa batteriescosts a bit less, or you can getone with a larger battery packfor $140.—jd like others here, this headlamp is versatile in that it can run off either three aaa batteries or a rechargeable “core” battery pack that comes with the lamp—and you don’t need any special converters. but best of all: the micro usb charging port is built into the battery pack. in a pinch, you can leave it plugged in at home while you use the headlamp with aaa batteries. in use, it has three modes, with a floodlight and spot beam, plus a red lamp that lets you see in the dark without blinding yourself or your running partners. plus, the band has 360-degree reflective accents and a whistle built into one of the adjustment buckles.—jd the 325 is one of the newer offerings from biolite, replacing the 330 from a few seasons ago. aside from faster charging and a longer battery life, the main upgrade i appreciate from this new model is the lack of extra battery pack on the back. i thought this might impact battery life, but the 325 actually lasted almost 40 minutes longer on high than the 330. that said, i didn’t find biolite’s claim for 3 hours of high-powered output to be accurate, and even with a fresh charge, the 325 only lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes on high. where it stands out is the integrated light casing. instead of a more bulky light-and-control housing, this lays almost flat against the headband strap and barely protrudes at all. this both reduced bounce (which keeps the headlamp in place better) and eliminated potential pressure points.—maggie slepian this is one of our top picks for extended trips or overnight runs thanks to its winning combination of lumens, weight, and impressive battery life. despite the decidedly more industrial look than the sleek big-box outdoor brands, this little powerhouse packs a punch in every category. for less than 2 ounces, it has multiple brightness modes, a strobe mode, and a red-light mode for walking around aid stations without making everyone else mad."
"in my experience, 360 lumens is more than enough for running at night. and the nu25 charges in less than 90 minutes from low battery to full. nitecore says it lasts 160 hours on low (i haven’t tested this), but the brand also says that “low” is 1 lumen, which realistically none of us are really using unless we’re in dire straits. that said, you’ll get usable light (from 40 to 190 lumens) for 5 to 8 hours, which is impressive for such a small package. the red light is bright, and i was able to run and hike with the high output red light for several hours, which also eases eye strain and makes you less of a pain around other people.—ms for ultrarunners (or anyone tackling an extended run in the dark over technical terrain), the black diamond distance 1500 is a bright, powerful headlamp with a magnetic battery pack that makes swapping batteries easy and reduces the stress of running out of power. i used this primarily on its 300-lumen setting, which can last up to 8 hours (i maxed out at 6 hours before finishing the trail section), and a simple tap on the side brings this to its full 1,500-lumen power for 10 seconds of “boost,” which helps you clarify any weird trail obstacles or animal eyes in the dark. it’s very reasonable to expect this to be serviceable for an entire overnight during an ultra, as long as you bring a spare battery pack to change out, which takes 30 seconds. the over-the-head strap system keeps this somewhat heavier model in place better than other 1,500-lumen options. and while it does bounce more than an ultralight model, it did stay in place well during my testing.—ms jeff is runner-in-chief forrunner's world, guiding the brand's shoes and gear coverage. a true shoe dog, he's spent more than a decade testing and reviewing shoes. in 2017, he ran in 285 different pairs of shoes, including a streak of 257 days wearing a different model. maggie slepian is a full-time freelance writer in the outdoor industry and has tested gear professionally for almost ten years—she is an avid backpacker, trail runner, bikepacker, and horseback rider and has thru-hiked thousands of miles on the appalachian, colorado, and ouachita trails, along with backcountry travel on terrain including coastal trails, the desert, and high alpine peaks. maggie has written for new york magazine, huffington post, rei, and outside. she is a columnist with backpacker magazine and is the co-founder of backpackingroutes.com. contact her at maggieslepian.com."

"use these tips when you want to clock miles on snowy wooded paths. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? whether you’rerunningon snow-packed dirt roads, fluffy singletrack through wilderness, urban park trails, or groomed routes for snowmobilers ornordic skiers, winter trail runs offer a refreshing joy and challenge. “trail runningin winter can be a different, exhilarating experience—and fun. a lot of times that can mean running at night and dealing with the conditions is part of the game no matter what the temperature is. if you know how to prepare and feel safe, you don’t have to feel limited bywinter weather,” says amie dworecki, head coach and ceo of running with life. join runner's world+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners kari gibbons, a two-time finisher and the 2021 women’s foot champion of the 350-mileiditarod trail invitational, agrees and adds, “i’ve always loved that feeling of being warm outside on arun when it’s cold. themental sideis the hardest part. but working through winter trailrun challengescan make you stronger in yoursummer runs.” here, tips on how to safely plan a winter trail run according to experienced winter athletes, coaches, and race directors. plus, a few trails across the u.s. worth checking out. snowy landscapes are serene but can be disorienting, especially if you’re not well-versed with the surrounding landmarks. “get really familiar with a shorter trail before you branch out on longer trails. everything is white and looks different in winter,” says dworecki, who is also an rrca-certified run coach, based in indiana. in addition to navigation, yourbody also needs to adjust to the new terrain. “winter trail running surfaces can be more strenuous, because you’re using morecore stabilizationand balance,” says dworecki. she recommends cutting your distance in half at first to see how your body responds. you don’t want to be sidelined due tofatigueor move super slow in cold weather—which can leadhypothermiaor frostbite—if you try to tackle mileage that ends up being too rigorous. forwinter runs, gibbons has a one-hour rule. “if the run is longer than one hour, you don’t want to soak your layers in sweat. if you’re wet, you’ll be in trouble,” says gibbons. too few or too manylayersand over-sweating can lead to hypothermia, adds arctic ultrarunner martin like, the creator and race director of the6633 arctic ultrain the canadian yukon territory. the key: micro-adjustments to yourlayeringsystem. “heat regulation and venting will allow you torun longerand be safer, because you’re not drenched. all my layers on top have zippers and hoods. if i’mtrail runningand see a hill, i unzip a couple of layers or take my hat off (i wear two light hats instead of one thick one). at the top of hill, it’s blustery, and i zip back up,” says gibbons. like agrees, “you don’t want to think, ‘i’m getting warm and i’ll just get to top of hill.’ then you’ve done too much sweating, and it’s too late. deal with the heat management scenario there and then."
"don’t put it off.” against the skin, wear a thin sweat-wicking, quick-drying base layer, says like, such as thetracksmith brighton base layer. like does not recommend wearing a waterproof jacket as an outerlayer, “because they do not rid moisture quick enough.” instead, look for an active insulation outerlayer that helps to regulate body temperature while dumping body heat, like thedaehlie jacket winter run 2.0or thearc’teryx atom lt hoody. dworecki adds that you should wearglovesor mittens, ahat, and bring a waterproof or warm outerlayer in apack, just in case you need to stop. “if you’re lost or standing around navigating, you don’t want to get cold,” she says. also, exposed skin—such as on your fingers, ears, or nose—can lead to frostbite, so make sure you have everything covered if thetemperatures are freezingand consider windchill, too. “frostbite can sneak up and is a risk if you need to stop on the trail. if your exposed skin starts to turn red or white or is turning numb, be aware of that sign,” says dworecki. “if your running partner’s speech is slurred or they’re shivering uncontrollably, get out the foil blanket, use your cell phone, and get inside as soon as possible,” she adds. if the conditions are icy,run slowerthan usual, and considertraction devices. “you can wear crampons or microspikes, which are like tire chains for your feet. they make workouts better, because you have grip and aren’t sliding around. you don’t want to fall or twist your ankle,” says dworecki. (ice can existunderthe snow, too.) to verify the fit, pull on yourtraction devicesfor a short run near your house before heading to a route further away or one that’s remote. also, be sure to wear the correcttrail running shoefor the area’s winter conditions—be it mud, ice, or snow—so the grip is adequate, adds dworecki. beware: “the same roots and rocks that exist in the summer exist in the winter under the smooth snow. though it can be strenuous, be sure to pick up your feet as you run,” says dworecki. if the trail is ungroomed and has fresh, deep snow, gibbons packs running poles anddion lightweight race snowshoes. from antarctica to new mexico’s 43-mile mt taylor winter quadrathlon, dworecki has raced in extreme conditions including ice-coated terrain and -25 degrees fahrenheit temperatures, so she knows what it’s like totrail runin remote wilderness areas with tricky conditions. she says to consider picking up a compactrun-specific first aid kit, then add supplies based on the terrain and winter conditions in which you’ll be clocking miles. “put in anemergency blanketto keep yourself warm if anything happens. if you’re in an area that deals with wildlife, carry bear spray or pepper spray. add a lighter or waterproof matches too,” she recommends. gibbons, who lives in minneapolis, brings a lightweight 3.5-ouncesol emergency bivvyas an emergency sleeping bag. like carries a thermal blanket on winter mountain runs near his home in wales, united kingdom. follow their lead by bringing a warm layer, just in case you need it."
"winter days are shorter, so bring a smallheadlamp(double-check the batteries or rechargeable battery are fullbeforehand). pack an emergency whistle or alarm, such as thenathan saferun ripcord siren personal alarm, that can alert others nearby—especially over blustery gusts—or scare off wildlife. “check the weather the day before and the day of your run. mountainweather in the wintercan change quickly to white out conditions,” says dworecki. if you’ll be surrounded bysteep terrain—such as below a slope that is 30 degrees or greater—read and understand the avalanche conditions with the local or regional forecasting center. “if there’s avalanche danger, you may want to carry a transceiver—that’s a whole other level of precautions in those types of conditions,” says dworecki. if you plan to trail run or pull onrunning snowshoes, such as thenorthern lites race wave, which are narrower and shorter than regular snowshoes for enhanced mobility in snow, in avalanche terrain, take a certified avalanche education class such asaiare 1. the american institute for avalanche research and education offers this beginner-level course for winter recreationists. “know where you are, your abilities, respect the weather massively, and act accordingly,” says like. in case of an emergency, “carry your cell phone close to the body, so the battery doesn’t get zapped by thecold temperatures,” says dworecki. in locations without cell service, pack a satellite communication device to reach out for help or emergency responders if needed, adds like. for remote winter runs and “especially if you go into the mountains, learn how to navigate using a compass, awatch with gps, or a gps device, so that you can backtrack if you need to,” says dworecki. “it’s good to take a map,” adds like. gibbons uses her watch to track breadcrumbs. “if i get lost, i can get back to where i was. once, a friend and i went off trail to explore and couldn’t find the trail again. i looked at mywatchand we walked 40 feet to the left,” she says. even if the ground is snowy, variables such as wind, fresh snowfall, or other footprints can cover your tracks orvisibilitycould be poor. so, you want to be extra careful and bring backup to help you navigate. “if it’s -14 degrees fahrenheit, i’m warm but i’mbreathing in cold airthat hits my precious sweet lungs. you have to put something over your lungs, which i learned after walking away from winter races with lingering bronchitis symptoms,” says gibbons. cold, dry air inhaled onlong-distance runscan aggravate the airways and potentially triggerexercise-induced bronchoconstrictionwith respiratory symptoms such ascoughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and decreased endurance, according to theamerican college of allergy, asthma, and immunology. if the combination of cold temperatures, humidity, and windchill make a deep breath feel piercing or difficult, gibbons wears acoldavengermask, which creates a micro-climate in front of the nose and mouth where exhalations humidify. if the conditions are cold but not freezing, like if it’s 30 degrees fahrenheit out, she’ll wear a buff over her nose and mouth."
"ultimately, gibbons suggests listening to your body and respecting how your lungs react to cold temperatures, because every person’s health, health history,workout goals, and surrounding environment is different. generally, if the temperatures are near or below freezing (32 degrees fahrenheit) runners can consider covering your mouth and nose with aneck gaiter. if the temperatures are extremely cold—which for some could be 14 degrees fahrenheit plus windchill and humidity or 0 degrees fahrenheit in a dry climate for others—consider wearing a more robust protectiveface mask, especially for intense workouts. consult your primary care or sports medicine physician before choosing the best method for your health. “it’s paramount to havehydrationand make sure your hydration is available—and doesn’t freeze—through a run or race,” says like and explains, after taking a drink from abladder, “blow the fluid back into bladder, so it doesn’t freeze in the pipe. the mouth piece can freeze, too, and you often need to squeeze it and break up the ice.” nutrition barscan also turn into a brick that are difficult or impossible to bite into. like’s solution: “before your run, chop up your fuel into smaller, bite-sized pieces.” dworecki adds that keeping yourfuelandhydrationclose to the body can prevent it from freezing. “i’ll wear the bladder under myjacketand run the tube through my sleeve. i bring extra calories, because when you run low on energy in winter, you can get cold. also, addingelectrolytesto your hydration lowers the freezing point of water,” she says. this women’s pack has two soft bladders and plenty of additional pockets and pouches. though it doesn’t come with bottles, this backpack can hold a water reservoir as well as extra gear you may need out on the trail. have easy access to all your essentials on long runs or races with nathan’s lightweight running vest. an affordable hydration vest complete with two soft flasks and other minimal storage needs. “i almost always have someone come with me and that’s usually arun buddyfrom my local trailrun group,” says gibbons. dworecki suggests the same protocol. whether you’re on a solo run or with a group, make sure your family, roommates, or friends know yourroute planand when to expect you home, gibbons and like agree. looking for a spot to put these tips into action? these trails, that span the country, offer a scenic spot to chase miles. washington’s snoqualmie area is one of dworecki’s favorites for winter trail runs. “the area can get a lot of snow, especially in mid-winter, and is full of scenic trails with fantastic views such askendall peak lakes,” an 8.3-mile route with 1,871 feet of ascent, she says. “for typically less snow for a winter run in the same region,mt. siis a popular trail that can be crowded in the warmer months, so the winter can be an excellent time to go.” “the superiorhiking trailis remote ungroomed singletrack—it’s heaven on earth. the 260-mile route goes to the ancient sawtooth mountains, along lake superior, and is incredibly beautiful,” says gibbons."
"in minneapolis, her favorite spot for winter trail runs istheodore wirth regional park, with “huge singletrack—you can be in the city and in the woods and wilderness,” she says. near the state capitol, head tomatthews winters parkfor loops or out-and-back trail runs adjacent to red rocks park and amphitheater. or venture to thenordic ski capital of colorado, crested butte, to run on the groomed nordic trails that allow foot travel, surrounded by 13,000-foot snow-painted peaks. check out thegreen mountain trails, a singletrack network where the annualsnow devil ultra snowshoe raceis hosted in vermont, eight miles north of killington. morgan tilton writes about the outdoors with a focus on travel, industry news, and human endurance. her work is featured in more than 70 publications, and she’s a recipient of many north american travel journalists association awards, including double-awards for the essays, “wild & broken: a first sup descent of utah’s escalante river” and “a wild space.” morgan grew up mountain biking, hiking, and playing in colorado’s san juan mountains before moving to crested butte, in the adjacent range. the 5 best hiking shoes for 2024 the best trail running gear the 8 best headlamps for runners running shoe labor day sale 2024 tested and reviewed: nnormal kjerag the best trail running shoes a guide to trail running for beginners adidas enters the trail super shoe war runner’s world shoe awards 2024 - trail shoes tested and reviewed: altra timp 5 trail running tips for beginners and experts tested and reviewed: topo athletic mt-5 a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"the time before menopause can be long, uncomfortable, and confusing. we break down some misconceptions about the transition, so you know what to expect and can get a handle on symptoms. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? perimenopause is a lot like puberty. it’s a hormonal process with many physical and emotional repercussions and a timeline all its own. likewise, every woman experiences perimenopause differently, explains shona hendricks, a johannesburg, south africa-based run coach and head of the female athlete program atcoachparry.com, who works primarily with peri- andpostmenopausal runners. because perimenopause itself is so amorphous, women have a lot of confusion and questions about this time of their lives. to that point, 41-year-oldrecord-setting ultrarunner,camille herronspoke directly to this issue in a recentinstagrampost. she described her experience as “all over the place and an unknown.” she’s not alone in feeling this way. according to a2022 online surveyof more than 900 women currently experiencing perimenopause, more than 60 percent felt “not informed at all.” the most common symptoms mentioned by the women were mood swings, brain fog, andfatigue, but those were just a few of many—and women can feel any number of combinations of the wide range of symptoms. because the symptoms of perimenopause vary so widely andwhenwomen experience these side effects can also be drastically different, many women don’t always identify that changes in theirsleepor mood are related to perimenopause. instead, a woman tries to cure one symptom while separating it from others. this can prevent women from successfully finding solutions. “it’s helpful to know what to expect before we’re even there, or just when we’re entering it, so that you’re not wondering, am i just going crazy? am i just depressed?”anna barbieri, m.d., ob-gyn, integrative medicine physician, nams-certified menopause practitioner, and a clinical assistant professor at the mount sinai hospital in new york city tellsrunner’s world. to that end, this guide to perimenopause can help you recognize and manage your symptoms, while also maintaining your fitness and maybe even having your best performances, just likeherron. according to a 2016articlepublished in thejournal of women’s health, perimenopause is a term that describes the “menopausal transition,” the time between having a monthly period and having no period. this transition is not at all immediate, on a schedule, reliable, or quick. “there are no markers, there’s no specific age necessarily, and there are no blood tests that are done to identify this time,” barbieri says. most commonly, though, perimenopause starts between the ages of 40 and 44 and can last up to 10 years. however, some women’s symptoms begin in their late 30s. until you enter perimenopause, estrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall in a very predictable and mannered way. “that all changes during menopause,”mary jane minkin, m.d., a north american menopause society certified clinician and codirector of the sexuality, intimacy and menopause for cancer survivors program at the smilow cancer center in new haven, connecticut tellsrunner’s world."
"whatever your age, you’ll only know you’re experiencing perimenopause when you feel small differences in your body, and not just when it comes to your period. for example, you may not run quite asfastor you may feel like you have a little lesspowerandstrength. other areas that might change? your sleep, body composition, and mood. change—and the change—should not be feared. especially because runners and other active women are fortunate in that they are already engaged in the first step to managing symptoms of perimenopause: exercise. while a 2020studypublished inthe journals of gerontologyfound that women’s strength and power declined significantly during the menopausal transition, women who remainedphysically activewere able to minimize some of the changes. the key is adapting your workouts not only forperformance, but also to find relief from the results of changing hormone levels like sleep issues, mood swings, and strength losses. to help you navigate this confusing time, we sifted through the misinformation to bring you common myths and the truth about perimenopause and its symptoms, what you may expect from this time of your life, and some first-line solutions for addressing the changes. myth 1: erratic periods are the main symptom of perimenopause first steps toward a solution: talk to your doctor about perimenopause and herbal sleep supplements runners need their sleep torecoverfrom one workout and have the energy for the next. and while it’s typical to have abad night of sleephere and there, if you wake up in the middle of the night on a regular basis—and you’re in your late 30s or early 40s—you should talk to your doctor about perimenopause. progesterone, a hormone that predominantly works with the reproductive system and acts on neurotransmitter pathways in the brain, fluctuates throughout the month because of themenstrual cycle, and it has been shown to affect women’s ability to sleep well. a 2023articlein thejournal of the endocrine society, for example, says that reproductive hormones, such as progesterone, play a role in sleep quality throughout a woman’s life. while progesterone typically has sleep-promoting effects, a steep decline in this hormone (which can happen throughout perimenopause) can cause sleep disruptions, according to the article. your doctor can help you figure out the best way to address your changing hormones and subsequent sleep issues (along with other perimenopause symptoms you may be experiencing). but both minkin and barbieri also recommend trying herbal supplements, which is also worth asking your medical provider about. minkin recommendsremifemin good night, a german black cohosh supplement that also contains herbs shown to influence sleep, including valerian root extract, lemon balm extract, and hops strobile. also, studies have shown thathormone replacement therapy(hrt) can help reduce the perimenopause symptoms that lead to interrupted sleep, including night sweats and other issues. there are two types of hrt, one that women can apply locally to the vagina and a systemic type taken orally or as a patch. taking hrt requires a detailed discussion with your doctor about your medical history and symptoms, as well as the potential side effects of these medications."
"myth 2: perimenopause only affects reproductive hormones first steps toward a solution: assess your eating plan, practice mind-body exercise, and consider taking adaptogens the authors of a 2021 longitudinalstudypublished infrontiers in global women’s health,stated that while estrogen and progesterone decline during perimenopause, cortisol increases. when the reproductive hormones—estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone—begin to unreliably fluctuate during perimenopause, another hormone, cortisol, responds to these alterations in ways that can make women experience mood swings and other physical changes, like increasedbelly fat. this type of fat releasesinflammatorymolecules and contributes to the development of several conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. while cortisol increases during exercise and may even improve performance—it is, after all, “the running away from the tiger hormone,” barbieri says—chronically elevated cortisol levels can increasefatigue, turningtraining runsinto slogs that feel as if you’re traveling through mud. chronically elevated cortisol can also result in psychological symptoms such as irritability and potentially depressive symptoms. in fact,researchhas shown that women who experience mood disorders, such as depression, may see a rise in symptoms during perimenopause, which may be related to cortisol levels. fortunately, research also points to the ways women can deal with the relationship between stress, perimenopause, andmood. for example, one article published in 2021 infocus, says that diet plays a key role in mood disorder management. the authors point to research that links a higher saturated fat consumption to depression. barbieri suggests making sure you give yourself adequate time to recover from intense workouts to allow yourcortisollevels to come back down. she also suggests limiting foods that result in blood sugar spikes and dips (such as added sugars and processed foods), as this can also affect cortisol levels, according toresearch. another proven way to reducecortisol levels? mindfulness practices such asyogaandmeditation. incorporating these routines between your intense workouts will not only give you active recovery time, but could help to mitigate the cortisol bump. finally, tryadaptogens, says barbieri, which are herbs such as ginseng,turmeric,ashwagandha, and holy basil that may reduce feelings of stress. let your doctor know if you want to try these supplements, as they aren’t regulated by the fda despite being medicinal. be patient, too, as you manage your stress symptoms. “changing one’s cortisol curve is not an overnight project,” barbieri says. “it may take months.” myth 3: forgetfulness and brain fog are inevitable first steps toward a solution: continue exercising perimenopause marks the beginning of falling estrogen levels, and estrogen doesn’t only exist in your reproductive system. most cells in the body have estrogen receptors, including the brain, minkin explains. the brain relies on estrogen for higher cognitive function, according to a 2015articleinphysiology reviews. estrogen fluctuation affects muscle firing patterns and can create feelings of brain fog and lack of motivation,stacy t sims, ph.d., a new zealand female athlete performance physiologist and co-author ofroartellsrunner’s world. while it’s difficult for doctors to quantify brain fog, cognitive complaints, including reduced attention span and memory, are associated with perimenopause, according to a 2021researchpublished inclimacteric. “i went through [perimenopause] very early, at 42,” says barbieri. “and i thought i had a brain tumor."
"and i’m a gynecologist. i had a brain mri, the whole thing. part of me [didn’t] want to accept that my life [could] be so affected by my own hormones, part of me wanted to believe that i [could] get over it in my own head.” to address brain fog, barbieri suggestsstrength trainingand regular exercise. research backs up thebenefits of exercise for brain health. for example, one2022 paperfromclimactericsuggests lifestyle intervention (including diet and exercise) for preventing dementia and improving cognition, and points to a link between higher cardiovascular fitness and lowerdementia risk. because of research like this, sims suggests that midlife is a great time for women who haven’t beenweightliftingto add strength training to their routine. if you’re picking up weights, it’s important to note that estrogen modulatesmuscle recoveryand propensity to injury, says barbieri. so if you feel more joint pain or need more time to recover after runs andstrength workouts, these might also besymptoms of perimenopauseand a clue to take it easy when your body calls for it. myth 4: gaining weight is part of the process first steps toward a solution: try interval workouts and weight training studies showthat declining estrogen levels contribute to the loss oflean muscle mass, which can lead to changes inbody composition. body composition is the body’s amount of fat relative to fat-free mass, including muscle and bone (this is different than weight). “we have to adjust the way we train to get similar or the same sort of outputs [as we did before menopause],” says hendricks. sims recommendsinterval trainingduring perimenopause and beyond. that could mean either truesprint interval training(sit) or truehigh-intensity interval training(hiit). both put a high demand on your muscles which signals your brain to produce more human growth hormone (hgh) and increase testosterone, which helps you build and maintain muscle mass. sims offers some workout details: also, just as barbieri mentioned in regard to brain fog,strength trainingis also important tomaintain muscle mass, as adults begin to lose muscle at a rate of 3 to 8 percent per decade after 30, according to areviewincurrent opinion in clinical nutritional and metabolic care. to support both the muscle-building aspect of your workouts and healthy body composition, barbieri recommends at least 0.8 grams ofproteinper pound of bodyweight, which is in line with the amount recommended forathletes. also, both experts say to make sure you are eatinghealthy fats, as well asfiber-containing, colorful vegetables to support overall health and body composition. in the face of symptoms like brain fog and changes in body composition, many women are hesitant to acknowledge that “it’s just [their] hormones” because they think those words sound like an excuse, as if they are admitting to some great female weakness. but it’s not, it’s biology, says barbieri. embracing these changes that come with age may help you achieve another positive aspect of getting older: happiness. a2022 aarpstudy found that older people are happier than both younger people and those in midlife. “i feel like for so many women, the process of perimenopause itself is like an endurance athletic event,” barbieri adds."

"why you might want a pair of these maximalist trainers in your shoe rotation. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? anything that promises to make running more comfortable is an enticing sell to runners whosefeetpound pavement, track, andtreadmillfor many hours every week. comfort and bounce are the big allure of shoes with maximal padding. in fact, cushioned running shoes continue to surge in popularity. visit your local running store, and you’ll encounter a slew of cushioned options, from brands includingbrooks,nike,hoka,saucony, andaltra. but do these shoes offer benefits for performance? we dug into the research and spoke with three experts on the pros and cons of cushioned running shoes. here’s what you need to know. the definition of “cushioned shoe” is one of those things that falls under the category of “we know it when we see it,” because there is no official definition or description of cushioned shoe. cushioning “exists on a spectrum,”matthew boyd, a physiotherapist and run coach in alberta, canada, tellsrunner’s world.a shoe such as vibram’s fivefingers provides pretty much zero cushioning whilenike’s alphaflycontains a maximum amount. “then there’s a spectrum in between,” boyd explains, with most shoes falling into a middle range, or what he describes as “typical” cushioning. so, while there isn’t a specific set of criteria for what constitutes a cushioned shoe, they do have a few common attributes. first, cushioned shoes have soft, often thick, padding in the midsole, which is designed to increase shock absorption,bill mccann, d.p.m., a new hampshire-based podiatrist, tellsrunner’s world.compared to shoes with minimal padding, they feel softer and more comfortable on your feet. second, many of today’s cushioned shoes trend towards a maximalist design, featuring additional layers of foam and other material to make them “higher stack” shoes, meaning the foot plate, or base, sits higher off the ground, stephen m. pribut, d.p.m., a washington d.c.-based podiatrist, tellsrunner’s world. thanks to materials such as eva (a plastic and rubber foam), these shoes are light and offer more energy return, mccann points out. in other words, you feel a bounce when you run in them. for certain runners, cushioned shoes can deliver on the promise of making the activity more comfortable. in particular, cushioned shoes may help those with limited range of motion in theirankle,knee, and/orhipjoints, mccann says. that’s because the softness of the shoe triggers a response in your joints and they stiffen to help you stay balanced and upright. without this response, runners may feel pain if a joint moves beyond a comfortable range, he adds. cushioned running shoes may also benefitultrarunnersbecause the cushioning is less abrasive against the skin and subcutaneous tissue, reducing the risk of blisters andfoot aches, boyd explains. some people assume that heavier runners in particular benefit from cushioned shoes because the soft surface lessens the ground impact forces on their joints. boyd points to a randomized controlled trial of 848 recreational runners,published in 2019, that debunked this school of thought. the researchers concluded that cushioned shoes provided no protective benefit to heavier runners."
"on the contrary, the studydidfind a protective effect for lighter runners, but it was fairly small. additionally, research has shown that some highly cushionedsuper shoes, such as the nike vaporfly, significantly improvesperformance. however, “it’s not necessarily the cushioning that’s helping,” boyd explains. it’s more likely other factors, such as the foam having a certain rebound, the carbon plate, and that they’re extremely light, he says. that said, many runners benefit from putting a maximally cushioned shoe inrotationalongside a moderately cushioned shoe and a more minimally cushioned shoe, boyd explains. that’s because training with varying degrees of cushioning can increase your tolerance to different stresses and thus reduce your overall risk ofinjury. the key here is variety: for cushioned shoes to be helpful in this context, “you’d need the combo of all the shoes, not just the one shoe,” boyd says. one big downside of cushioned shoes is they may hamperrunning economy. that’s because increased padding often causes people to land with a slightly straighter knee and with a little harder of aheel strikethat’s further out in front of them, boyd explains. often, but not always, runners will also adopt a lowercadencein a cushioned shoe, boyd adds. “all of these things are generally seen as less helpful when you’re looking at improving running economy,” boyd says. moreover, the shock absorption of cushioned shoes can hinder your body’s ability to feel the ground and cause your muscles to activate in response later than normal, which can ultimatelyincreasethe force of impact on your joints, pribut explains. indeed, a small 2018studyinvolving 12 male runners, found that running in maximalist cushioned shoes increased impact loading compared to conventional shoes, especially at high speeds. plus, having your joints stiffen in response to cushioned shoes can cause discomfort for some runners, mccann says. boyd agrees, saying the biomechanical changes induced by cushioned shoes can exacerbate existing pains andinjuriesfor some athletes. for example, people withankle sprainsor posterior tibial tendinitis (shin splints) would likely do better with a more moderately (versus maximally) cushioned shoe, says pribut, though this isn’t a one-size-fits-all prescription. lastly, heavier cushioned shoes with minimal return can be inefficient, though, as mentioned there are plenty of newer cushioned shoes with lightweight designs and good return. “it really depends on the material,” mccann says. in the end, cushioned shoes can change yourbiomechanicsin a way that is helpful for some ailments and unhelpful for others, boyd says. sussing out which specific injuries a cushioned shoe could help is nuanced and depends on individual biomechanics, he explains, but in general, runners should avoid grabbing a pair of plush kicks as a solution to their aches and pains. if you’ve previously run well and avoided injuries with cushioned shoes, then feel free to stick with them. “the most important thing is probably what’s worked well in the past,” says pribut. but if you haven’t given them a whirl before? consider opting for a more middle-of-the-road shoe first, he says. that said, serious runners may want to consider having multiple shoes in their rotation that offer varying degrees of cushioning, mccann says."
"like boyd explained, this can increase your biomechanical tolerance to different stresses and ultimately reduce overall injury risk. probably the biggest risk for a running injury is abrupt and drastic change, whether that’s to yourtraining planor to your shoes, boyd says. “if you’re used to a certain amount of cushioning in your shoes, deviating significantly from that and doing it quite abruptly, that’s a risky strategy,” he says, as it will alter your biomechanics. if you’ve never donned cushioned shoes before, but are curious to try out a pair, wear them for no more than 10 to 20 percent of your totalweekly volume, suggests boyd. if you’re feeling good after a few weeks, you can slip them on more frequently, though again, your best bet is to rotate through a diverse stable of trainers versus wearing the same pair for every run. jenny is a boulder, colorado-based health and fitness journalist. she’s been freelancing forrunner’s worldsince 2015 and especially loves to write human interest profiles, in-depth service pieces and stories that explore the intersection of exercise and mental health. her work has also been published byself,men’s journal, andcondé nast traveler, among other outlets. when she’s not running or writing, jenny enjoys coaching youth swimming, rereadingharry potter, and buying too many houseplants. the best adidas running shoes for every runner why you should race in the diadora gara carbon october running shoe deals 2024 the best october prime day running shoe deals 2024 find a smooth ride in the adidas ultraboost 5x mount to coast: ultra shoes for road warriors a new balance shoe for the marathon track star the best running shoes for men find protection on the trails in the altra timp 5 the 6 best treadmill shoes for indoor running the 5 best hiking shoes for 2024 tested and reviewed: altra experience shoes a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"how to tell who’s legit and who’s just good at marketing. a nutrition pro can help you optimize yourfueling strategyand mitigate common running-related issues ranging from postworkoutenergycrashes to midrunbathroomtrips. but knowing who to trust with your health is tricky. “expert” is a relative term, and it turns out that the meaning of “nutritionist” varies depending on who you’re talking to. so, how do you know who’s legit? for advice on finding a qualified practitioner (and knowing who to avoid), we spoke with three registered dietitians about the difference between a dietitian versus nutritionist. here’s what you need to know. the difference between a nutritionist and a dietitian comes down to education, experience, and credentials. registered dietitians (rd) are trained at the university level, andstarting in 2024, they must have at least a graduate-level degree to be eligible to take thecommission on dietetic registration’s (cdr)exam to earn the rd designation. prospective registered dietitians also participate in an internship where they accrue between 900 and 1,200 hours of supervised practice. acertified nutrition specialist (cns)has similar training to a registered dietitian but is accredited through theamerican nutrition association (ana), which requires that test takers have a master of science or doctoral degree in nutrition or a related field. like registered dietitians, they must also complete around 1,000 hours of supervised practice. both registered dietitians and certified nutrition specialists are required to obtain separate licenses in the states where they practice and regularly earn continuing education credits to keep their accreditations. the requirements or qualifications for a “nutritionist” or “nutrition coach” are far less rigorous. in fact, there are none. “anyone can call themselves a nutritionist,” saysmarie spano, ms, rd, cscs, cssd, sports dietitian. “there’s no regulation behind that term.” some nutritionists earn certificates through universities or private companies, but coursework varies from one institution to the next, and there are no universal standards for program evaluation or testing. some nutritionists forgo formal education altogether, relying on their own research or personal experience to inform their work. if you have any nutrition-related illnesses, a nutritionist who’s not an rd or cns technically is not allowed to treat you—that includesmeal planning, diet recommendations, orsupplementation. “let’s say someone has hypertension ordiabetesor even gastrointestinal conditions. it’s not legal for [health coaches or nutritionists] in many states to intervene,” saysgabriela barreto, ms, rd, cssd. a nutritionist can provide general dietary recommendations to people with uncomplicated health histories. and for people who need a little extra support as they attempt to shift their behaviors around food, a nutrition coach may offer the encouragement and accountability you need. but again, there’s no assurance that a nutritionist’s advice is backed by formal education or rooted in science. “a dietitian is a board-certified expert on food and nutrition,” says joanna gregg, rd, food data curator atmyfitnesspal. “dietitians go through schooling to become experts on the science of food and how it affects human health."
"they’re trained in medical nutrition therapy and nutrition counseling for a wide range of demographics and can be certified further in a specialty such as sports, weight management, oncology,disordered eating, or pediatric nutrition.” dietitians who specifically work with runners help their clients improve their performance, train more effectively, and feel better during andafter workouts. this often starts withfueling recommendationsthat are more personalized. “a dietitian who understands energy output is going to listen to what you’re doing every day. they’re going to understand your speed and your distance and be able to estimate how much energy you’re using,” and, therefore, how manycaloriesyou need to consume, barreto says. they can also monitor your progress, recognize trends you may not notice, and continually fine-tune yourfueling strategies. “we can also help with proper nutrient timing,” spano says. runners are more than familiar with preracecarbo-loading, but they often drop the ball during therecoveryperiod when a bowl ofpastais less appealing. “especially when it comes to an endurance-based athlete, that hour after training is a really pivotal time to get in nutrients,” barreto says, noting that dietitians who work with athletes are well-versed in sportsnutrition productsand can pick the most appropriate drinks, shakes, gels, and bars based on their clients’ needs. for some runners, fueling and nutrient timing aren’t their most pressing concerns. both spano and barreto often work with athletes who have food fear or disordered eating habits, as well as other medical nutrition issues that can interfere with running. “we can also help with blood testing or other testing that may be needed to ensure that the individual is healthy,” spano says. while hiring a dietitian is an investment—rates vary, but you can probably expect to pay at least $150 per hour without insurance—it could save you time and money in the long run. there’s no shortage of free nutritional advice online, but culling through the clutter to find information that’s accurate and relevant to your body, sport, and personal goals is daunting. “you can spend all day on the internet looking up stuff, but it doesn’t mean that you can put it all together if you’re not an expert in that area,” spano says. even the most nutrition-conscious runners make mistakes. barreto notes that runners who use online activity calculators are often undereating by hundreds of calories, which leads tofatigue,headaches, and subpar performance. spano agrees that undereating is a common problem among runners, especially women. she also finds that runners who are hyper-focused on eatinghealthy foodsare often consuming too muchfiber, which can lead to gastrointestinal distress. after consulting with a dietitian, you may also find that you’re spending money unnecessarily on nutrition-related products that you don’t actually need. “a sports dietitian can help with efficacious supplements. and it’s not just about which supplements work. oftentimes, i’m weeding out things thatdon’twork,” spano says. “so a runner might come to me, and i’ll say, ‘you don’t need to take this, this, and this.’ and they’re like, ‘oh, thank god."
"i’m tired of doing this routine.’ so, we’re helping them save money and time and wasted effort.” finding the right dietitian is a lot like finding the right doctor or therapist; some are more qualified than others, and it may take time to link up with a practitioner who feels like the right fit for you and your needs. use these tips for a successful search. you can always google “dietitians near me,” but if you want to narrow your search, check out theacademy of nutrition and dietetics’sonlinedatabaseof nutrition experts. you can search by location, specialty, and insurance, and each practitioner’s contact information and credentials are clearly listed. remember: there are no regulations for the terms “nutritionist” or “nutrition coach.” look for a professional who’s a registered dietitian (rd) or certified nutrition specialist (cns). the scope of nutrition is broad, so dietitians tend to specialize in one area. choose someone who, in addition to having rd or cns in their title, also has cssd, which stands for “certified specialist in sports dietetics.” this indicates that they’ve undergone additional training to work with athletes. “have a phone call. talk to them and ask them how they work with clients, and tell them about your specific needs. ask them about their experience,” spano suggests. and make sure they understand your specific population, as the needs of anultramarathonerwill differ from those of a triathlete or someone who’s training for theirfirst 10k. “there are little ins and outs to every sport and population, even if you drill down to how you carry your gel packs. somebody who knows the sport will understand what’s realistic in different situations,” spano adds. symptoms of magnesium deficiency what are the benefits of creatine for runners? exactly what to eat before a marathon the benefits of spirulina can intermittent fasting help you lose weight? foods high in vitamin e that boost recovery should runners always avoid ultraprocessed foods? what fruit is in season now? should you eat before or after a run? signs of vitamin d deficiency the best energy-dense foods for runners 8 healthy eating myths a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"coaches, pro runners, and shoe specialists offer their best advice to make the most of your miles. if you’re convinced of all thebenefits you’ll gain from running, but aren’t sure how toget startedor even what you need to know before you head out the door, we got you. we chatted with coaches, pro runners, and shoe specialists for their best beginner running tips. before yousign up for a 5kor even buy a new pair ofrunning shoes, follow this advice for starting out on the right foot—and make running a lifelong habit. when you’re first starting out,paceshould be the least of your worries. just lace up your shoes, hit the road, and try to hold a pace you can maintain for your entire run. “focus on one mile at a time,” says former pro triathlete and ironman champion,linsey corbin. “you never know what is going to happen up the road. running one mile at a time—and not focusing on the whole picture—helps you stay focused on the process versus the outcome.” if you find yourself too focused on how fast you’re running, professional ultrarunnerkatie asmuthrecommends going out for atrail run. the hills, roots, and rocks will help you “forget your pace and your worries, and enjoy the scenery around you,” she says. according to corbin, “comparison is the thief of joy.” when you’re worried about what the runners around you are doing, you lose focus on your own personal journey. “the best results come when you focus on yourself. looking around at what everyone else is doing is almost guaranteed that you will never be satisfied,” says corbin. danny mackey, coach of the brooks beasts professional track club, echoes corbin’s sentiments: “be mindful that everyone progresses and improves at different rates. some days, you have to balance what’s best for you. that might meanrunning sloweror quicker compared to another person. running is a lifelong sport, so compare against yourself first.” like it or not,running is hard. you’re putting your entire body to work, from yourarmsto yourfeet. once you understand that, it’s easier to push yourself to the limit. that doesn’t mean you shouldalwaysfeel uncomfortable.easy runs, for example, are meant to feel easy. but when you’re out for aharder runor running your first race, you have to be okay with the challenge. “how you feel while running isn’t always predictable, so dial in what you can control,” says asmuth. the goal is to be uncomfortable, but in command of your body. in order to run happy, healthy, and consistently, you should have a good pair (or two) ofrunning shoes. everyone’sstrideis different, which makes picking the right shoe a personalized experience. your local specialty running store is the best place to go for a fitting. the staff members are specifically trained to properlysize your feet, determine whether youoverpronate, and inform you on the different brands and styles out there. michael zabrodski, vice president of operations atphiladelphia runner, warns new runners not to be swayed by fashion: “making sure it is the right shoe for your specific needs is paramount."
"if the shoe doesn’t perform for you, then it doesn’t really matter what it looks like.” running coachyusuf jeffersbelieves that “there isn’t an athlete out there who hasn’t experienced some form ofinjuryat one point or another while practicing their sport.” therefore, it’s important to know when your body is at it’s limit. when feeling unnaturalaches or painson a run, it’s better to stop early and try again tomorrow than to force through. “running is a highly repetitive motion sport, it leaves one particularly vulnerable to overuse andovertraining injuries,” says jeffers. so when you feel like you might be overdoing it, refer to the next tip. professional 1500-meter runnerdavid ribichof the nike union athletics club compares runners to batteries: “at full charge we have maximum capabilities, ready for any demand that comes our way. if we work hard and get our bodies’ battery life down before we recharge, we eitherovertrain, getinjured, or feel bad.” however, it doesn’t always make sense to take a completerest day. sometimes it’s just helpful to shake things up andcross-train—whether on a bike or in the pool orgym. “movement is medicine,” says 25k american record holderparker stinson. “your body and mind will appreciate you taking the day off from running, but still finding a way to get some blood flow into thosesore muscles.” running is a sport that requires diligence and dedication over time to see continued success. however, you have to be patient whenbuilding up your mileage. there’s no shortcut—jumping right to high mileage can lead to injury. james randon, professional 1500-meter runner, suggests that when you first start running, focus on the number ofdays you run a weekrather than the length of each run. once you get up to five or six days a week, you can gradually increase your mileage. once you get to aconsistentmileage, randon recommends tracking your training using an app likestravaor finalsurge. “you will find patterns that may have lead to a recent flair up or injury,” says randon. “using this data, you can quickly isolate what causes hiccups in training or may be preventing further mileage increases.” running is often seen as an individual sport. sometimes, it can even feel lonely. that’s whyelliott heath, coach of the bowerman track club elite, recommends running with a group. “the runs will go by faster, you and your running partners will hold each other accountable to a regular routine, and you will all improve together,” he says. the best way to find a running group is to head to your local running store. they typically set up group runs or can point you to any number ofrunning clubsin your area. chris hatler is a writer and editor based in philadelphia, pennsylvania, but before joining runner’s world and bicycling, he was a pro runner for diadora, qualifying for multiple u.s. championships in the 1500 meters. at his alma mater the university of pennsylvania, chris was a multiple-time ivy league conference champion and sub-4 minute miler."

"plus, what training variable you probably want to pay attention to more than weekly mileage. it’s a common ritual to sandwich your runs between a warmup and cooldown. and throughout your week, these miles add up and can count toward yourweekly mileage—atraining metricthat can help you track your progress. but just because youcancount them, doesn’t mean youshould. some coaches, experts, or runners argue that these easy miles are not stimulating enough to count toward that weekly mileage number, considering you should runwarmupsandcooldownsat a super easy pace that doesn’t leave youfatigued. so we spoke to coaches on both sides of the weekly mileage argument to find out what exactly counts toward this goal number. we also got the scoop on the significance of weekly mileage and expert advice on why you need warmups and cooldowns and what they should look like. sage canaday, ultramarathoner and run coach athigher running, explains that weekly mileage is an important tool that runners can use to evaluate progress over time. “at higher running, we often emphasize mileage as part of the totaltraining loadstress and how we program a training plan,” he says. weekly mileage is often monitored to make sure an athlete isn’tovertrainingor risking injury from trying torun too muchtoo soon in a training cycle, canaday adds. he believes that weekly mileage also helps endurance runners build anaerobic base, and that buildingenduranceand stamina comes from consistent weekly mileage totals met over time. don’t get so carried away in becoming a mileage junkie, though. “weekly mileage is a general metric,” saysmegan wagenaar, assistant cross-country coach at portland state andbowerman track club elitemember. it doesn’t need to be super specific; if you run 6.8 miles, you can log seven. there are a lot of different metrics that you need to look at with training, and weekly mileage is just one of them, wagenaar adds. “it is one of the metrics that you can look at when you are just looking at generaltime on your feet. it is not the most important metric. it is just one of the pieces,” wagenaar explains. for all runners—beginners,half marathoners,marathoners, and elites—the key is to look at the bigger picture, wagenaar continues. “mileage is a supportive role, not the main character,” she says. weekly mileage can be used as a general tool to spot trends in training, and see how muchstressyou’re putting on your body, but it’s not going to automatically get you apr. “it really depends on your goal,” says wagenaar. she explains that if you want to race for completion, then warmup and cooldown mileage is definitely countable. if you have a specific goal toget faster, then intensity should be your focus over mileage anyway (more on that below!). say you’re doing a seven-mileinterval workoutone day during yourhalf marathon training. of course, you’re going to count the two-mile warmup toward your total mileage. three days later, you go out for an easy eight-milelong runbut the warmup consists ofdynamic stretchingand a half-mile jog. do you still count that half-mile along with all the miles you ran that week?"
"canaday counts every tenth of a mile. he suggests counting not only warmup and cooldown mileage, but also anyrest jogs in between interval workouts. “if you’re out there moving around and promoting blood flow and getting the heart rate up into zone 1 or higher, then you are putting in mileage,” says canaday. ​​he explains that total mileage—warmups and cooldowns included—can be increased over time in order to build strength and speed, ultimately boosting performance. research also shows that running high mileage may make you more efficient and therefore, expend less energy during your workouts. astudypublished in thejournal of applied psychologyin 2016 examined two groups of runners who had already been running for six months: one that consistently ran 30 or more miles per week and another that ran less than 10 miles per week. the researchers monitored the activity of the thigh muscles and knee joint movements when all runners tackled four different speeds. the high-mileage group showed neuromuscular changes that improved theirefficiency, allowing them to do less work when covering the same distance as the low-mileage group. they also had more spring-like reactions in the lower leg tendons that helped propel them forward. and these advantages were even more evident at faster speeds. keeping track of your hard mileage—your quality miles—is “the important piece of the puzzle that a lot of people may be missing,” wagenaar says. and a warmup or cooldown does not necessarily contribute to quality training time, she explains. wagenaar also suggests that intensity is the more important metric, compared to mileage, when it comes torunning faster. “the more time you spend closer to at or around race pace, the better you’re going to get at it,” she says. intensity work includesthreshold pace,speed work, andrace pace, and you can track intensity effort in either minutes or miles, according to wagenaar. in any given quality workout, she recommends aiming for about 20 minutes of intensity work. wagenaar also suggests gradually building intensity just as you would increase weekly mileage—whether that means pushing your speed or hittingrace pacemore often—when looking to progress or during focused training. the 80/20 rule is a good ratio to follow for tracking intensity: aim for 80 percent of training made up of warmups, cooldowns, easy runs, and long runs, while 20 percent is all the work you do at or near race pace, wagarnaar suggests. research also indicates that training with more speed and fewer miles can get you that shiny new pr. astudypublished inphysiological reportsin 2018, involving 20 male and female runners, looked at adding 10 extra sessions of speed training (five to 10 reps of 30-second max-effort intervals) and reducing weekly training volumes by 36 percent for six weeks. by doing so, the runners’ average 10k time improved by 3.2 percent, which looks like a 50-minute 10k brought down to about 48:30. every aspect of training should have a purpose, and warmups and cooldowns are no exception. in short,warmupsprepare our muscles for the run ahead, whilecooldownsallow us to recover from a hard effort."
"research backs up the benefits of both practices: a systematic review andmeta-analysispublished in 2010 inthe journal of strength and conditioning researchexamined 32 studies on the effects of warmup on athletic performance and found in 79 percent of the research included, performance improved after a warmup. cooldowns help to flush out the muscles and get the blood moving, according to wagenaar. and anarrative reviewpublished insports medicinein 2018 examined the effects of active cooldowns, and found they can potentially enhance next-day performance. your warmup or cooldown regimen can vary from day to day. canaday recommends that athletes run for at least 10 to 15 minutes before a quality workout. depending on the runner’s fitness level, this can range anywhere from a half-mile to two miles or more. canaday generally suggests that the higher the intensity of the workout, the more elaborate the warmup. “if you have something fairly intense like400-meter repeatsway faster than5k race pace, then i’d make sure the warmup jog is at least 10 to 20 minutes and that it includes somestridesafter some light dynamic stretching,” he says. for lower-intensity workouts, the warmup can be less elaborate. before atempo run, for example, canaday recommends 10 minutes of easy running; adding in strides and dynamic stretching is less critical. for cooldowns, aim for just five to 10 minutes of easy jogging. wagenaar explains that after a tough race, it may not be beneficial to push throughnauseaor other ailments, so a shortened jog cooldown or an easy walk may be best. kristine kearns, a writer and avid runner, joinedrunner’s worldandbicyclingin july 2024. she previously coached high school girls cross country and currently competes in seasonal races, with more than six years of distance training and an affinity for weightlifting. you can find her wearing purple, baking cupcakes, and visiting her local farmers market. tips to make consistent fitness progress benefits of zone 2 running how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week? avoid going out too fast in a race how to run slower on easy days all about running tests for improved performance all about the maf method how to run with knee arthritis and reduce the pain all about heart rate training stop worrying about pace so much in workouts leg turnover is key to faster running a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"build lifelong motivation, turn setbacks into prs, and crush her favorite workout. jess movold springs off her living room floor like a superhero taking flight. with a soft landing, she bounces back up 11 more times to complete the set of jumpsquats. she’s already led her instagram live audience through a series of dead bugs, jumpinglunges, and froggers, but cheers her followers on as if she has an extra set of lungs. “don’t stop, don’t cheat yourself,” movold implores. “if i can do it, you can do it! we can do it together!” through the 38-minute broadcast, seen by more than 75,000, she also thanks commenters for shout-outs—“glad you enjoy the coaching! five seconds to go…”she drops in training tips, like how to speed recovery between exercises—“biiiiiig inhale between efforts!” she even makes the case for not hating burpees during theburpees—“undeniable full-body strength!” movold started these wednesday strength sessions for runners in march, as the manhattan studios where she’d led strength and running classes closed for public health restrictions. in her typical undaunted manner, she took her classes into her apartment and invited the world to join her. now, the world is showing up. movold spent her childhood avoiding the long miles she now celebrates. every morning, her dad, and eventually her older sister, ran a three- to five-mile loop around their hometown of hermann, missouri, a one-stoplight town 90 minutes west of st. louis. movold steadfastly declined her dad’s invitations, all the while wondering how he was always so positivein the mornings. but as she entered junior high, she was drawn to the speed of her school’s track sprinters. movold loved the “run hard, but die fast” mentality of the workouts, and reached the state championships in the 4x200 relay as a senior. when she entered missouri state university after high school, movold focused on a career in fashion and forgot about running. her dedication earned her an internship at tommy hilfiger in new york city. but like most new york commuters, she was forced to play subway roulette, often finding herself on the losing end of delays, construction, and packed cars. her consolation prize: a sprint across four avenues to make it on time. “i started running like a crazy person in my intern outfit with heels in my bag,” movold says. the morning commutes inspired movold to run for more than the sake of punctuality. “i used to think you could only run on atreadmillor a path, but running to my office showed me that in a city, you have everywhere to run,” says movold. by the end of the summer, she’d logged so many miles that she had decided to train for her first marathon. movold turned that internship with tommy hilfiger into an entry-level job and then another job, and then another as she established herself in the fashion world. but the long hours and hustling to complete absurd requests—like finding her boss a steak and salad at 7:30 a.m., or delivering his weekend spending money via a helicopter—grated on movold."
"“i was basically anne hathaway inthe devil wears prada.” there was a bright spot: movold’s running habit from her intern days had stuck. colleagues asked her for training advice, and at photo shoots she’d convince curious photographers and models that despite their doubts,yes!they really could be runners. “i started to recognize that those were the only times i felt alive at work,” she says. in 2016, movold told her steak-for-breakfast boss that she was quitting. to her surprise, he challenged her. “he was playing me,” she says, “trying to get me to stay, saying he understood it was too challenging, too much pressure, that the mountain was too steep.” “i told him, no, it’s the wrong mountain.” as movold was exiting the fashion world, she also began working out at the fort, a gym in manhattan. just like the runners at her office, other athletes at the gym noticed her—and her endless enthusiasm for sweating until she was on the floor exhausted. a few asked if she was taking on clients to train, and she helped without thinking, or even asking for payment. “starting to coach was such a joy, nothing felt like work,” she says. movold realized she needed a more professional mind-set to succeed. and beyond billing, she earned certifications from the road runners club of america and the national academy of sports medicine to coach and train athletes. she’s since become a senior coach at the fort, in addition to joiningrunner’s worldand the mile high run club. her new career works a 5–9 schedule, she says with a laugh. normally she’d wake around 5 a.m. for her first client and finish when her final evening class wraps. the fashion world prepared her for the demanding hours, though none of her current clients make 10 p.m. requests for live goldfish. all day, her mood is unflinchingly upbeat: energized, she says, by each interaction with an athlete in need of guidance. “i’m a vessel for motivation for my athletes,” she says. “i find their ‘why’ and reflect it back.” with gyms still closed, movold is separated from her runners. but she’s undeterred, thriving even. “i never saw myself as a microphone-and-lights instructor, the center of attention,” she says. her days are still long, but in leadingher living room workouts, texting clients, and coaching runner’s world+ members, movold knows she’s climbing the right mountain. goals, like finishing a marathon, and structure, like a workout plan, are essential for guiding runners through a season. but movold says the key to maintaining a long-term relationship with running is finding what really drives you—whether it’s a new sense of confidence or getting off medication. “identifying this unlocks everything that’s possible for a runner,” says movold. that understanding of why you put on your running shoes can be used to hold yourself accountable when you’re distracted or discouraged by short-term goals. whether or not you nail a speed session, those inner passions will persist to drive you. whether it’s injury, missing a pr, or having a race—or season—canceled, failure is an inevitable part of running."
"but falling short of a goal doesn’t negate all the work put in along the way, says movold. “running is about learning about yourself and honing a skill over time so that each training cycle, race, and experience builds on what you’ve already accomplished.” all that physical and mental hard work will make future goals more attainable. “and if you’re still feeling that salty about it,” says movold, “use that as motivation to take training a little bit more seriously or fine-tune an aspect, like mobility, if an injury set you back.” in preparing to break three hours in her next marathon, movold keeps going back to this interval workout. getting the most out of it hinges on maintaining the right pace; you’re looking to run at or just below goal race pace, movold says. it should feel tough, but not impossible. start with an easy two-mile warmup, followed by eight 1k repeats at half-marathon to marathon goal pace. jog for two minutes to recover between each repeat. finish the workout with a two-mile cooldown. years ago, movold had a coach who she just didn’t connect with. she felt like she was never fast enough. rather than being internally motivated, she started running to impress him. “i ran every single run at race pace to fool myself. i didn’t accept my current level of fitness,” movold says. “i tried to rush it, which led to a stress fracture, not running the boston marathon, and being sidelined for two months.” it’s easy, movold says, to let the external pressures of social media and other people’s expectations work against you. but after her injury healed, she was able to find joy (and success) in running by accepting her fitness and avoiding the frustration of failing to meet unreasonable goals. reconnecting with running and making it a habit again is intimidating, says movold. “it’s disappointing to realize you’ve lost a step, and the fear of failure can creep in.” so movold tells athletes to start with a simple commitment to run for 30 minutes without paying attention to pace or distance. it’s how she got moving again after her stress fracture, she says, because it rebuilds the habit of regular runs without the distraction of past fitness markers. when they’re ready to start tracking progress, she’ll have them measure out their 30-minute run and then try to cover the distance faster the next week to create new goals as their fitness returns. everything you need to know about hip pain how to increase mileage running periodized training can help you hit your goals marathon pace charts for fine-tuning training first boston marathon?"

"it sucks having to wake up early when you don’treallyhave to, but when you do it for 10 days in a row, well the next thing you know, the 12th day you wake up before the alarm goes off and your body’s like, okay, put on yourshoesand get your ass out there, and it feels great. that part, for me, was a really big kick in the pants. it carried over into all of the other aspects of my life, from the way i treat my business to the way i think about time blocking to making sure i’m spending quality time with my kids. it’s all a matter of having a process and a plan and maintaining that discipline. running, for me, not only was the path to seeing that, but the results obtained from the running reinforced why the discipline’s important. i made it to the starting line in berlin feeling pretty good, and i finished in 4:44, almost a full hour faster than my previous personal record a decade ago. but i was just getting started. it was training for berlin that made me realize that there are these other five amazing races [theabbott world marathon majors], and i thought it was just a matter of signing up. i had no idea that for some of them, if you don’t get in based on time qualification, you’re out of luck... unless of course you run for charity. that’s when i learned aboutback on my feet, a non-profit with a mission to fight homelessness through fitness. i was able to raise funds, meet a bunch of great people, and i did four out of the six majors through that organization: london (april 2023), chicago (october 2023), new york (november 2023), and boston (april 2024). plus, the mission to end homelessness aligns really well with my career in real estate. in london, i knocked off another 25 minutes from my marathon pr and finished in 4:20. i knocked another 11 minutes off in chicago, finishing in 4:09. logistics-wise, i loved chicago. i did a boat tour and it was fun to do myshakeout runsalong the lake. and it didn’t hurt that my hotel was like two blocks from the starting line. at that point, honestly, i was a little bit tired. i probably got a little bit cocky. i missed a couple ofworkouts. so by the time new york rolled around, just a month after chicago, i tacked on time, finishing 4:48. but in new york, the people, the cheering, when you get on fifth avenue, you feel like a professional athlete. that is something that words can’t describe. for tokyo, which i just ran in february of this year, i raised money for the un high commission for refugees, the japanese chapter. they required fundraisers to raise about the equivalent of $600, but i told them i’d raise double that, and i think that’s why i got in. i thought it was going to go really well in tokyo."
"i had a good winter training session, but it was hotter than i anticipated and i finished in 4:54. finally, i ran boston this past april and it was one of the most memorable marathons, as i knew that my kids were waiting for me at the finish line. boston was a pretty epic course and the crowds were phenomenal from the start through each little township on the way to the center of boston. i finished at 4:54 and know that i can do better. i never thought i would get all six stars, but i committed to it, so i had to do it! over the course of this journey, i also lost 100 pounds. i had to get all new clothes. my body feels better; i look good in the mirror. mykneesdon’t hurt when i get out of bed. and it doesn’t get any better than my kids noticing i’m in better health and i can play with them longer. for me, the biggest thing was that all of this was for good. it was good for mymental health, it was good for me physically, and i raised a ton of money for charity. all of these things just add up into a really great win, and i’m excited to keep at it. specifically, i want to break 3:54, which is my brother’s pr. that was 25 years ago, but he’s like, “i’m still thefastest marathonerin the family.” we’re two competitive brothers, so part of me has to break 3:54 just so i can make him stop talking about it. i’ll probably run another marathon in 2025 but in the meantime, i’m interested in getting afaster half-marathontime and taking on other challenges like a 5k per day for a month. i went full circle from not doing any exercise to working really hard at getting better and faster and healthier. the best thing about running is it truly is one foot in front of the other, and you just have to keep at it. it’s those little gains that incrementally over time transcend into incredible results. there are going to be days that you’ve got to push through because you’ve just got to do it, but if you feel like you’ve tweaked something, don’t push it too hard and make theinjuryworse. it’s like the old wayne gretzky quote: “you miss 100 percent of the shots that you don’t take.” you have to believe in yourself, and you have to want to do it, whether it’s run yourfirst marathonor go after a time goal or raise money for charity to participate. whatever the challenge is, you have to have the belief that you can knock out the hurdles. a 16-weektraining plansounds super daunting at the beginning, but when you get through week one, you look back and you say, “okay, week one is done.” it gives you the motivation to think about knocking out week two. look at the plan like tiny checkboxes or dominoes."
"if you can knock out more of the dominoes and more of the checkboxes, then you’re going to figure it out. in conjunction with my training, i threw myself into some self-help books, including those by retired u.s. navy seal jocko willink who writes about discipline. it’s kind of bizarre to even think that i have gear for these things now! i invested in clothing that was meant for running and now my bottom dresser drawer is dedicated to only running stuff. →shockz openrun pro headphones: these are amazing. they’re waterproof and they allow you to hear the ambient noise around you so if you’re running outside, you can hear cars buzzing by you or people saying “on your left” when you’re on the bike trail. →nike vaporfly 3:i am anikeperson and i’ve gone through all of their pairs of shoes. i did my last two marathons in these, and i can’t recommend them more. i like the vaporflys because they fit really well and they’re even lighter than the alphaflys. →lululemon fast and free singlet:this tank top feels like you're wearing nothing. this is part of my super light kit racing gear. every runner has a story on the running interview the benefits of running for sobriety this duo ran 123 miles in 48 hours for charity minnesota’s governor loves running why this ultramarathoner loves long distances this former dancer now calls themself a runner he started running when he couldn’t go to the gym she plans to run on every continent she aims to make running more diverse she qualified for boston with pool running she started an all women running club motherhood changed how she approaches running a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"the 2018 boston champ used these mental strategies to defeat the distance. when desiree linden was at arizona state university, coach walt drenth asked every runner to write a race plan before each cross-country meet. linden continues the practice to this day. it appeals to her analytical nature, and she’ll vouch that it can help you break amarathondown into manageable sections. here are four more linden-approved tips for getting your mind ready to tackle 26.2. “thinking how bad you’re hurting with six miles to go allows you to feel sorry for yourself,” she says. “that gives you a reason to slow down.” instead, break down the race into segments, however small they have to be—the next sign, the next stoplight. for midpackers, linden advises challenging yourself, ""can you pass one person? can you pass five?"" [stay injury free on the road by getting on the mat withyoga for runners.] ask yourself, ""what am i supposed to do right now?"" her personal race plans always include: get out in a good spot; settle in; find your race pace; find your breathing pattern; make sure you get your fluids; drink early; drink often. when each is done, cross it off. then ask what’s next. stick to a set plan, and you’ll have less head space for self-doubt, she adds. linden is motivated by showing up for her team—her husband, coach, friends, agent. “i don’t want to let those people down,” she says. “i don’t want to get to the finish and be like, ‘well, i totally got soft after mile 22. sorry, guys.’ ” when you sign up for a marathon, you’re volunteering to find out, “how much hurt can i put myself through?” linden says. be proud of the answer. quick-wicking fabric and seamless construction ensure this bra will never chafe. $45 buy now newbies love its comfy cushioning, marathon vets pick it for pounding out high-mileage weeks, and road runners like its quick, smooth ride. $120 buy now drilayer burst fabric makes this comfy, lightweight top odor resistant. $35 buy now this soft, stretchy hoodie features thumbhole cuffs and a fitted hood to keep you toasty. $85 buy now this neutral trainer is the plushest pair brooks offers, and has delighted runners who just want a shoe that feels indulgent on their foot. $150 buy now wind- and water-resistant fabric over lightweight insulation keeps you warm and dry in the worst conditions. $160 buy now the high, slimming waistband includes two no-bounce pockets to carry your phone and keys. $80 buy now sarah lorge butler is a writer and editor living in eugene, oregon, and her stories about the sport, its trends, and fascinating individuals have appeared inrunner’s worldsince 2005. she is the author of two popular fitness books,run your butt off!andwalk your butt off! everything you need to know about hip pain how to increase mileage running periodized training can help you hit your goals marathon pace charts for fine-tuning training first boston marathon?"

"stumped on how to tell a gadget-obsessed runner you care? we’ve got you covered. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? looking for a useful,affordable,meaningful giftfor family and friends who run? our test zone experts are here to help. we thoroughly test and review hundreds of products each year so that we can recommend the best options for your unique needs. if the newest gadget is what therunner in your lifeis constantly pining for, these products might just help. apple refreshed its smartwatch to be faster and brighter, thanks to a new chip. it now tracks sleep and, since that means it needs to be recharged while you’re awake, the battery can be topped off in just 1.5 hours. though we find it’s always faster, often back to 100 percent by the time we get done showering and eating breakfast. apple is touting its new blood oxygen sensor, though it’s not really a running-fitness gauge so runners may not find as useful as more sedentary users. the bose sport earbuds are a leap forward from the first generation soundsport free. those older buds were enormous—sticking out of your head like the neck bolts on frankenstein’s monster. the new buds, however, barely protrude from your ears and are completely button-free (touch gestures play/pause and skip tracks, while tapping and holding activates a phone’s voice assistant). but they still have the great design that doesn’t completely seal your ear, blending excellent audio quality with a comfortable fit which eliminates the dreaded thump you get with each stride when wearing typical earbuds. this new smart watch is the closest competitor to an apple watch—basically like fitbit’s versa sports watch with extra sensors, which include an ecg, blood oxygen monitor, and a stress scanner (all features found on apple watch series 6). the sleek square-oval design affords plenty of real estate to read splits on the run. though we found the display doesn’t always light up when we raised our wrist and the touchscreen is somewhat unresponsive to exceptionally sweaty fingers. what makes it stand out from other smart watches: it offers all those sensors and around-the-clock health monitoring, yet the battery will go five days between charges. this butter bean-shaped massage gun is a breeze to hold and fits easily into a duffel bag for road trips. plus, since the battery lasts more than two hours, the charging cable need not come along for a weekend vacation. it has three speeds but doesn’t connect to a bluetooth-enabled app, so you don’t get the extra guidance that pricier options now offer. it comes with the standard ball head only, but you can order other tips like the cone for an extra $20. the forerunner 945 is the most feature-packed forerunnergps watchyet. it supports music playback and stores up to 1,000 songs, plus displays color maps so you can find your way around new cities without getting lost. this swedish brand is new to the u.s. and brings power unlike what we typically see in running headlamps."
"the trail speed 4xt has a spotlight that can compete with a car’s low beams. at its brightest, it cranks 1,200 lumens but, for actual usefulness, dial it back to extend run time all night. you need a big battery to power that torch, though, and silva smartly positioned it on the back of a thick headband—a top strap is required to stabilize the load. the overhauled pace gps watch is laser-focused on delivering the best, lightest, fastest run-tracking experience on the roads and during speedwork. it has just what a runner needs for training without a bunch of workout types and metrics they’re likely to never use. it tracks distance as accurately as any other watch we’ve tested and, at just 29 grams, is the lightest gps watch on the market right now. despite that, it still has a battery that will last up to 30 hours. hyperice and theragun both have bluetooth-enabled massage guns. so, too, does addaday, maker of therapy devices that cost a fraction of other options. regardless of the price, addaday doesn’t skimp on quality. this version of the biozoom connects to a smartphone app for guided recovery sessions. and the long, grippy handle makes it easier to get at hard-to-reach places. these affordable true wireless buds are packed with features found on top-tier pairs. they work with just about any voice assistant—tapping the left bud activates google or alexa; pressing and holding the right headphone prompts siri or bixby. and they feature an ambient aware mode, which allows the sound of vehicles and friends’ voices to come through without requiring yanking a bud. these are the safest headphones for runners who share the roads with cars. they use bone-conduction technology to send sound waves through cheekbones, without blocking ear canals. the newest model has a slim design that doesn’t vibrate annoyingly at loud volume and a richer, clearer sound than earlier versions. an ip67 rating means they’ll survive a heavy sweat or rainstorm. we love the enormous 22-inch touchscreen display and broad range of coaching options on this high-end machine. thetreadmilltaps into the ifit programming platform, where you can get guided video lessons from coaches like elite runner tommy rivers puzey or take scenic runs in exotic destinations around the globe. the vistas are among the smallest pairs oftotally wireless buds, with a tiny magnetic charging case, but pack a generous six hours of run time in a single charge. they’re also remarkably durable, completely sealed from moisture and dust. this full-length mirror is like a big shiny tv that streams a fitness instructor into a living room or home gym for strength training, yoga, and even stretch sessions. duringour testing, we liked that we could easily see how our form compared to that of the instructor. what sets the hyperice hypervolt apart from every other massage gun we’ve tried is its whisper-quiet operation. even at the highest setting, the hypervolt doesn’t intrude on conversations or detract from tv watching."
"like the addaday, this update includes bluetooth functionality, with a smartphone app for following along with recommended treatments. this 24-hour-a-day fitness tracker measures everything the wearer does when not running, monitoring their heart rate and movement all day and night. that data lets the app calculate how much strain their body has absorbed and generates a recovery score that’s easy to understand. most crucially, it’ll let them know whether they’re really ready for that hard workout or if they should take one more rest day. this little yellow sensor clips to the waistband of shorts—not shoe—and measures the vertical and side-to-side movement during a run. that means it can calculate key form indicators, like how much time the runner spends on each foot (favoring one side too much may lead to injury), and use the data to calculate running power in real time. pair it with a compatible garmin watch like the forerunner 945 or fenix 6 to get on-the-run access to stride data. the peloton tread is gorgeous and performs just as stunningly well—a massive 32-inch touchscreen displays live studio classes. the professional trainers, which are available through a live stream or pre-recorded workouts, make it hard to hold back on easy days. plus, the slatted running surface feels more realistic than most ’mills, and side-mounted dials make it a breeze to adjust pace or ramp angle. this update to the featherweight, foot-based power meter can now factor in the wind to determine how much energy you’re using during a workout or race. accelerometers and gyroscopes measure the path of your foot down to the millimeter to measure how many watts you’re putting out. we also appreciated the pod’s month-long battery and stryd’s powercenter website that tracks all our training. for $60 a year, you can purchase a one-year subscription to strava. the online training log renamed its paid offering (formerly summit) and has limited a lot of its previously free features to paying members, but there are a lot of reasons to upgrade: competing on segments, one of the more popular features, is limited to members. free users can see the top 10 on a leaderboard, but premium users can dig deeper and see where their friends and rivals stand, too. there’s also route planning, goal setting, and more complete analysis of workout data.

"there’s more to it than just getting the okay from your ob. there are a lot of milestones following the birth of a baby: coming home from the hospital, taking photos with the family, the first time theysleepthrough the night (hallelujah!). the milestones aren’t just for your new little one; the standard postpartum check-in with your ob-gyn, which generally happens around six to eight weeks after childbirth, is a turning point for moms too. during this visit, your doc will check your physical and emotionalrecoveryand will likely do a pelvic exam to ensure you’re healing properly (like making sure your uterus is shrinking back to its pre-pregnancy size). if all is good, they’ll clear you forsexandexercise. that’s a big deal for many new moms—especially if you’re arunneritching to get back to racking up the miles. but it doesn’t necessarily mean your body is back to its pre-baby ways and ready for action. when i eased intojogginga couple months after giving birth to my second son, myhip flexorswere super weak and achy. hoofing it up the neighborhoodhilli run up all the time felt like a totally new experience—and one that i was attempting with jell-o hips. the entire two miles i was out there on the road, i kept wondering,is this feeling normal? even though my ob said all clear… is thisactuallyokay? “each body goes through such unique challenges duringpregnancy, birth, and postpartum,” says susie crossland-dwyer, ultramarathoner, pilates instructor, and founder ofstudio sin cincinnati, who gave birth to her son in 2021 and did a lot of fine-tunedcross-trainingas she was easing back into her mileage. “getting a professional to evaluate your body and what it needs is crucial to returning to any type of movement practice.” to help you figure out whether you need a little extra tlc whenreturning to your running routine, even if your doc gave the go-ahead, we tapped experts to offer advice. they share how to tune into signs you’re ready for more movement, when to dial it back, plus a handful oftraining tipsto focus on so youcome back stronger than ever. clearance from your ob might seem momentous, but it’s really just the first step in your return to exercise if you want torun without any achesor pains. before you go run a few miles, you should check a few other boxes off as well: first, make sure you canwalkthe same distance you want to run with absolutely no problem, says andrea yarbrough, d.p.t., orthopedic and pelvic floor expert withthe hope doctorsin florida. it’s also a good sign if you have zero or very minimalsorenesspost-walk. from there, another good indicator that you’re ready to run is if you can do someinterval trainingcomfortably. we’re not necessarily talkingspeedwork, but rather alternate 1 minute walking with 30 seconds running and work up from there. and if you’re doingstrength trainingto support yourcardio—and doing it all pain-free—you can likely head out for a run knowing you’re prepared. still pee a little when you laugh or sneeze?"
"yes, that’s super-common when you’repregnant, but afterward, it can also be a warning sign that yourpelvic floor muscleshave been damaged or weakened and need some extra attention. other signs that these muscles need work include constipation, excess gas, or pain with sex, says yarbrough. and if you don’t address the pain orweaknessin thepelvic floorbefore demanding more of your body through exercise, chances are it will just compound the problem. “these issues usually don’t resolve on their own or with time, and i’ve seen them cause other issues within the body—even issues like tmj pain in the jaw,abnormal gait patterns, andpoor balance,” says yarbrough. apelvic floor physical therapistcan help you with these issues by doing a full-body assessment to pinpoint muscular weakness orimbalances, then putting together a plan withmassage,mobility drills, andstrength moves. other sneaky sensations to watch out for: core fatigue,back pain, and soreness or swelling around any scars (from a c-section or vaginal tearing). feel any of these and you should do somecross-trainingto support your miles—and maybe also just go easy on yourself. “anytime i felt these symptoms, i’d back off how many days i was running per week,cut a run short, or just give myself extra rest,” says crossland-dwyer. don’t worry: we’re not giving you extra homework to try to squeeze into your already-busy,sleep-deprivedschedule. some simple adds and tweaks to your routine are all it takes to make your mileage comfortable. yarbrough recommends focusing on things like deep breathing,single-leg balance, andglute strength. try these three techniques whenever you have a few minutes to spare. “this practice doesn’t have to take extra time out of your day and is very effective in re-establishing the right amount of intra-abdominal pressure,” says crossland-dwyer. “also, since thepelvic floorand diaphragm work together, healing happens in tandem.” to do it, place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, just below your ribs.breathein slowly, letting your belly rise as you inhale (your chest should remain still). then slowly let your belly collapse as you exhale. continue for five to 10 minutes. bonus: “this is such an easy tool to use inearly postpartumwhen life feels overwhelming,” says crossland-dwyer, who loved the technique forcalming her nervesso much, she continues to do it atbedtimenearly a year after giving birth to her son. add some moves like single-legglute bridgesandside planksinto your workouts, suggests yarbrough. these work deep-core muscles and improve yourstability, which will help keep you strong during the side-to-side motion of running. focusing on thesestrength-training exercisescan also help toinjury-proof your body, as they fightimbalances. this can help protect your muscles, joints, and ligaments as you add in more impact. crossland-dwyer says she couldn’t wait to get back torunning post-baby: “i wasn’t in a rush to berunning longorfastbut i missed the joy, the sweat, and the fatigue of a run.” but to start off, she committed towalkingfor 30 to 60 minutes daily to build back herendurancebefore adding in the impact of running. and then once she began running again, she continued taking frequent walk breaks to ease her body into it."

"herron also holds a volunteer role with usatf, and it is unclear if her position with the governing body of track and field is in jeopardy. this story will be updated. ultrarunner camille herron, who was shown in aseptember 23canadian runningreport to have allegedly made edits to the wikipedia pages of some of her competitors to downplay their accomplishments, has been dropped by lululemon, her primary sponsor. in a statement sent torunner’s world, lululemon wrote: “we are committed to upholding equitable competition in sport for all and intentionally partner with ambassadors who embody these same values. after careful consideration and conversation, we have decided to end our ambassador partnership with camille. we want to acknowledge camille’s achievements during our partnership and wish her well in her future endeavors.” herron, who did not respond to a text message fromrunner’s world, initially denied the accusations on the social media platform x, before deactivating her accounts on x and instagram. her instagram account has since been restored. the report bycanadian runningshowed how ip addresses linked to herron and her husband, conor holt, made changes to the pages forcourtney dauwalterand kilian jornet, among others. the report also said herron “altered the ultramarathon wikipedia page to remove references to danish ultrarunner stine rex’s48-hour and six-day world records.” rex ran thesix-day record earlier this month, breaking herron’s record from march. rex said in a september 23facebook post, translated from danish, that herron had accused her of cheating during her six-day record and “instead of talking about what achievement i had made, [i] had to defend myself to the danish and foreign media about why the world’s best female ultrarunner accused me of cheating. she took my joy of victory and made me doubt if i did something wrong.” holt wrotein an email posted to letsrunthat he took full responsibility for the edits to herron’s pages. the email did not explain why the pages of others were edited. holt did not respond to a text message fromrunner’s world. the couple is currently in greece so herron can compete at spartathlon, a 153-mile ultramarathon. additionally, herron is the secretary for the women’s long distance running committee of usa track & field (usatf). she is responsible for keeping the minutes of the meetings, a volunteer job that requires accuracy in reporting. a spokesperson for usatf said the organization has no comment at this time. it is unclear whether herron’s role with the organization going forward will change. the imbroglio has left much of the running community mystified. herron, 42, has accomplished incredible feats in ultrarunning and has gotten plenty of publicity for them, including coverage in thenew york timesandwashington postas well as running-specific publications. she owns the 48-hour record, which sheset in 2023 when she ran 270.5 milesaround a 400-meter track in bruce, australia. in march, herron ran 560.33 miles over six days infurther, a women’s-only ultra put on by lululemon. the six-day record, later broken by rex, was one of 13 records she set during the event. herron detailed on instagram the extreme toll that took on her body."
"philosopher and ultrarunner sabrina little, who is the author of the 2024 bookthe examined run: why good people make better runners, acknowledged the strangeness of herron and holt’s actions in an email torunner’s world. “we are all humans. humans make mistakes—sometimes even big, messy, unrepentant mistakes—and our community, myself included, could do a better job balancing justice and grace,” she wrote. “i know that it is difficult to do so on the internet, and it can be captivating to talk about these things and add our own perspectives. but i think we should leave room for a sanctioned person to be restored to the community, or to have some semblance of stability and continuity so they can move productively forward.” little added that she was not intending to diminish harms or to explain away the bad things that happened. “that would be a mistake,” she wrote. “the goal is not to lower standards. but one bad action (or pattern of bad actions) is not going to be solved with another bad action (gossip).” editor’s note: this story has been updated to remove des linden as one of the athletes whose wikipedia page was edited.althoughcanadian runningreported that linden’s page was edited, there is no evidence of that. sarah lorge butler is a writer and editor living in eugene, oregon, and her stories about the sport, its trends, and fascinating individuals have appeared inrunner’s worldsince 2005. she is the author of two popular fitness books,run your butt off!andwalk your butt off! parker valby signs with new balance nedd brockman runs 1,000 miles in 12 days after a tough year, kipchoge ponders what’s next trials champion nikki hiltz joins grand slam track dear god, don't run during a friggin' hurricane matthew centrowitz runs 2:24:36 at chicago susanna sullivan leads american women at chicago top american men at 2024 chicago marathon ruth chepngetich shatters world record at chicago john korir wins the men's race at chicago keira d’amato drops out of the chicago marathon results from the 2024 chicago marathon a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"fueled by 90-second “dirt naps” and the “la la land” soundtrack, she beat karel sabbe's record by 13 hours. minutes before midnight on saturday evening, tara dower emerged from the forest on springer mountain in blue ridge, georgia. trudging through the darkness, the 31-year-old wore a headlamp to navigate the last section of theappalachian trail—a beacon in the homestretch of a legendary journey. with thousands of miles behind her, dower fell to her knees and put her hands on the finish, a bronze plaque that reads, “a footpath for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness.” on september 21, dower became the fastest person in history to complete the appalachian trail, a 2,189-mile path that traverses maine, new hampshire, vermont, massachusetts, connecticut, new york, new jersey, maryland, pennsylvania, virginia, west virginia, north carolina, tennessee, and georgia. the professional ultrarunner, who lives and trains in virginia beach, virginia, covered the trail heading southbound in 40 days, 18 hours, and five minutes, the fastest known time (fkt), pending verification. she beat the previous overall record by 13 hours. prior to dower’s trek, the fastest known time was held bykarel sabbe. heading northbound, the belgian runner finished the trail in 41 days, 7 hours, and 38 minutes in 2018. dower’s performance also returns the fkt distinction to a woman for the first time since 2015, when scott jurekeclipsedjennifer pharr davis’ then-record by three hours, according tooutside. “this isn’t my fkt,” dower toldrunner’s worldon a phone call in between naps on monday morning. “it’s not just mine because without the crew, i would not have done it.” while navigating notoriously difficult sections on rocky terrain with a total vertical gain of 465,000 feet, dower ran and hiked an average of 54 miles each day with consistent support from her mom, debby komlo, and friend megan wilmarth, in addition to volunteers who paced her through different sections. her days began with a 3 a.m. alarm (usually from a tent close to the trail) followed by a quick breakfast. after tapingblistersand sores on her feet, she set off in the dark around 3:30 a.m. for the next 17 hours or so, dower only stopped for a couple of short breaks for meals, 90-second “dirt naps,” and pacers rotating in and out until 8:30-9:30 p.m. dower estimated she only ran solo for 20 percent of the time. when she did, she listened to audiobooks and movie soundtracks, likela la landandmoulin rouge, often singing to herself to stay awake. dower and her crew were so focused on time efficiency and staying close to the trail, she only took three showers throughout the entire thru-hike. instead, they relied on baby wipes, clean clothes, and friends to help detangle her hair. “there was a time when i was itching my skin and clumps of dirt and icy hot were under my nails. i was like, this is really gross,” she said. though she got off to a strong start, dower had to summon extra strength in the second half to match the pace set by sabbe."
"on the section of the trail that hits new jersey, dower and her crew realized she was falling behind by 100 miles or so and decided to increase her daily mileage from 43-54 to 55-60. in tough moments, wilmarth reminded her friend that she’s capable. “tara is really good at doing hard things, and that’s what i would tell her this whole time,” she said. in the last 129 miles, with the fkt well within reach, dower didn’t even stop to sleep. that last stretch proved to be the hardest physically and mentally. “i had this huge crew that was with me that was putting everything into this, their time and money, and bodies into this effort. i was nervous i would fall and mess it up,” dower said while describing how she bounced back from several tumbles on the trail. “i didn’t believe [the fkt] would happen until the last three miles.” to help distract her, dower asked her pacers to talk to her about anything other than the record. together, they shared stories of their favorite moments on the trip, including the breathtaking sunsets in virginia and wildlife they encountered. with one mile to go, dower went from feeling worried to grateful—for the crew who helped guide her and the experience of doing something unprecedented. “that last mile was pretty special,” wilmarth said. “you could just tell she was zoned in and focused.” for dower, the record also signifies redemption in many ways. seven years ago, she was eight days into her first thru-hike attempt on the appalachian trail when she suffered from a panic attack. a novice to long-distance hiking at the time, the former college rugby player was forced to end her hike early and confront her anxiety. in the years that followed, she worked on understanding the condition and found ways of coping with it. dower put more effort into building a community of friends on the trails. she also adjusted her perspective ongoal setting. instead of feeling overwhelmed with reaching the final destination, she started to set smaller benchmark goals that lead up to a big goal. two years later, dower returned with her husband and completed a thru-hike of the appalachian trail going northbound in five months and 10 days. “i really loved that experience,” she said. “i really felt like i was meant to hike the trail in 2019.” dower, who shares her ultra running and thru-hiking feats on her youtube channel, announced her fkt attempt in january. in ashort video, she said, “i’m all about the challenges. i always want to challenge myself … and number two, it just felt like i was being called to the trail again.” dower said learning from thru-hiking legends, including previous record-holder pharr davis, helped inspire her record attempt this summer. she also used the appalachian trail fkt as a fundraising opportunity for girls on the run, a nonprofit organization that hosts running programs for girls around the country."
"since taking off from the start at katahdin mountain in maine, she’sraised over $24,000far surpassing her goal of $20,000. (donations are still open.) in addition to the pacific crest trail and the continental divide trail, the appalachian trail is considered one of the “big 3” national scenic trails, according to thefastest known time website, the organization that tracks and verifies thru-hike attempts. the appalachian trail record is just the latest impressive result dower has achieved in a steady rise through the sport. since 2020, she’s completednine 100-mile racesandbroken five fkts. in august 2023, shecrushed the longstanding colorado trail women’s supported fkt, traversing the 567 miles from denver to durango in 8 days, 21 hours, and 59 minutes. in july, she finished fourth in the women’s field at the hardrock 100 one month before beginning her long journey across the east coast on august 12. less than 48 hours after achieving the appalachian trail fkt, dower said she hopes the team effort inspires women and girls, just as she was inspired by the women who broke barriers before her. “i hope more women get out there,” dower said. “it’s not about beating men, it’s about finding our true potential. and, you know, if you beat the men, that’s an extra bonus.” taylor dutch is a writer and editor living in austin, texas, and a former ncaa track athlete who specializes in fitness, wellness, and endurance sports coverage. her work has appeared in runner’s world, self, bicycling, outside, and podium runner. parker valby signs with new balance nedd brockman runs 1,000 miles in 12 days after a tough year, kipchoge ponders what’s next trials champion nikki hiltz joins grand slam track dear god, don't run during a friggin' hurricane matthew centrowitz runs 2:24:36 at chicago susanna sullivan leads american women at chicago top american men at 2024 chicago marathon ruth chepngetich shatters world record at chicago john korir wins the men's race at chicago keira d’amato drops out of the chicago marathon results from the 2024 chicago marathon a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"historic hut systems around the world are simple sanctuaries to stay overnight and extend your miles. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? ripples flowed across the surface of vista lake while the arms of pine trees danced in every direction. the helicopter’s high-pitched hum and rapidwhoomph-whoomph-whoomphof the rotors roared overhead as we landed. our crew of ninetrail runnerswas being heli-taxied to one of four off-grid huts speckling the esplanade range of british columbia’s selkirk mountains in canada. after the vista hut drop off, the pilot would shuttle our overnight bags to meadow and sunrise lodges, where we’d venture next. the four solar-powered shelters, owned bygolden alpine holidays (a tour company), are only 7 miles apart north-to-south, but require travel by foot up grassy slopes and rocky ridgelines between each one. and they also sit at nearly 7,000 feet above sea level. for the next five days, this remote region was home for me and those with me: 50,000 acres to explore via singletrack, rocky ridgelines, and sparkling turquoise tarns. we were excited to experience this special place with the added luxury of well-sheltered, well-fed overnights—plus wood-firedsauna sessions—all at the huts. i first learned about hut-to-hut trail running trips through word of mouth, specifically the annual summer hut-to-hut trip launched and led by professionalultrarunner rickey gates. growing up and living in the mountains of southwest colorado, historic huts have been a common sight onhikesi did with my family but only after hearing about gates’ trip did i realize they could be used fortrail running trips, too. later, i received a couple of invitations from trail runners to join hut trips, both catered and completely self-supported, opening up a new world of traveling through incredible terrain and locations. the trips sound dreamy just reading about, right? if you want to plan your own hut-to-hut running adventure (not all are only accessible by helicopter—many by foot), here’s how to make the most of your time in the backcountry. simply put, a hut-to-hut run trip means you stay overnight in a hut (or multiple huts) while “seeing a route, location or mountain range byrunning,” saysruncation travelfounder liz gill, a usatf-certified run coach and hut-to-hut running guide. founded in 2017, gill’s company provides guided and self-led itineraries, including trips through the dolomites of italy and slovenia and along the tour du mont blanc (in italy, switzerland, and france, spanning 106 miles in total). recently, gill also launched acamp-to-camp glamping run tripin machu picchu, peru. join runner's world+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runners hut-to-hut routes can be a point-to-point path or circuit of any distance with one or more overnight shelters. for tighter timelines, you could also run an out-and-back to a single hut (good if you want just one night in the backcountry). yourrun routeto, from, or around the huts may include segments of singletrack, pavement, doublewide dirt service roads, or no trail at all—just scrambling across boulder fields. generally, hut systems are accessible by foot or helicopter."
"however, some of the huts along particular routes, such as those along thetour du mont blanc, are located in villages or towns with road access. some hut systems, such as thehütten,as they’re known in the eastern alps, are nearly150 years oldwhile others, like a portion of colorado’s famed10th mountain division hut associationhut system, were builtin the 1950s, and a handful of bungalows offer more modern escapes. certain hut trips, like mine in the esplanade range, are basically located in the middle of nowhere while others link up villages. historically, huts around the world have served as shelters for soldiers, sheepherders, u.s. forest service patrol or other guards,ski mountaineers, and foot travelers, to name a few. today, many of these still-standing structures are available for recreational enjoyment. also known asrifugios,or mountain refuges, in italy,refugiosin argentina and spain, andgîtesin france, each one “can be quite different from another depending on the location and country. rifugios can have private rooms with three-course meals and others are a simple shelter,” says gill. with those simple shelters, you get a bed, perhaps kitchen utensils and books for leisure reading—and that’s about it. start by choosing an area of the country or abroad that you want to travel to, suggests gill, pointing tothe mountain hut book, one of her primary inspirations, in addition tothe tour of mont blanc. once you decide where you want to go, you can also research online to find a guidebook that details the huts in that place. commercialized huts will have contact info, overnight rates, and potentially reservation guidelines all online. as you research, also consider tracking down popular ski hut or hiking hut routes, because often those huts can not only be utilized for skiing and hiking but also be a good fit fortrail runningtrips in the summer months. next, “use a mapping service likefatmapandgaia gpsto plot a route, marking huts along the way. create a plan b and a bail out for if the conditions aren’t right. for instance, i’ve hit waytoo much snowto cross, had to go back and then go around a different way,” says gill. be sure to considerelevation gainand loss in addition todistance, so that you don’t bite off more ground than you feel comfortable. lately, huts are in growing demand for various adventurers, so book well in advance. “popular huts can often book out by november for the following summer. start early or look atoff-seasondates like late august or early september. there are plenty of lesser-known huts that are not along the most popularlong-distance trails, like the tour du mont blanc, that you can use for spur of the moment trips,” says gill. for example, colorado parks & wildlifestate foresthuts,maine huts & trailshut system, or the huts of theappalachian mountain clubin the northeast are all lesser known options. to learn more about hut systems in the united states,hut to hut usais a full-scope resource. as the book outlines, there are nearly sixteen hut systems across 14 states, mostly concentrated on the coasts. less trafficked, more primitive huts often have smaller fees or none at all."
"for instance, an undeveloped hut run trip i took with friends cost $10 total (one night for my food), because we didn’t need to pay for one of the huts where we stayed. other huts can cost over $100 per night, and require booking ahead. this cost varies depending on the country, travel season, provided amenities, and whether or not you coordinate with a travel guide, private backcountry chef, or hire a certifiedmountain running guide. if you do decide to hire a guide for your trip, check their certifications and experience. “it’s great to look for guides with certifications, which differs country to country, or at a minimum, extensive experience in the area. in some countries the certification is a ‘middle mountain’ guide that leads trails for running andhikingversus a high mountain guide, which is a more expensive service,” explains gill. for example, gill has wilderness first aid, sports first aid, and cpr certifications. at a high mountain guide level, james madden, co-owner ofcanadian rockies running adventures, which offers overnight run trips with huts and camps, is a double-certifiedifmgaandacmgmountain guide, alongside co-owner emily compton, an acmgapprentice hiking guide. how and what you pack is influenced by the type of hut you visit. “choosing staffed huts with a kitchen where the food and bedding is provided lends itself well to running, so that you can pack less and there are fewer logistics to organize regarding hiring a chef,” says gill. otherwise, “you could carry an ultralight stove and bring your food or hire someone to hike in the linens and food to cook for you,” says gill. some hut systems offer a package with extra services for groups, such as the guided and catered options.trail runnerscan also reach out to pack animal companies, outfitters, and backcountry chefs in their region of travel to inquire about the services and group packages they offer. minimalists or budgeted travelers carry all of their belongings in theirtrail running pack. “don’t skip on safety items, such as a satellite phone and a miniature first aid kit with essentials such as anti-histamines for insect bites and antiseptics to clean out scrapes from a fall. you can leave out creature comforts like multiple toiletry products. instead, use an all-in-one soap versus multiple products for the face, hair, and body. when you’re running, every pound makes a difference versus when you’rebackpacking, you might not feel each ounce as much. you want your pack as light as possible,” she says. gill’s pack necessities include a first aid kit, satellite phone or cell phone, and a map. in some locations, you’ll also want bear spray and bug repellent.sunglasses, a hat,sunscreenand chapstick with spf protection is key, as well as a water filtration system, whether you’re in the backcountry or running through towns. gill also carries arain jacket, wind layer such as thepatagonia houdini, lightweight puffy, change of underwear and socks, one extra t-shirt, leggings, toothpaste, a mini toothbrush, and phone or satellite device charger if electricity or solar-generated power is available."
"another option: hire a shuttle driver that transports your baggage to each hut by vehicle, pack animal, or helicopter—like my trip in the esplanade range—depending on the hut’s remoteness and accessibility. for primitive hut systems, friends and i have also backpacked our food and sleeping gear between remote mountain shacks, which each served as our basecamp for dailymountain runs. this women’s pack has two soft bladders and plenty of additional pockets and pouches. though it doesn’t come with bottles, this backpack can hold a water reservoir as well as extra gear you may need out on the trail. have easy access to all your essentials on long runs or races with nathan’s lightweight running vest. an affordable hydration vest complete with two soft flasks and other minimal storage needs. from exploration to solitude totime in nature, enjoying fitness,stress reliefandmeditation, laughs, or camaraderie on the trail, all of the aspects that most athletes love about trail running is amplified in-depth on back-to-back days. plus, running farther offers you an opportunity to see terrain you’d never otherwise experience: deep backcountry wilderness areas that typically can’t be accessed by road. as a result, these places are also more secluded and untouched. “when you’re running hut to hut over several days, you can see the ins and outs of the trail and of a place, especially along a mountain route that crosses through countries or along a border where you see the food, language, and culture change day to day, in addition to the scenery,” says gill. hut-to-hut run adventures can also be a fun way to connect with new or established friends ortrain for an endurance eventin addition to seeing new terrain. a handful of the most idyllic huts to consider visiting include california’ssierra club lodges and huts,clair tappaan lodge backcountry hutsin california, and the cabins and yurts of thealaska huts association, says gill. you could also add thesan juan hutsin southwest colorado, themaine huts & trailscollection, and thehutsof the appalachian mountain club in new hampshire to your list. also check out therendezvous hutsin washington, the yurts of idaho-basedsun valley mountain huts, or theboundary country trekkingyurt and bed and breakfast-style cabins in minnesota. internationally, “patagonia’s refugio circuits in el bolsón, bariloche, and el chaltén—which hand-make pizza or brew their own beer—are really fun and bedding is provided,” adds gill and says, “i have a personal preference for italian rifugios—they’re really amazing.” sometimes, it’s easier, less stressful, and safer—say, if you’re not experienced with remote navigation or risk management—to book a trip with arun travel companythat has a pre-dialed program, especially in an unfamiliar or international location. as mentioned, rickey gates offers thehut run hut, a six-day mountain running adventure along huts in colorado’s 10th mountain division hut association. my five-day esplanade range trip was organized byretreat goldenand included a backcountry chef, so i didn’t need to pre-plan my meals yet enjoyed flavorful, nutritious food. alternatively, you could stay posted at a single hut for a less complex trip."

"staying hydrated is a must on long runs. use these tips to make it simple to stash your h2o. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? in the last few weeks, temperatures have reached record highs across the country, which forced many of us to adjust torunning in the heat. one must-have to handling these high temperatures? stayinghydrated, which means running with a water bottle or other hydration gear. “most runners strategically pick theirclothes,sneakers, andtraining plans, but have no plan for staying hydrated,” says craig horswill, ph.d., clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the university of illinois at chicago, adding—no surprise here—that this is a problem. on the light end of the spectrum,dehydrationcan cause aheadacheand screw up your run, and on the severe side, it can lead toheat stroke, which can be deadly. we know carrying water in addition to everything else isn’t always ideal or the most comfortable, but it doesn’t have to be complicated and it can even make your runs better. here are three ways to comfortably run with a water bottle. some coaches argue that ahandheld bottlewill throw off your weight and thus your form. but two small handhelds (one in each hand for even weight distribution) makes for a smart option for shorterlong runs. “a simple handheld will do the trick for shorter runs less than two hours long,” says patrick caron, an ultrarunner who holds the record for fastest 100 miles run by a 19- and 20-year-old. “flasks are great because they’re there when you need them, and you can stash them when you don’t,” caron says. if you only want to run with one water bottle, pass it back and forth between hands each mile—it’ll prevent you from developingimbalancesand give you something to focus on as the miles tick by. if you prefer to stow your necessities on your waist, a lumbar pack (which sits around your hips) or belt can help you stay hydrated on both road andtrail. placing the weight of water on the small of your back, in the center, is the best place to distribute that weight without throwing offyour form. plus, packs have room to stow your fluids and otherfuelor gear you may need such asgels,snacks, orsunscreen. if bottles and belts aren’t your jam, try arunning vest, which is popular among trail andultrarunners. a vest works similar to abackpackin that it evenly distributes the weight on and around your core. running hydration vests are also super streamlined to stay close to the body, just be sure to test yours out on some shorter runs first to make sure there are no issues withchafing. determining yourhydration planis both complicated and simple. “everyone requires different amounts of water during their run,” horswill says. but it’s easy to figure out how much you need with one key strategy. first, weigh yourself nude rightbefore a run. next, run around your race pace for one hour, keeping track of how much you drink (in ounces) during the run."
"(if it’s during the summer, hopefully you’re drinking something!) after the run, strip down, towel off any sweat, and weigh yourself nude again. subtract your weight from your prerun weight and convert to ounces. (one pound equals 16 ounces.) then add to that number with however many ounces of liquid you consumed on your run. for example, if you lost a pound and drank 16 ounces of fluid, your total fluid loss is 32 fluid ounces. to determine how much you should be drinking about every 15 minutes, divide your hourly fluid loss by four (in the above example it would be 8 fluid ounces). because the test only determines your sweat losses for the environmental conditions you run in that day, you should retest on another day when conditions are different to see how your sweat rate is affected. you should also redo the test during different seasons, in different environments (such as higher or loweraltitudes), and as you becomefaster, as pace also affects yoursweat rate. horswill also warns againstover-hydrating, which can be fatal in extreme cases, so you shouldn’t weighmorethan your starting weight when you come back. do this test periodically throughout the year since your hydration needs will change based on the season and how well you’ve acclimated to the heat.

"in an excerpt fromup to speed, author christine yu examines what we know about female physiology—and why more science on sex differences in sport is so important. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? if there’s one person who fits the mold for a textbook endurance athlete, it might be ultrarunnercamille herron. you can’t miss her tall frame in races on the roads or thetrails. she’s usually at the front of the pack, her blond hair hanging loose around her shoulders. while her competitors may be grimacing, herron is most likely smiling. she just looks like she’s having fun—like there’s nothing she’d rather do than log mile after mile after mile. herron says she was born to run and her talent for long footraces has resulted in multiple american and world records, from 50-mile races to events that spanned 24 hours, world championship titles, and outright wins against all competitors. she even holds the guinness world record for thefastest marathonrun by a woman in a superhero costume (she dressed as spider-man). what makes herron so good atultrarunningis largely her physiology and, more specifically, her aerobic capacity. her body is primed for high-volume training. in grad school, hervo2maxwas measured in the high 60s, a level that indicates she has a pretty big aerobic engine. vo2max is a proxy for the maximum amount of oxygen you’re able to take up and pump to your muscles and is one of the three factors that does a pretty good job of predicting performance in endurance sports. while herron hasn’t had her muscles biopsied, she says she believes she’s made up of “probably like 99 percent slow-twitch”muscle fibers—the ones that power athletes through long, steady-state exercise and are less prone to muscular fatigue. unsurprisingly, the ability to withstand fatigue can be a pivotal factor in whether an athlete crosses the finish line. and women, on average, tend to have a greater distribution of slow-twitch, or type i, muscle fibers. on the whole, these fibers are suffused with capillaries, the tiny blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood. they have moremitochondriatoo, the cell’s energy powerhouse. that means slow-twitch fibers have everything they need to keep going and going…and going. men, on the other hand, have a greater proportion of fast-twitch or type ii fibers, which are better suited for speed and powerful bursts of movement, in part explaining men’s historic dominance in traditional sports. but with a lower concentration of capillaries and mitochondria, these muscle fibers also tucker out faster. sandra hunter, director of the athletic and human performance research center at marquette university, has spent the better part of the last 20 years studying muscle function in women and creating models to explain why muscles are susceptible tofatigue. in the lab, she has observed that women tire less quickly during specific kinds of exercise."
"for example, she asked women and men volunteers to perform intermittent, static muscle contractions—repeatedly engaging their arm muscles at 50 percent of their maximum strength for six seconds, then resting for four seconds, until they were exhausted. the men quit the steady-state activity after an average of 8.5 minutes while the women lasted approximately 23.5 minutes—nearly three times longer. hunter says the discrepancies aren’t due to a person’s motivation or ability to activate their muscles. instead, she says it comes down to the distinct composition of muscle fibers, and women have fibers that don’t fatigue as fast. but hunter says the greater muscle mass and muscle fiber diameter found in men might play a role too. when these stronger muscles are engaged, they might exert more pressure inside the muscle. the rise in internal pressure could restrict or cut off blood flow and oxygen, which would cause the muscle to tire quickly. other studies in the field have found that women accumulated less waste product and bloodlactatein their muscles, which may also contribute to their ability to withstand fatigue. while interesting, these findings don’t really tell us much about what might happen in the real world. in 2012, a team of canadian and french researchers set out to determine if women were still more resistant to fatigue after an actual ultra-endurance exercise session. they recruited 10 men and 10 women who were participating in theultra-trail du mont-blanc(utmb) in the alps, the super bowl of the ultrarunning world. after the 110-kilometer race (the normally 171-kilometer course was shortened due to wintery conditions), the muscles in the men’s calves and thighs were more exhausted compared to the women. the finding confirmed what hunter saw in her lab: women tire less than men after long, steady-state physical activity. aerobic capacity andmuscle enduranceare only part of the physiology puzzle. another key factor in an athlete’s success is how well their body usescarbohydratesandfatfor fuel. while carbohydrates are a readily available source of energy for most activities, the body simply can’t store enough carbs to keep an athlete going for extended periods of time. at some point, it must turn to fat to power working muscles, and the ability to burn fat efficiently matters in ultra-endurance sports. herron has a preternatural awareness of her body’s energy andhydration needs, rarely dipping into a depleted state where her body is using more energy than she’s taking in. while most people weigh less after a race because of the number of calories they expend and water weight lost through sweat, herron says she often weights the same, even after a 24-hour race. she’s never skipped her period either, a critical marker of hormonal and bone health linked toadequate nutrition. herron thinks it’s partly because her body is “probably wired for fat metabolism.” if an athlete is more adept at accessing and burning fat, their body may be better primed to sustain longer bouts ofaerobic exercisebecause, theoretically, they won’t run out of gas as quickly. fat, with its greater energy density, offers a bigger bang for the buck compared to carbohydrates."
"evidence suggests that women are more metabolically nimble, capable of switching from burning carbohydrates to burning fat, especially during the second half of themenstrual cycle. it turns out that women have more of a specific enzyme needed to facilitate the breakdown of long and medium fatty acid chains. compared to men, women break down and metabolize fat at a rate that’s up to 56 percent greater over a 24-hour period, regardless of physical activity level. even at submaximal efforts typical of endurance events, some research suggests that men use as much as 25 percent more of their stored carbohydrates. nicholas tiller, an exercise physiologist who studies how the body responds to extremeendurance exerciseand an ultramarathon runner himself, says this ability to utilize fat efficiently has “knock-on implications.” to keep moving forward, ultra-athletes must keep their bodies regularly topped off with calories. overall, women ultra-athletes don’t need to take in as many calories compared to men because of their smaller body mass. by not ingesting as much food, gels, bars, and sports drinks, women potentially dodge a bullet when it comes to meddlesomegastrointestinal issueslike cramping, vomiting,nausea, loose stools, and bloating, which are frequently cited as one of the top two reasons athletes drop out of a race or don’t perform as well as expected. plus, if an athlete utilizes fat for energy, like women seem to do, they can reduce the risk of glycogen depletion—when they’ve used up their critical stores of carbohydrates and hit the dreaded “wall.” both hunter and tiller caution that when it comes to sex-based differences in endurance sports, more research is needed. it’s an area of study that scientists continue to tease apart. while some studies show a definitive effect, others report no significant findings. in part, it’s because carrying out research on endurance sports, particularly with women athletes, is hard. for studies conducted in laboratories, scientists often default to men as participants due to factors like the complications (and costs) related to controlling for the menstrual cycle. with field studies, scientists have a hard time getting people to participate in general. “they’ve been training all year for one race. they don’t want to potentially compromise or sacrifice their race performance to help out someone who’s doing some research,” tiller says. lower participation rates of women in races make it even harder to recruit these athletes. with fewer (or no) women taking part in studies, scientists can’t examine direct sex differences. since ultra-races often take place on high-alpine trails, in desert landscapes, and on other difficult terrain, scientists must consider the event’s locations and logistics—and how that might affect data collection. if races occur in remote environments, it could be anywhere from an hour to a day or more for athletes to travel from the finish line to a lab. “at that point, there’s no point taking any measurements because any of the acute, short-term effects are going to have worn off. you need to take these measurements as close to the finish line as possible,” tiller says."
"in his studies, tiller has done everything from camping out in the field for 10 days to conducting tests with athletes in the back of a bus while traveling from the finish line back to base camp. he laughs as he describes what’s supposed to be high-level scientific research. it also influences the type of measurements scientists can collect in the field. it’s relatively easy to measure blood pressure andheart rate, take blood samples, and performbreathingtests. however, he says, these are superficial tests and “none of this is giving us a lot of information about how the body is responding” like ct scans might provide. while there are some compelling reasons for women’s success in ultra-endurance activities, researchers are still on the hunt for the x factor. as physiological advantages begin to fade away withlonger distances, athletes say the psychology of sports and mental stamina begins to take on more importance. it’s clear that endurance is far from straightforward. there is a complex array of factors, and at times it can feel like you’re shuffling a card deck, hoping you’re dealt a winning hand on race day. but what research and athletes themselves continue to discover is that a winning hand doesn’t look the same for women and men, especially for extreme distance events. those winning hands may include a wider, more varied combination of cards. in the case of women, they may even include cards from the discard pile that no one thought to consider before. when we start to expand the model of athletic performance beyond the traditional male framework, we add more cards to the deck, reframing what is possible for all people. fromup to speed: the groundbreaking science of women athletesby christine yu, published by riverhead books, an imprint of penguin publishing group, a division of penguin random house, llc. copyright © 2023 by christine yu. christine yu is an award-winning journalist and author of the book up to speed: the groundbreaking science of women athletes. her work focuses on the intersection of sports science and women athletes. she's a lifelong athlete who loves running, yoga, surfing, and skiing. your marathon packing checklist how to train for your first marathon benefits of zone 2 running why is it hard to wake up in the morning all about running tests for improved performance all about the maf method how to train like david roche training tweaks that will get you to a bq 5 april marathons for runners shut out of boston marathon workouts to get faster which fatigues first: your legs or your heart? how much racing is too much racing? a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"for hema lochan, running is an uphill climb that we’re all ascending together. every runner has their own unique mindset. in partnership withbrooks,runner’s worldis highlighting the different ways that running influences how we experience the world around us and view our place within it.below, nyc-based runner hema lochan shares how they view running as a mountain climb toward a beautiful summit worth sharing.wherever you want your mind to go—whether it’s a headspace, a feeling, or a finish line—let’s run there. hema lochan, a new york-based ultramarathon runner, running coach, and environmental-justice lawyer, sees every run as a mountain. you’re sweating, your calves ache, your heart pounds, and you might want to turn back…but you’re not alone. “if my running mindset were a physical place, it would be an uphill trail leading to a beautiful viewpoint on a mountain surrounded by all the folks i’ve met through running,” lochan says. “it isn’t always easy, and there are moments when i’ve wanted to give up on it. but in those moments i’ve relied on my running community to push me forward to reach the top of the climb.” first drawn to the sport for the community it provided, lochan now makes it their mission to foster inclusive running spaces for runners from all backgrounds withgame changers, an organization that, with support frombrooks, brings women of color together to become certified running coaches. and through this, lochan nurtures their own well-being and maintains the energy they need to take each step further up that mountain, one run at a time. “i think i fell in love with the community aspect of running before i fell in love with running itself,” lochan says. they recall wanting to be part of their high school cross-country team, but the idea of running more than 100 miles in a single race—an act that would later become a foundational part of their life as an ultramarathoner—seemed patently impossible. “the tryout was literally just to walk or run a mile. like, a singular mile,” they say with a laugh. “i couldn’t do it.” but even then lochan demonstrated the persistence they’d later come to rely on as an ultramarathon runner. “i got home and i emailed the cross-country coach,” they say. “i was like, ‘listen, if you take me on, i will be super-committed. i will come to every practice. i just really want to be part of the team.’” the coach gave them a chance, and eventually lochan fell in love with the sport of long-distance running. “along with being my connection to a community, running became my connection to my own body and story,” they say. by the time they were in college, lochan was frequently running marathons (they have now tallied 32 completed races to date). wanting to push themselves even further, they began signing up for ultra marathons. during one of their first ultras, they had an experience that altered their mindset about both runningandtheir career. this epiphanic moment occurred, as is so often the case, in the middle of a grueling race."
"“my ankles were killing me,” lochan says of their experience on that 2018 ultra, which spanned six days and 120 miles. they were alone, trekking up the steep slope of a mountain trail. “i just remember seeing the clearing ahead, and the viewpoint. once i got up, it was just me and the mountain, and i felt this beautiful sense of peace and gratitude.” in this meditative moment, lochan’s love for community was brought into focus—and directed toward action. “things connected,” they say. “i thought,wow, this makes me love running and love the trails, and makes me want to make sure that the trails are protected for a long time, so other people get to do this.” their realization on top of that mountain led them to specializing in environmental justice in their career as a lawyer, but that wasn’t all. they wanted to commit more deeply to the running community that they had cultivated through their daily runs by building and supporting inclusive spaces for runners. “i always associated running with feeling safe and feeling seen and being welcomed into a space, because i had that experience in high school, which was primarily people of color,” they say. “i never felt out of place on my team.” but in the years after high school, they began to realize that this wasn’t always the case. “i remember there were moments where i’d look around the starting line and see not a lot of diversity,” they say. “i could count the number of folks who were bipoc on my hand.” especially given the importance that community had taken on for them, they felt something had to change. seeking to embrace a leadership role, hema joinedgame changers, which mentors potential coaches from bipoc communities and provides funding for the coaching certification process. in 2022, lochan became a coach themselves—a transformative moment on their running journey. “now that i’m leading and organizing runs, my mindset is about checking in on everyone else,” lochan says. “whether i’m leading trail runs or teaching fundamentals of running, making sure everyone feels welcome in this space is always my center.” they glow as they discuss not only their own achievements, but the feeling of shared success in showing others that there’s an inclusive community where they can run and feel supported. “that’s what remains beautiful to me, even when i can’t pull myself out of my negative thoughts. i remember what this person got through or that person got through through running. and that reminds me that i can get through today,” they say—another step up the mountain."

"you’ll be ripping over rocks and mud like a mountain goat in no time. getting off the road is a great way for any runner to deepen their love of the sport. but taking that first step to the trails can be an intimidating prospect to those who are used to strictly running on roads or paved trails. trail running doesn’t have to mean bushwhacking your way to a mountain summit, though. “people don’t realize how accessible trails are,” says adaptive athlete andmerrellambassadordan kosick. “a trail can be the gravel path at the park down the road, just three steps off the sidewalk, or a more secluded, wilderness route.” and those trails come with benefits: softer terrain that’s more forgiving on the joints than roads, varying surfaces that force you to change speeds and activate different muscle areas, and space to let the mind wander. learn more about trail running “spending time in nature, engaging my body in movement that connects me with the earth, and doing the thing that makes me feel most human can be really life-altering and affirming,” saysmirna valerio, an ultrarunner, cross-country coach, and merrell ambassador. “that is what brings me back to trails, every time.” we asked kosick and valerio for their advice to runners who want to confidently and safely start running on trails. invest in trail shoes kosick advises against simply wearing your road running shoes on technical trails—at least shoes designed for going fast on pavement, with very thin tread. “if you have insufficient traction or protection for your feet, that’s going to make it 10 times harder and create a miserable experience,” he says. look for a pair that will work for most of the terrain you plan to hit: some road shoes will work fine on buffed trails and fire roads. for trails with rocks and roots, you’ll need a little more heft. shoes for those runs should be comfortable, protect your feet from rocks and other hazards, and have grippy lugs to grab rocks and dirt and help you stay upright in sloppy conditions. choose a waterproof pair if you plan to run somewhere that’s typically wet or muddy. roads are convenient: lace up, walk out the door, go. trails require more planning, particularly if you expect to be away from home longer than a typical road run. check the hourly weather before you leave the house so you don’t get caught unprepared in a hail storm less than half a mile from home, like valerio once did. regarding preparation, valerio’s other advice is to research and map your route in advance using an app like alltrails. “is it a technical trail? will it be muddy? will there be scree [loose rocks on the mountainside]?” those things will affect how you gear up, valerio says. lastly, tell someone your route and your expected return time—if they don’t hear from you, they’ll know when to alert someone and where to send them. in general, you want to opt for smart, technical layers."
"a waterproof rain jacket, wind shell, or thermal layer will become staples. for colder weather, wear something like a light vest with some storage space in it. “on a mountain, weather can change at less than a moment’s notice,” says valerio. not having the right gear can be uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst. “a lot of people don’t realize how hard they’re working, even when they’re just power hiking up a hill, and then they overheat because they don’t have a plan to shed layers,” says kosick. you should never have that problem—nowadays, you can get outerwear that weighs mere ounces and folds up smaller than a water bottle. if you plan to climb a lot of hills and mountains, it might be a smart idea to invest in some trekking poles specific to trail running. “on a long run, they can help with leg fatigue by sharing the effort throughout your upper body,” says valerio. heading out of civilization? always bring food and water, says valerio—even if you’re planning on a shorter run. you’ll be thankful for them if you get lost or your route turns out to be longer than anticipated. and unless you’re absolutely sure you won’t be out past dark, bring a headlamp, she adds. some road runners prefer to leave their phone at home, but on a trail, it can be your lifeline. if you’re taking an unfamiliar route, make sure to have the map downloaded before you lose service. all of these items are going to make your trail run a less stressful, more enjoyable experience. this can be tough for road-to-trail transitioners to grasp, but slowing down is okay! on the road, if you want to up the intensity, you push the pace. but on the trails, every run has an inherent intensity—engaging small stabilizer muscles as you steady yourself on undulating terrain, squeezing those glutes on steep uphills, and trashing your quads on those rollercoaster-like downhills. plus, there are more potential obstacles. you kind of have to slow down for a fallen tree or family of deer in your path. so don’t beat yourself up if you have to walk uphill, or judge your performance negatively because your trail run paces are slower than on the roads. they are completely different forms of running. no looking up the road for the next checkpoint here. on trails, you should fix your gaze three to four feet ahead so you can react to whatever rocks and roots come at you. be ready to skip, weave, and move in different directions without warning to dodge those obstructions, valerio says. think light on your feet, like a ballerina. “the more hesitant or tight you are because you’re afraid of tripping, the more likely that is to happen."
"the more confident and loose you can be, the easier you’ll flow over the terrain and when youdotrip (it’s inevitable), you’ll recover easier.” the unpredictable nature of trails also makes them a great place to get in tune with your form.“i like to lean into the hill as i ascend,” says valerio. “when you’re extra tired, aid your legs by pressing down on your thighs as you head uphill.” there will be dirt and mud. there will be puddles and streams. so splash! “have fun with it and laugh it off, it’s part of the ride,” says kosick. “i’ve walked on all fours like a gorilla or crawled over many slippery areas, and i use trees and rocks to grab onto or pull myself forward.” he recommends wearing a pair of light gloves so you’re not afraid to get a little sap on your hands or grab a wet or dirty rock. “knowing you have that little bit of protection will help you loosen up and build your confidence so you can enjoy yourself instead of holding yourself back.” fuel with what you want to eat a guide to trail running for beginners trail running tips for beginners and experts how to make running with a water bottle easier save on frontline plus products at amazon now how to run with poles how a champion preps for a day of trail running how to plan a hut-to-hut running adventure the 30 best gifts for hikers in 2022 winter trail running safety tips 10 best hiking pants for comfort on every trail the best hiking apps for trail runners a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"think you have no time, are too old, or running is too hard? forget those narratives and start a run routine today. sure, there are legitimate reasons for occasionally skipping a workout ortaking time off(we’re not here to argue with your doctor or your body, for that matter). but most of what you’re telling yourself about why you can’t start or maintain a regularrunning routinecan often be easily debunked. we spoke with a handful of coaches and experts to get their take on some of the most common reasons runnersbail on their training. they shared insight on what’sreallyholding folks back and offered solutions for experienced runners who have fallen off track, as well asbeginnerswho are hesitant to get started. so prepare to be (gently) called out. then, put on your shoes and go for that run. time is a limited resource, and it can be tough to squeeze in a run when a demanding job, family responsibilities, and social obligations are all competing for your attention and energy. but if you’re waiting for things to “calm down” before you commit to a consistent running routine, you may be waiting forever. instead, try adjusting your expectations. “ditch thelong workoutsand embrace shorter efforts,” suggests alison staples, a coach at&runningin howard county, maryland. “studiesshow even 20- or 30-minute runs have mental and physicalbenefitsthat outweigh skipping the run altogether,” she says. plus,prioritizing runningmay help you feel better equipped to manage thestressand chaos of everyday life. “running allows you to disconnect from a busy workday or what’s going on in your personal life,” says raj hathiramani, a certified running coach atmile high run clubin new york city. “you may also feel a bit more productive and more energized.” just make sure to treat your dedicated running time—whether it’s 15 minutes or two hours—the same way you would any other important meeting or appointment. put it on your calendar, plan accordingly, and keep your commitment. gearwill make or break your cold-weather running experience. “dress using layers, and as youwarm upon your run, you can peel them back,” advises coach gemma ward,new york road runner’srunner training and products specialist. “you can also wear accessories [like thickerglovesand ahatthat covers your ears], which will help keep your hands and head warm,” she says. just be sure to choose items made with wind-resistant and sweat-wicking fabric. (nothing will chill you faster than a soggy cotton t-shirt.) ward also recommends starting yourwarmupinside. “do some high knees, butt kicks, quick feet, and star jumps to help get that blood flowing and help you get warmed up before you head out into the elements,” she says. continuing your warmup outside with a focus onproper breathing mechanicswill allow your body to acclimate to the cold and avoid that “lungs on fire” feeling. “really trying to activate yourdiaphragm, taking those deeper breaths, and doing a more gradualdynamic warmupinside and outside can help you adjust,” hathirmani says. all bundled up andstillcan’t bring yourself to step out into the tundra? remind yourself of thebenefits of running in the cold."
"“you need to be a little bit more mentally resilient to brace for the cold and run outside. every time you do something that might be more mentally challenging, you’re training your mind to overcome those types of barriers. so it’ll be a lot easier next time or when you have other types ofmental barriers,” hathiramani says. the promise of a treat—like a toasty bagel or a cup of hot cocoa—can help, too. “just thinking about that postrun reward can help you get through the cold,” hathiramani says. if you’re getting adequatesleep, takingrest days, and still feeling drained, you may be running too fast.todd buckingham,ph.d., triathlete, coach, and professor of movement science at grand valley state university in allendale, michigan, often sees this issue among athletes dealing with performanceplateaus,fatigue, repeat injuries, and illnesses. “if you’re running too much or too fast, your body doesn’t recover. [and because you’re not recovered] you’re not running hard enough to get thebenefits of hard running, but you’re also not running slow enough to get thebenefits of slow running,” he says. buckingham recommends keeping 70 to 80 percent of your training in zones one and two, which should feel easy. (he notes that you don’t have to save all your hard running for one day; most of his workouts intersperse hard efforts, likestrides, into slower-paced runs.) one way to determine yourideal “easy” paceis to take your threshold pace—something you could sustain for about an hour—and add 60 to 90 seconds per minute. or go by a simpletalk test: you should be able to hold a conversation duringeasy-effort runs. if you’renew to runningor arereturning to the sportafter a break, you can expect to feel a little sore and achy. “like anything, we need to develop a tolerance for prolonged movement,” sayscolleen brough, d.p.t., assistant professor of rehabilitation and regenerative medicine at columbia university irving medical center in new york city and director ofcolumbia runlab. following a gradually progressivetraining planand prioritizingrecoverycan help beginners minimize discomfort andavoid injury. for more experienced runners, chronicsoreness(not just feeling a little stiff after a tougher-than-usual workout) could be a symptom ofovertraining,dehydration, or inadequate rest and recovery. and if you’re dealing with ongoing pain or recurring injuries, there could be a bigger (but often fixable) problem. “[running] form may be a driver of persistent injury,” brough adds. a well-trained coach may be able to identify and resolve the issue, or you may need to seek out aphysical therapistwho specializes in running for a more in-depth analysis. bottom line: some soreness is normal, but running shouldn’t hurt. so seek professional help if it does. vacations, family holidays, and work trips will inevitably disrupt your normal routine. but stepping away from your typical schedules androutescan actually enhance the running experience, as long as you approach your workouts with an open mind and a sense of adventure. “some of my favorite runs have been while i am on vacation,” ward says. “there is something magical about seeing a new city early in the morning before everyone else wakes up."
"you can check off some of the popular tourist locations before they become too crowded.” of course, you need to plan accordingly; pack weather-appropriate gear and research safe running routes in advance. and make sure you know how to get back to where you’re staying in case you find yourself without an internet connection. “you could also look to see if there is a localrunning clubyou could join, which will help take the planning out of where to run. that’s also a way to find local hotspots,” ward adds. also, if a scenic run isn’t in the cards—maybe you’re short on time, low onenergy, or stuck in the middle of nowhere—there’s nothing wrong with hopping on thetreadmillin the hotel gym (or family’s basement) for 20 minutes and calling it a day. you’ll still gain benefits and keep your routine consistent. “you are still a runnereven if you walk,” hathiramani says. “runners, from beginners to professionals and everything in between, incorporate arun/walk strategyfor different reasons, whether they are building theirendurance, returning from or mitigating an injury, training for anultramarathon, reducingfatigue, or simply making running more enjoyable,” he says. so, if you’re running and walking, keep going. if you want to apply a more structured approach to your training, hathiramani recommends alternating between one minute of running and two minutes of walking. over time, you can increase the duration of your runs or switch up the ratio so you’re alternating between a minute of running and a minute of walking or two minutes of running and one minute of walking. most runners will get stuck in a rut from time to time. “you find yourself running the same loop, same weekly mileage, same intensity runs every single time you lace up. you’re bored and don’t really seeprogress,” staples says. you don’t have to ditch running altogether to get unstuck. you just have to change something about the way you’re running, she says. “find a new route. try newworkouts. hire a coach. join a run club. if you’re used to runningmarathons, sign up for a5k,” she says. to help keep yourself accountable, consider scheduling a weekly run with a buddy or joining a gym. “that can motivate you because you’re thinking, ‘i paid money to use this service, so i better go use the service. otherwise, i’m just losing money every month,’” buckingham says. you may also find that watching a tv show while you run on thetreadmillor having access to health club amenities makes sticking to your running routine more enjoyable. for months, you’ve beentraining for the big race. now that it’s over, running seems unappealing and a little pointless. after all, you’re not trainingforanything. “this is when you shouldtake a break. there is nothing wrong with taking a few weeks or even a month or two off if you need it,” staples says. “as much as we as runners would love to plow through week after week of hard training, our bodies and minds just aren’t built that way."
"a break is necessary for longevity.” use your time off to think about your reasons for running that have nothing to do with competitions or events. “i definitely encourage people to disconnect from always working toward something and running for enjoyment. for more than just adistance goal or a time goal. [it’s important] to truly understand why you run, whether it’s yourmeditation, your chance to disconnect, or whether it’s a chance for you to do somethingchallenging,” hathiramani says. otherwise, you may find yourself in a never ending cycle of training, events, and burnout. once you’re ready tostart running again, try exploring a new aspect of the sport. “maybe you switch from road racing totrail racing, or from a longer distance to a shorter distance. or you do something more social, like joining arunning groupor a running club,” hathiramani says. if you have a body and the ability to run, you have arunner’s body. “when it comes to recreational running, everyone has a runner’s body,” brough says. “building running volume comes not from our physique, thinness, or height, but by improving cardiovascular endurance,muscular endurance, and mental resilience. all of these elements make a great runner, and each is changeable with time and practice.” need some inspiration from other runners who felt the same? read whatstephanie jackhas to say about embracing the runner identity, and findtips for cultivating a sense of belonging. there’s no official age limit for running. (just look at the results for the2023 new york city marathon—more than 440 finishers were between the ages of 70 and 89.) in fact, running may helpseniorspreserve their health, brough says. “even as we age, endurance exercise continues to help keep blood pressure andresting heart rateslower and maintain cardiac output and heart strength,” she says. that said, seniors should absolutely have clearance to run from their medical doctor “to be sure there aren’t any underlying cardiac concerns,” brough says. older runners should also prioritizerecoveryand incorporatestrength traininginto their fitness routine. “fast-twitch muscle fibersdecline rapidly as we age, so a goodstrength-training programwill help mitigate this,” brough says. tips to make consistent fitness progress benefits of zone 2 running how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week? avoid going out too fast in a race how to run slower on easy days all about running tests for improved performance all about the maf method it’s time to rethink mileage vs intensity how to run with knee arthritis and reduce the pain all about heart rate training stop worrying about pace so much in workouts a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"when gels and chews aren't appetizing, use these alternatives to get the calories you need. as an ultrarunner, i’m all too familiar with the saying that long-distance running is an “eating contest with a running component.” i constantly experiment withgels, gummies, drink mixes, andbars, trying to figure out how to get the calories and carbs i need to get through hundreds of miles. being able totake in fuelis easily the biggest factor that can make or break a race. over the past 10 years, i think i’ve gotten things pretty dialed in. i’ve discovered gels from the brand enervit that go down easy, sit well in my stomach, and helped me breeze through my spring 100-miler in fifth place. but fueling isn’t always so simple. some days, my stomach wakes up more sensitive, and i can’t convince myself to throw back gel after gel. other days, i run so long i get tired of the fuel i’ve been using and just need to switch things up. so here are some of the race-tested alternatives to gels i’ve found success with that you can try on your runs. so many fuel options are based on carbs and sweet flavors, but sometimes i simply crave something salty. potato chips and pretzels can help replace electrolytes lost in sweat. a small bag of potato chips can provide 170mg of sodium and 350mg of potassium, rivaling electrolyte capsules. they go down easily with water, practically dissolving while taking sips. the breadiness of these can also help absorb acid in my stomach and settle things when i experience some sloshing. on long ultras where there are hours between aid stations, and the weight of everything i have to carry becomes more of a factor, i like to take a snack-size ziploc bag of calorie-dense cashews. a relatively small package easily puts about 600 to 800 calories in my pocket. when i’m spending all day on the trail, it also helps to have food like this that makes it feel like i’m eating a real meal from time to time. it’s a great option for something that goes down easily. i go with gogo squeez applesauce. they have a few different flavors; apple cinnamon and apple strawberry are my favorites. a bit lower in calories than gels, at 70 per packet, they are better used as a supplement, not a main source of fuel. for faster efforts like a 90-minute training run, or racing a half marathon, i find it more difficult to take in gels. i want my fuel to go down as quickly as possible, so i’ll opt for a high-calorie drink mix, like tailwind, to consume the carbs i need with as little effort as possible. a standard 500ml soft flask provides 200 calories, similar to what i get from two gels. how to strength train for a 5k 20-minute workouts for when you're short on time the shoe behind the women’s marathon record how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week?"

"adding walk breaks to your training runs and races just might provide your ticket to faster finishes or longer distances. many runners have a few dirty little secrets, like not quite making it to thebathroomorchafingin unmentionable spots. but one thing many runners also won’t admit to... walking. that is, unless you embrace the run/walk method, which involves adding precisely planned walk intervals to your runs. the run/walk method can offer runners many benefits, including helping tofight off fatigue. it can even help you clock faster finish times and maybe even win a race that you thought was out of reach. just look to marc burget for evidence. aultramarathonrun/walker, burget, 50, won the 2016 daytona 100 (miles) in 14 hours and 14 minutes which, at the time, was a course record. “the idea that you should move from walking to running is the wrong framework,” burget, director of operations at bailey’s health and fitness in jacksonville, florida tellsrunner’s world. “instead, putting walks in myrace plansallows me to go the whole 100 miles without becoming tired.” research supports burget’s experience. according to a 2016 study published in thejournal of science and medicine in sports, of the 42 runners studied, those who used the run/walk method in a marathon reported less muscle pain andfatigueand finished with similar times, compared to those who only ran. so, while it’s true that runners typically move faster than walkers, it’s also true that during long races ortraining runs, taking well-timed walk breaks can help you reach your goals. to understand the run/walk method, here are common myths and truths about the training and racing strategy, plus how to test out the system for yourself. in recent years, more runners and experts have learned thatzone 2 running(that is, lower effort runs), improves many elements of fitness and supports your ability to run both long- and short-distance races withoutfatiguingas quickly. whatever distance you race, it’s important to manage yourenergy levelsfrom the start, so you can make it to the finish withoutbonking. while fuel plays a role in maintaining energy,how you pace a raceis also crucial. “there’s a myth that a lot of runners perpetuate about banking time,” chris twiggs, chief training officer at galloway training programs tellsrunner’s world. “the time bank doesn’t exist. the bank that does exist is the bank ofenergy. when you walk during your run, you are investing in the bank of energy.” burget agrees. the first time he ran 100 miles, he planned to run the whole way, but because of exhaustion, he ended up walking about 20 miles. once he started to train with the run/walk method, he cut his walking down to 10 to 15 miles thanks to 30-second walk intervals. now, with experience, most of his ultras include eight to 10 miles of walking and he either alternates three minutes of running and 30 seconds of walking, or 0.3 miles of running and 30 seconds of walking, depending on his race strategy and goals. if you have your mind on apr, the run/walk method could help you get there. you just have to practice."
"“your walk should be brisk, but not work,” says burget. “you want yourheart rateto drop down.” you also want to give your muscles a break from the intense effort to allow for a midrun recovery. because you’re walking, you also need to make your runintervalsfaster than if you’re going for a steady-state run. for example, let’s say you want to average an 8-minute per mile pace for a marathon. try running a 7:40 pace for nine-tenths of a mile, then walk for 30 seconds, so that you finish a mile in eight minutes. “you’re not losing 30 seconds,” burget explains. “you’re moving forward, but part of your pace is a walk.” likewise, if you want to maintain an 11-minutepace, you could do a 40-second walk every three minutes of running at around a 10:20 pace per mile. if you have been running for a bit but you don’t know where to start with your interval ratios and paces, do a “magic mile” run, both experts say. this will help set your goal pace for a race. with that magic mile time in mind, set your interval ratios, keeping in mind that generally, the faster your average pace, the longer your run intervals. for example, if you’re aiming for an 8-minute mile average pace, you may run three minutes and walk 30 seconds. but if you’re aiming for a 10-minute mile average pace, you may run 90 seconds and walk 30 seconds. if you’re a beginner, twiggs suggests starting your workouts by running for 30 seconds and walking for 30 seconds. if that seems too easy or you can feel yourself wanting to run more keep the 30-second walk, but run slightly longer between walks, he says. you can keep track of your ratio usingtime or distance. twiggs uses time, while burget often pays attention to the mile markers in his races, walking for the last tenth of each mile. play around with what works best for you. “it took me a few months to figure out the ratio that works for me,” says burget, who has also run a 2:50 marathon by alternating six-minute runs and 15-second walks. when you want to actuallyincrease your average paceper mile, do another magic mile to see how much faster you can go, and then either increase the speed of your run intervals, add more time to the run intervals, or cut down on the time of your walk breaks. while there are no statistics on how many runners use walks in theirtrainingor in their races, how long they’ve been running, or how “tired” any runner is when they walk, we can confidently say that runners who strive to incorporate walks into their runs are all ages and all levels of fitness. both burget and twiggs run ultras, something less than1 percent of americansdid in 2023, and ultrarunners typically aren’t new to the running game. in fact, planning your run/walk strategy for races can take practice so many experienced runners and walkers may turn to it."
"for example, burget has learned to time his walks to match the location ofhydrationstops and elevation gain in his ultras so he can maximize his running potential. but that came with lots of practice using the run/walk method. always study the details of your upcoming race and consider creating a strategy to match walks with water stations and hills. “looking at the landscape when planning your run/walk is important,” says burget. “walking hillsis smart because we want to do what we can to conserve our energy so that when we expend our energy we get the most bang for our buck,” says twiggs. running up hillsduring training will help you build leg strength, but in a race it could decrease your pace (and finish time) because it takes so much effort, adds twiggs. without planning, you might find yourself running up a hill (wasted effort) and then walking a descent as you recover. planning ahead can help you flip that to maximize your energy and increase your speed. the point: go into your race with a clear plan that has specifically planned walk breaks so you’re not just slowing it down when you feel like it, which could be a detriment to performance, twiggs explains. playing around with your run/walk ratios during training will also help you set this in stone come race day. the reason running is defined as “high” intensity while walking is considered “low to moderate” intensity is because it takesmore energyto run than to walk. typically, your heart beats more frequently when you run than when you walk in order for your body to produce that extra effort. break up those runs with walks, though, and you are giving your heart, muscles, bones, and joints a break. it’s helps with the deposit into your energy bank, as twiggs says. the benefit of those deposits? you may be able to add to yourrace schedule, say by running ahalf marathoninstead of a 10k, if that has seemed out of reach. if you think you can’t run amarathon, could you run/walk one? to prove the point that adding walks intolong runscan cut down on fatigue and help you go longer (or even run more frequently), take another example from burget: in 2023, he ran seven marathons in seven consecutive days, aiming for a sub-three-hour finish for each race. while he ran just over three hours in two of the races, his other times ranged from 2:52:15 to 2:58:57. “i used the same interval for each race,” burget says, “a 20-second walk during each mile.” while you experiment with run/walk intervals, try to notice how you feel in comparison to runs that don’t include walks. do you feel like you can increase your typical run distance or duration by a half-mile or 10 minutes? to progress tolonger distances, you have a variety of options: you can increase the pace of your runs or shorten the walk breaks you take, says twiggs, while still running for the same overall amount of time. (this will increase your average pace.)"
"or you can maintain your pace and your ratio, but add more rounds of intervals, so you run for a longer duration and therefore, distance, which may come easier than only running because of the added recovery element. do what feels best for you. in addition to helping you conquer longer distances, the run/walk method might increase your race options by also allowing you to take part in multi-day events, such asrundisney weekendsor philadelphia’s marathon weekend, which includes an 8k, half, and marathon. while some runners, of course, take part in these events without using the run/walk method, “we’ve seen anecdotally that for millions of runners, this allows them to run races they would not have otherwise considered,” says twiggs, because it can allow for that quickerrecovery. donna raskin has had a long career as a health and fitness writer and editor of books and magazine articles. she bikes in a nearby county park, lifts weights, takes zumba, and loves to walk/run with her dog, dolly. how to strength train for a 5k best half marathon workouts why it’s important to avoid running through injury why—and how—you should run doubles 20-minute workouts for when you're short on time benefits of zone 2 running how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week? every runner has a story on the running interview why is it hard to wake up in the morning 10 races you've never heard of run better with the 5 components of fitness a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."

"my fiancé, jeremy, and i brainstormed a social media framework for the running interview show and crafted my go-to pick up-line: “hey, how many miles are you running today?” i got after it and started myrunning interview tiktokin april 2023. to get the show off the ground, i initially approached strangers on the street, offering them a pair of shoes to join me for a run and share their stories. this grassroots approach was a bit of a financial strain, and i even went into debt in the early stages to support it. i was working a job at an advertising agency, and let’s just say that my salary was definitely not supporting my need to buy and give away more than 20 pairs of sneakers a month. i would film episodes every day before heading to my day job, which meant balancing a tight schedule and financial strain. despite these hurdles, it’s been incredibly rewarding to see how running fosters genuine connections and meaningful dialogues with a diverse range of guests. i run with guests almost every day. after the runs, we sit down while we’re still buzzing for my new podcast,post run high. the new show allows us to dive even deeper into the conversations we started during our runs. in my free time, i’ve also leaned intopilates and yogato complement my running routine and support overall flexibility and strength. i’m looking forward to continuing to explore newrunning routeswith different guests and further integratingcross-trainingpractices into my routine. it’s an exciting balance of maintaining endurance while enhancing my overall fitness. i want other runners to know that my journey hasn’t been a straight line—it’s been filled with ups and downs,injuries, and detours. but through it all, running has been a constant source of joy and self-discovery. my advice to those looking tostart runningis simple: just start. don’t worry about your pace or distance at first. find joy in the movement, listen to your body, and remember that every step you take is a step forward. running is a personal journey, and there’s no right or wrong way to do it. trusting your body and knowing when to push or rest is key to staying injury-free andenjoying runninglong-term. it’s important to be mindful and adapt your training based on how you feel. regular practice, even when motivation is low,builds enduranceand strengthens the mind-body connection. small, consistent efforts lead to big gains over time. one tip i always emphasize is to run with a friend. having arunning buddynot only makes the miles go by faster but also keeps you motivated and accountable. it’s a great way to make running more enjoyable and stick to your routine! →adidas ultraboost 5x shoe: i’m currently loving these as my everyday trainers. →adizero prime x 2.0 strung running shoes: these are fun sneakers that provide a little extra spring on the days you need it →nuun sport electrolyte powder packets in pink lemonade flavor: we all know the importance ofstaying hydratedwhether you are a runner or not, and these taste amazing."

"use these universal truths to start going the extra mile with your running, from picking smart goals to learning how to make it feel easier. one of the best things about running is it can be a lifelong pursuit. regardless of age or speed, you can find newways to improve, and you don’t have to look far to see runners getting better at what they love to do. whether it’s winning your age group in a5k, increasing yourmileage, returning to runningpostpartum, or utilizingmental toolsto get stronger in the marathon, there are many ways to make a jump that works for you. in interviews withrunner’s world, elite athletes and coaches shared different strategies that helped them and others reach the next level. here’s what they’ve learned. professional ultrarunner and mental performance coachaddie bracyhas learned becoming a better runner doesn’t always mean getting faster. for years, the 37-year-old has chased time goals as an ncaa all-american, u.s. olympic marathon trials qualifier, and elite 100-mile racer. while speed has been a fulfilling pursuit at various times in her career, it’s far from the only way to measure improvement. bracy says it’s important to be honest with yourself and take inventory of other areas where you can improve beyond speed, as that can often lead to overreaching early in the running process. “it’s easy to think of it as just running faster, when often it’s nutrition,sleepingmore, or strength training.” bracy tries to be intentional about pinpointing an area of improvement during a training block and finding ways to measure the effect for a period of time. for example, she’s currently trying to get better atrunning downhill. this season, she’s incorporated more workouts to help her run efficiently on descents so she can be faster while covering downhill sections of the trail. she’s already seen progress with a recent victory at thetushars mountain runs 70kin july. bonus tip:if you’re feeling fatigued during easy workouts or tired even when you’re resting,nutrition deficiencies may be affecting your running. a nutrition panel and support from a registered dietician can help you plan a successful fueling strategy and lead to major breakthroughs on race day. once you find an area where you can improve, it’s time to dive into goal setting. in his own running career and with the athletes he coaches,gilbert tuhabonye, founder ofgilbert’s gazellesand a survivor of the tutsi-hutu war of burundi, has seen first-hand the power of this practice. from his first race in seventh grade at school in burundi, tuhabonye was hooked on the idea of winning titles. working with his coach on setting goals, establishing benchmarks along the way, and achieving those goals helped the rising track star build self-confidence. early on, goal-setting also helped tuhabonye cope with tragedy. after narrowly escaping a massacre in his hometown, tuhabonye ended up in the hospital with severe burns, but he was determined to return to the sport he loves. he started by walking one lap at a nearby track."
"with the goal of becoming a national champion, tuhabonye made a long-term plan to recover and return to an elite level. for months, he slowly increased the distance on the track and eventually started running again with the help of physical therapy. years later, tuhabonye earned a scholarship to run track for abilene christian university in abilene, texas, where he became an ncaa all-american and eventually a professional runner. looking back on his journey and thinking about the insights he’s gained working with runners of all levels, tuhabonye maintains the importance of accepting the conditions and fitness you’re in beforesetting goalsthat are meaningful to you. if you need some guidance on goal-setting, consider thesmart model—specific, measurable, action oriented, realistic, and timed goals. if the smart model doesn’t appeal to you (studies have shown it can cause heightened pressure and tension for some), open goals—non-specific and exploratory aspirations—are another good place to start. “be yourself. don’t try to be somebody else,” tuhabonye says. “have patience, have a measurable path, and you’ll get there.” as pro marathonerkeira d’amatocan attest, sticking with the training and building on fitness over time is another key component of improvement. the last four years have been transformative for d’amato’s running career, a journey she likes to think of in two acts. the first act was her college years; she raced for american university, where she became a four-time all-american. post-college, d’amatostruggled with injuriesand stopped running competitively after she had ankle surgery in 2009. after a seven-year hiatus from running, which included major life events, like getting married, having two kids with her husband, anthony, and kicking off a career in real estate, d’amato started the second act with an entirely new perspective. “i’ve lived these two separate lives of running, like one where i felt like i wanted so much. i was working hard in the wrong ways. i felt pressure, i was anxious,” d’amato says. “act 2, i’m more chill, more patient, and i’ve seen a lot more success in my personal bests.” this time around, the 2:19 marathoner learned there’s no magic workout that can help you get better. it all comes down to consistency in training. while workouts and long runs are important, one great workout won’t replace a solid week of quality running, d’amato says. “consistency, and what goes along with that is patience, unfortunately nothing happens overnight,” d’amato says. “if you want to build in the right way, you break down your body and then recover, break down and recover, that process takes awhile.” through the highs and lows, d’amato also realized she’ll never regret going all-in on a goal. even if she falls short, she still sees it as an opportunity to grow and ultimately get better as a runner. “when you know you’ve done everything you thought you should, there’s a peacefulness to that. when you don’t regret anything, that makes it easier,” she says. bonus tip:incorporatinga range of workouts to your trainingcan help build speed and endurance while also keeping things interesting throughout the week."
"long runs, recovery days,hill repeats, interval workouts, tempo runs, and fartleks are all key workouts that can benefit your performance in different ways. training your mind is just as important as training your body for running,vanessa peralta-mitchellsays. the certified run coach and founder ofgame changers—an organization dedicated to bringing in more women of color as certified run coaches, leaders, and experts in the running industry—finds that incorporating a mental skills practice can be a huge help when it comes to reaching the next level. in determining areas of improvement, peralta-mitchell recommends starting with a mental clean slate, moving forward without any preconceived ideas of where you should be based on what you’ve done prior. “sometimes that person you were before was great or sometimes it wasn't great, but it doesn’t matter,” peralta-mitchell says. “there are so many different things that brought you to that version of yourself. it’s a huge weight lifted to not take that on and just start anew.” from there, she suggests establishingaffirmations—statements that challenge negative thoughts and reinforce positive emotions—reflecting the latest version of you as a runner and the goals you’re looking to achieve. peralta-mitchell leans into positive phrases and avoids any negative-sounding words, like “don’t,” “won’t,” or “can’t.” the affirmation she’s using right now is “one woman, one goal,” a phrase she repeats in tough training sessions and races to stay present. in honing a mental skills practice, peralta-mitchell findsjournalingto be helpful. keeping a consistent running journal not only helps you track training sessions and mileage, it can also help you process emotions and make key adjustments along the way. “the documentation is priceless and lets you have a record of what things work well and what things maybe you can try differently for next time,” she says. staying healthy has helped propelluis ortato heights he never imagined when he started running as a 13-year-old growing up in caracas, venezuela. over the years, the run coach and professional marathoner has broken national records, competed at world championships, and represented his home country at the 2016 olympic games in rio. looking back, orta credits much of his rise to prioritizingstrength training, stretching, sleep, and taking the utmost precaution when it comes to injury. “my friends make fun of me because sometimes i have stopped running, and they ask me, ‘how much does it hurt?’ and i’m like, it’s a [level] one or a two,” orta says about the importance of listening to your body’s cues if something feels off. “i just don’t want to risk it, and i don’t care about taking one or two more days off because it might make a difference in my training, but it will make a difference in me not getting injured. maybe i exaggerate a little bit, but it’s kept me healthy.” with the exception of one injury that sidelined him for a month, orta has been running healthy for almost 20 years. now with many consistent training blocks behind him, he is chasing the venezuelan national record in the marathon."
"in the spring of 2025, orta aims to break 2:11:25. bonus tip:arunning warmupand several minutes of dynamic stretching can expand your range of motion and also help prevent injury. before your next workout, try incorporating a quick routine of warmup exercises. doing dynamic stretches—think arm circles, inchworms, and hip openers—for at least 30 seconds each helps fire up the muscles before a hard effort. elite runner and coachhiruni wijayaratnestarted to see big gains when she committed to doing workout sessions with runners who were training at a higher level. before recently moving to miami, the sri lankan marathon record-holder lived in boulder, colorado, where she trained with the rise running elite team, a pro group of marathoners led by coach ric rojas. in training, wijayaratne often led the second-fastest group through workouts. but she aspired to be as quick as her training partners, nell rojas and molly grabill, who led the group ahead of her. during one training block, wijayaratne started wondering how fast she could be if she tried to hang onto rojas and grabill’s paces. in a moment of curiosity, she committed to starting workouts with the pair. “the only choice i left for myself was you’re going to hang on and you’re going to hang on for as long as you can,” she says. “when you train with people that are better than you and you just kind of push yourself a little bit and take off the training wheels, there’s a lot of good that can happen on the other side.” while it was difficult at first, the strategy ultimately paid off. in the middle of a long track session, the 2:34 marathoner set a 4:53 personal best in the mile by sticking with rojas and grabill. “there’s magic to be found when you have the confidence to give yourself a shot to try and succeed,” she says. taylor dutch is a writer and editor living in austin, texas, and a former ncaa track athlete who specializes in fitness, wellness, and endurance sports coverage. her work has appeared in runner’s world, self, bicycling, outside, and podium runner. how to strength train for a 5k 20-minute workouts for when you're short on time the shoe behind the women’s marathon record how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week? 10 races you've never heard of fuel with what you want to eat the benefits gained when running becomes habit the best pop songs apply to test shoes and appear on how was your run to run 26.2 is to feel alive the biggest marathon training mistake of all a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"take your miles to the woods with this advice. if you lovenature, including being surrounded by trees, smelling the forest, and listening to the sounds of birds,trail runningmay be the gift that keeps on giving. you don’t even have to live in the country to find trails near you. many cities have parks with paths through the woods, designed specifically for runners. if you’re new to running on trails, though, it does require some differentskillsthan hitting the road. to help you get started, we pulled together a list of our best trail running tips to help every level of runner. yield to other trail users (equestrian, hikers, mountain bikers). generally, downhill runners should yield to uphill runners because the effort to stop and restart on the uphill is greater, and downhill runners often have a better angle of vision. but when in doubt, just be kind and courteous regardless of whether you’re headed up or down. stay on marked trails and run through puddles, not around them (making the trail wider). leave no trace, and don’t litter. everytrailhas its own unique terrain and challenge. there are groomed trails that are wide, limestone-based, and often even in surface, which make for a great introduction to running off the road. and there are narrow “singletrack” trails with a variety of obstacles, including tree roots, rocks, sand, hills, mud, and more. singletrack trails tend to be more challenging, but they offer a dynamic running experience. running off the road can be exhausting at first, especially in the early stages of training, and it may take you up to twice as long to cover a certain distance on a trail than it would if you were on the road. it’s wise to leave your ego at home,slow your pace, and focus on finding a new rhythm. running on trails can also be a lot more demanding than the roads, especially if it’s a technical singletrack trail with roots, rocks, and other fun obstacles. don’t compare your road pace to your trail pace, as you will be slower than your normal road-running pace. instead, develop a trail tempo. run by youreffort level, by yourheart rate, and by the tune of your body. for new trail runners, that may mean walking the hills and running the downhills and flats. no shame in that game. slow build up to running hills, and you’ll prevent injury and burnout along the way. in a matter of weeks, you’ll berunning up hillsyou used to walk, and you’ll develop a sense of being one with the terrain. when heading out to the trails, bring a buddy or dog, if possible, or tell someone where you plan to run, which trails, and how long you expect to be out. bring fuel, fluids, a trail map, id, and cell phone with you for safety, and keep track of where you are along the trail as you go."
"if you run alone, download asafety appfor your phone or use a device with a safety feature, such as the apple watch, and always be mindful of what’s going on around you. it can be tempting to gaze at the nature around you, but doing so can quickly lead to tripping and falling. if you want to enjoy the sights, walk it out or stop; otherwise, focus on looking three to four feet ahead to create a line of travel, or where you going to step for the next few strides. this will keep you focused and in the moment—one of the true gifts of trail running. it’s as much of a physical puzzle as it is a mental one. you will begin to instinctively know where that line is as you become more comfortable running on the trails. because the trails are more demanding, it’s wise torun by timeat first to gain a sense of your trail pacing versus heading out for a six-miler that might take you 40 minutes longer than expected. running an out-and-back course is a great way to get to know your pace and develop your trail running confidence. from there, you can develop loops and routes to fit your needs. adjust your pace according to the terrain and maintain a consistent effort level as you climb uphill. when in doubt, walk. running over downed trees or through mud and sand takes some time getting used to, and it’s best to progress slowly. tackling obstacles will get easier as your body gets stronger and more seasoned on trails. if you’re going to weave trail running into your life, it’s wise to invest intrail running shoes. they differ from road-running shoes in that they’re often beefier to handle rugged terrain but also lower profile (lower to the ground), which reduces the chance of ankle rolls with a high heel. the rugged tread offers better traction on muddy, wet trails. they should fit snug in the heel but have room in the toe box. once you’ve got ’em, take care of them. after a wet or muddy run, remove the insoles, wash off the mud, and stuff with newspaper or paper towels to dry. although many trails provide shaded routes, it’s still wise to wearsunscreen.sunglasses, dark or light, will protect your eyes from tree branches and bushes.wearing a hatand bug spray will help prevent insect bites and deter ticks. grabbing somegaiterswill keep the dirt out of your shoes, too. bringinghydrationwith you on a trail run is a must, as you never know how long it is going to take to complete the workout, or what kind of conditions you may encounter. there are three ways to carry fluids: handheld, multi-bottle waist belt, andhydration pack. find what works best for you then grab it and go. for steep, hilly, or mountainous trails, consider using trekking poles to boost balance, reduce wear and tear on your body (four legs are better than two legs), and boost your hill-climbing strength. using poles can reduce the total impact on the knees and hips."
"plus, you can put rubber pieces on the sticks and use them on the roads, too. take short, quick steps when going up hills and use your arms. remember, some hills are meant to be walked, especially on the technical trails. (it’s common for ultrarunners to walk!) for gradual downhills on groomed trails, lean into thedownhill, open up your stride, and let the hill pull you down. for technical downhills or steep hills, it’s better to use a stair-stepping motion instead; move in a similar motion as you would running down a flight of stairs, keeping your torso tall and letting your legs to do all the work. keep yourarms(elbows) a little wider for added balance on more technical trails with tree roots and rocks. your stride is a little different than on the roads because you will need to clear rocks and tree roots, and lift your feet a little higher off the ground. you also may need to hop left or right to bypass things on the path like tree branches so pump with your arms as you move to maintain momentum. just as runningintervalswill improve your speed, running obstacle repeats on the trail will help create new neuropathways in your brain and boost your technical trail-running skills. for example, warm up for 10 to 15 minutes, then find a relatively flat stretch of the trail and run repeats, focusing onform. include optimal recovery as you would with a speed interval, start with shorter trail segments (20 to 60 seconds), and build to longer stretches (one to three minutes). another way to improve your trail running performance is to include strength and balance exercises into your workout schedule two to three times per week. include moves likelunges, single-leg squats, bridges,push-ups, deadlifts, calf raises, and using a wobble board or bosu to develop foot andankle strengthand stability. it can be tempting to hit the trails frequently at first, but it’s wise to allow for adequaterecovery, as trail running—especially hilly, technical runs—will tax your body more than you may feel. when you run hard or long on the roads, you feel it, but when you run hard on the trails, you may not feel it as much, due to the more forgiving terrain. make sure to weave in trail runs once per week at first, and then progress slowly by adding one trail run per week every two to three weeks. if you plan to run atrail race, aim to build up to running at least twice a week on trails (50 percent of your runs) and the rest on roads. balancing the two will allow you to adapt to the new demands of the trail while maintaining the ability to run on harder surfaces withoutsoreness. start with training on groomed trails, and progress to rugged trails once you have more off-road miles under your belt. there are a variety of ways to find trails, whether close to home or when you travel. there are several apps available, such asalltrails, that will show you nearby trails run by other athletes."

"here’s what you need to know about the shoe ultrarunner kilian jornet wore for his 10th win at sierre-zinal. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? ultrarunner kilian jornet developed loads of running shoes with his sponsors in the past. but now he has his own brand, and he’s doing things his own way. he startednnormalto combine performance with sustainability, making shoes that can stand atop podiums and stay out of landfills longer. the nnormal kjerag first made a big splash when kilian wonhardrock, sierre-zinal, andultra-trail du mont blancall in the same pair of shoes. he logged more than 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) in that single pair. and for his 10th win at sierre-zinal, another pair of the kjerag was on his feet. most of the race shoes in the s/lab sense line that kilian developed withsalomonwere on the minimal side. the kjerag is much more forgiving than those other racers. i’ve found it protects my feet like a shoe that weighs 9 or 10 ounces. that’s partly due to the softer supercritical eva eexpure midsole. the supercritical foaming process is really the only thing keeping eva in the game, as other foams swoop in with higher energy return. (nnormal steered clear of peba due to its tendency to wear more easily.) it still feels highly responsive, but also surprisingly smooth. additional underfoot protection comes from a woven tpu and nylon “ground filter”—a softer take on a rock plate. this prevents you from feeling every little stone underfoot, without impacting the flexibility of the shoe. the outsole also contributes to that extra protection, with full-coverage vibram megagrip litebase rubber. the lugs are on the shorter side—3.5mm—in line with most of the variable-terrain trail shoes out there. while it still feels comfortable on pavement, and grips rocks and roots plenty, i found it can tend to slip out on smoother wet surfaces or mud. runner-in-chief jeff dengate loves the fit and shape of the kjerag, which reminds him a lot of the oldmontrail rogue fly—a trail racing shoe made nearly 15 years ago that was little more than a racing flat with tiny nubs of rubber. but, one key difference between those two is that the kjerag has a lower drop, making the shoe feel a little more jarring to him. topowearers, familiar with the 5mm-and-below drops of many of that brand’s shoes, especially liked the underfoot setup. one told us the kjerag has even knocked her topos out of her shoe rotation, even though she had some trouble with the tongue. “it rubs my ankle if i’m wearing short socks,” she wrote. rather than reach for longer socks, she’s going to trim the tongue—and make the tool suit her task."

"these tried-and-true tips, backed by science, can keep you running long and strong. ask any of your running buddies how to handle pestering running cramps and they’ll probably give you genuine advice like drinkpickle juice, addsalttablets to your water, or eat abanana. and while none of that is necessarilybadadvice, the solution for cramps depends on the source of them—which even experts can’t pinpoint with certainty.“scientists have theories, but it’s hard to do research on cramps because they’re unpredictable and spontaneous,” sayskevin c. miller, ph.d.professor at texas state university's department of health and human performance, and a devoted cramp researcher. in fact, one of miller’s early career tasks was to devise a humane way to induce cramps. (the process he came up with involves electro currents and students’ big toes—he swears it’s not too painful.) but even in a lab, multiple variables can be at play when a cramp occurs. “when i exercise, i losesodium, i becomedehydrated, and i becomefatigued,” miller says. “the problem is all those things are happening at the same time, which makes it difficult to say definitively what’s responsible.” what experts do know is that many common treatments for running cramps have been proven ineffective, which means it’s time to rethink your treatment regimen. here’s what you need to know to prevent leg cramps while running. here are two common theories, backed by scientific research and experts. the best-known theory is also the one with the least amount of scientific support. in 2004,timothy noakes, m.d., ph.d., d.sc., a renowned exercise scientist and professor emeritus at the university of cape town, studied theelectrolytelevels of 43 ultramarathoners. blood tests after a race showed no significant differences in bloodsodiumormagnesiumconcentrations between those who had and hadn’t cramped. there were also no differences in body weight, plasma volume, or blood volume between the two groups, showing thatdehydrationhad no real effect. also, more recently, authors of astudypublished inthe journal of strength and conditioning research,found marathon runners who suffered from muscle cramps associated with exercise, didn’t exhibit a greater degree of dehydration or electrolyte depletion after a marathon but displayed significantly higher concentrations of muscle damage biomarkers. miller agrees that dehydration alone is likely not to blame, because if that could cause amuscle cramp, he theorizes that you could seize up insaunasor hot tubs, or even just walking around on hot days. dehydration, however, could expedite musclefatigue, and that is what miller believes is a likely cause of cramps. in that ultramarathoner study, 100 percent of the runners who cramped did so in either the last half of or right after the race. anecdotally, this theory holds up: most people who cramp seem to be covering longer distances; cramps seem more common at mile 20 of amarathonthan, say, mile two of a5k, and cramps are more likely to happen after about an hour of activity. additionally,speedier runnersseem to be at higher risk. studies have shown that fast-paced ultramarathoners and triathletes had more cramps than their slower counterparts. so consider cramps a scream from your tired muscles that they need a break."
"here are the best strategies for avoiding leg cramps while running: guarding againstmuscle fatigueis key, so don’t take any shortcuts in training. “train more, dolonger distances,” says noakes, a former ultramarathoner. “you have to adapt to the distance you want to race.” this will help you stave off that point of fatigue. miller recommendsplyometricsfor yourstrength-training workouts. these are explosive exercises that may improve the endurance of the receptors that are thought to misfire and cause cramps. if you trained logging 10-minute miles and you start racing 8:45-minute miles, your muscles won’t be prepared for that effort, and you’ll risk cramping, miller says. sopractice your pacingin yourrun workoutsand let that carry over into your races. miller thinks cramps are often caused by the perfect confluence of factors. “if you tend to cramp up at 20 miles, write that down,” he says. “then write down the conditions: was ithot? was ithumid? how much did you drink? what was yournutritionlike the night before? were you acclimated to the heat?” track patterns over time, and you may be able to figure out exactly what makes you cramp. while it’s unclear how much electrolytes will help with cramping, it doesn’t necessarily hurt to drink electrolyte-enhanced water instead of purewater, and onestudyin thejournal of the international society of sports nutrition,points out that it can be helpful. “this is likely because pure water dilutes the electrolyte concentration in our bodies and doesn’t replace what is lost duringsweating,” lead study authorken nosaka, ph.d., director of exercise and sports science at edith cowan university, said in apress release. however,electrolyte drinksare most likely only needed for runs lasting longer than an hour. john vasudevan, m.d. is an associate professor at the university of pennsylvania. he is board-certified in physical medicine & rehabilitation and sports medicine. he is a team physician for upenn athletics and medical director of the broad street run and philadelphia distance run, and previously for the rock 'n' roll half-marathon and tri-rock triathlon in philadelphia. he is a director of the running and endurance sports medicine program at penn medicine. dr. vasudevan provides non-operative management of musculoskeletal conditions affecting athletes and active individuals of all levels, and combines injury rehabilitation with injury prevention. he utilizes a variety of ultrasound-guided procedures and regenerative approaches such as platelet-rich plasma and percutaneous ultrasonic tenotomy. he sees patients at the penn medicine and the philadelphia veterans administration hospital. dr. vasudevan attended medical school at the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health in madison. after his transitional year in tucson, arizona, he went to residency in pm&r at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia and onwards to stanford university for his fellowship in sports medicine. he has been in practice at the university of pennsylvania since 2012. how to fall in love with running how many miles should you run a week?"

"we pick the top kicks for tackling off-road terrain. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? spring into warm weather by taking your run off-road to your local singletrack, rail trail, or fire road. there’s nothing wrong with celebrating the end of winter by pounding the pavement, but getting away from car traffic and smog can really maximize the zen of a daily run. not only does trail running help clear your head, but the uneven terrain will keep your feet and ankles guessing,building strength with each step. likewise, soft surfaces can helpreduce injury riskand allow you to run comfortably for longer stretches. of course, you don’t want to get off on the wrong foot by wearing road shoes to a rocky, muddy route. purpose-built trail shoes feature deeper treads called lugs, which claw into slippery surfaces to improve your traction on soft and uneven ground. softer outsole rubber also provides better grip, and overbuilt uppers protect your foot against impacts and rolled ankles. we deployed our army of wear-testers to help you find the best trail running shoe for your next off-road adventure. whattrail runningmeans to each of us is as varied and unique as the off-road terrain that we cover. to some, it’s a spiritual,transformative experience. but you don’t have to have a transcendentalist mindset or nirvana to qualify as a trail runner. to lots of us, running a short trail adjacent to a local park is simply an easy way to add extra miles onto a regular neighborhood loop. these benefits are equally legitimate, and they’re what inspire ultrarunners and weekend warriors alike to spend more time outside. whatever your preference or personal ideology, we think everyone can be a trail runner, especially with the help of agood pair of shoes. the two main things to consider before purchasing trail running shoes are what type your feet need (think stiff or pliable, neutral or stable, wide or narrow, high or lowheel-to-toe drop) and what type of shoes the terrain demands. with the latter, try to think about whether the trails you encounter are technical or smooth, flat or steep, have loose or firm footing, and whether or not you cross water. rigid shoes with deep lugs (5mm+) are best on technical trails with poor footing, but they’ll also be far less forgiving, even uncomfortable, on road runs. these shoes will serve you better on more rugged terrain and may work for day hiking as well. hybrid shoes have shorter lugs (2mm to 4mm) and a softer on-road feel than their burly siblings. they're well-suited for soft singletrack and local wooded trails that don’t make you slow to a walk due to unsure footing. runner’s worldhas provided expert advice and gear recommendations for all kinds of runners for more than 50 years. our essential recommendations, including all kinds ofrunning shoes, are selected based on the data and insights gathered by our test team, who put the latest and greatest running gear through their paces day in and day out."
"in 2024, therunner’s worldtest team includes runner-in-chief jeff dengate, and test editors amanda furrer and morgan petruny. for the best trail shoes guides, the test team solicited additional recommendations from production manager pat heine, a veteran trail runner who tests off-road shoes, as well as veteran freelancers dan roe and caitlin giddings, who each have extensive shoe testing experience. in addition to our individual test runs, we leveraged the insights from therunner’s worldwear-test program, which recruits more than 275 runners of all abilities, ages, and sizes for real-world wear-testing on paved roads, dirt paths, and rocky singletrack trails. after a month of running more than 100 miles, these testers report their findings on features like fit, comfort, performance, and ride. we recommended the best trail running shoes based on a wealth of experience and data gathered by therunner’s worldtest team, including down and dirty hands-on testing experience by our editors, data gathered by therunner’s worldwear test group, and additional research provided by our contributors. these shoes deserve special recognition because of their value and overall performance, both on foot and in the lab. saucony’s most popular trail shoe rolls into 2024 with a new pwrrun+ sockliner that adds cushioning to every step. the eva-based pwrrun midsole returns, delivering solid energy return so you aren’t trading pep in your step for grip off-road. we found the v14 builds on the peregrine’s versatility for longer distances without sacrificing agility or responsiveness. the new design also has a redesigned mesh upper that adds more padding in the tongue and around the heel collar, which should help you get a snug fit at the ankle without pinching. it weighs a few tenths of an ounce more, but that’s not enough that you’ll really notice. these updates may feel minor, but that isn’t a bad thing. we’ve long enjoyed the peregrine’s winning formula, which is just as suited for newbies’ first footprints on a muddy trail as it is for shielding vert-chasers’ toes on rock-strewn singletrack. and, it’s earned multiple awards from our team over the years for its versatility—across terrains, foot shapes, and distances—at a price that doesn’t break the bank. if you plan to run every day, rain or shine, the peregrine 14 also comes in a“gtx” variantwith a waterproof gore-tex lining, which is ideal for keeping your feet dry when the skies open up on your trail adventure. buy men’sbuy women’s over the years, the merrell moab has evolved into the most popular and most sold boot in the world, and has spawned several variations. the moab flight, a low pared-down version of the original, gives trail runners a taste of the moab action. a taller drop and stout build preserve some of that “fast hiker” feel, but also make the flight more accessible to runners coming from high-offset road trainers like thebrooks ghostorasics gel-kayano. the flight uses none of the dense eva foam found on the original moab, and instead recruits merrell’s new floatpro midsole."
"the material feels lighter and softer, and relies on its thickness rather than a rock plate to add protection underfoot. it results in a burlier ride, but offers a seriously appealing amount of cush per dollar. (testers only felt stones poking through the softer midsole on more rugged technical trails.) if you’re looking for a blazing-fast merrell, we recommend the newmtl skyfire 2. buy men’sbuy women’s “this isn’t a workout or fast race shoe. this is the long-haul shoe,” one of our wear-tester declared of the topo athletic ultraventure 3. according to one of our wear-testers,shoes with wide toeboxeslike the ultraventure are perfect for ultrarunners. the outsole, made of grippy vibram rubber, is more lightweight and sectional than that of the previous iteration. its 3.5mm lugs are shorter and wider as well, making the shoe versatile for both roads and trails. “the vibram outsole is sticky enough for rocky trails, but it’s not like a cleat,” said another tester. even though the shoe doesn’t have a rock plate, the increased stack height—topo added 5mm to the heel and forefoot—serves as a buffer on rugged terrain. the thicker midsole is composed of a new zipfoam compound that’s lighter and more responsive than before. (it’s the same bouncy material used in topo’sultraventure promodel.) to ensure stability, the platform was widened, too. still, you’ll want to choose the brand’smtn racerorterraventure, which have toothier treads, if you’re heading down gnarlier trails. buy men’sbuy women’sfull review though the “gtx” distinction suggests ankle-high waterproofness, the material only reaches to the top of the laces. the gaiter collar is instead a stretchy fabric, preferable for shielding against small debris and light drizzle. not suited for deeper creek diving, this construction does breathe easier. after splashing through shallow riverbeds and rain-filled potholes, no testers reported the soggy wet squish they’d sometimes feel after sealing their feet inside gore-tex. interestingly, many runners will grab the gtx version for reasons other than waterproofness. the shoe’s outsole uses a different rubber than the non-gtx version. nike finally made the switch to a stickier rubber. “the shoe performed wonderfully on all surfaces, especially the road,” said one tester, who put more than 120 miles on the shoe, equally split between road and trail surfaces. buy women’sfull review thespeedgoatmight behoka’smost popular trail shoe, but we think the overhauled mafate speed 4 is actually the better pick right now—especially if your trails require comfort and versatility. we found this out firsthand by using the shoe to race up and down whiteface mountain. with a wide range of trail options to pick from, the mafate was our race day choice as we tackled the olympic ski hill in new york’s adirondack park. it had more than enough bite on black diamond ski trails to let me claw my way uphill, and the cushioning protected my body when i had to dash back down 4,000 vertical feet over just 3.4 miles."
"hoka made a number of key updates to make the mafate speed 4 a more runnable and comfortable shoe than its predecessors, including a new two-layer foam setup. the profly+ midsole puts a lightweight, bouncy foam closest to your foot, which boosts comfort and makes the shoe feel alive when you’re running along hard-packed ground. the bottom layer is durable and firm enough to crush over sizable rocks and protect the bottom of your foot. when you get into steep or muddy terrain, the shoe still shines. the outsole has been redesigned and there’s more rubber underfoot. each lug has three distinct tiers, giving you an enormous amount of sharp edges to cling to the ground. plus, it’s litebase, to help keep weight in check—litebase makes the sole thinner and lighter, without diminishing traction. buy men’sbuy women’sfull review brooks debuted the catamount 3 trail racing shoe in early 2024, building on the success of the previous version’s lightweight and responsive, yet still protective midsole. the key upgrade comes in the form of a new single-layer engineered mesh upper, which delivers a comfortable, sock-like fit, while tpu overlays provide structure to keep your foot secure and protected. it fits a little snugger thanbrooks’ road shoes, but that’s a good thing here: a tight wrap will help you avoid rolling an ankle on rocky, uneven terrain. the catamount 3’s skyvault midsole plate enhances proficiency on the uphill, then smooths and stabilizes the ride on your descent, priming it for rolling trails. the plate’s rocker-style shape is curved in the forefoot to help propel you quicker off your toes on the ascents, and doubles as a rock shield. testers found that thecatamount 2’soutsole, which returns in the catamount 3, felt “super grippy” on wet logs and in freezing rain. they dug the energy return from the midsole (also unchanged in the new version), noting that they felt a “pop” on technical trails. buy men’sbuy women’s the altra lone peak gets tougher in 2024. the lone peak 8 adds an updated ripstop mesh upper, which includes ghillie lacing for a locked-in, customizable fit. tpu overlays keep your foot planted and protect your toes from impacts. both of these upgrades should improve the shoe’s durability and performance in technical terrain. altra doesn’t have to change much to keep the lone peak 8 in the trail shoe pantheon. it already had an award-winning midsole and outsole, both which return in the new design. altra’s roomy, anatomical foot shape allows your toes to splay naturally. (it’s tough to really grasp how much your trail shoes may be jamming your toes together until you experience a natural fit like this.) altra’s signature zero-drop designkeeps 25mm of cushioning beneath your foot in the front and back of the shoe, which takes some getting used to. tread carefully if you’re coming from a 10mm drop shoe, which requires less flexibility in your foot and ankle. if you dig the wide shape and zero-drop design, though, you’ll be rewarded by immense traction and comfort."
"“the route i run most is a 4-mile loop on a mountain that has every kind of surface that one can expect to get in pennsylvania—gravel, technical downhills, rocky climbs, and water crossings,” said one tester who put more than 150 miles on the previous version of the shoe. “this shoe grips all of it. the traction is fantastic, and the cushioning is ample, but still allows for ground feel and solid footing on rock.” buy men’sbuy women’s salomon’ssense ridehas been a cult favorite among both beginners and longtime trail racers. its firm, durable cushioning handles daily jogs and long runs comfortably, and the moderate heel-toe offset feels accessible to low-drop and high-drop runners alike. the pulsar trail has similar traits, but adds an energy-return boosting perk—a propulsive tpu plate thatsalomoncalls “energy blade”—for just a $10 price bump. testers said the pulsar feels slightly softer and more responsive than the sense ride, and praised its reliable traction and secure inner fit sleeve. “the cushioning is protective and bouncy, but not super plush. i didn’t feel sharp rocks underfoot and my turnover still felt fast,” said one tester who logs about 50 miles of road-to-trail running per week. “there’s a slick and mossy flat rock on the warren highlands trail that i test every trail shoe on. i’ve bit the dirt many times on it, but not while wearing the pulsar. i felt super confident bombing down the descent.” buy men’sbuy women’s with the originaltrailfly g 270(first released as the terraultra g 270), inov8 debuted a new iteration of its powerflow foam. the cushioning incorporates more tpu in the mix, which feels more forgiving while returning more energy to your stride. sitting on top of that midsole is a fresh footbed to match. (made from tiny compressed tpu beads, it’s more responsive than a regular foam or gel insole.) together, these two elements combine for a ride that feels like a firm salomon with some subtle bouncyadidasboost undertones—without losing good connection to the trail. that energetic midsole returns in version 2.0. in this update,inov8focused on the upper, improving the overall stretch and breathability of the material to let your pinky toes splay and breathe easier. testers told us the additional padding around the ankle collar also feels softer and locks down the heel more securely. buy men’sbuy women’s the bushido has been around for awhile, but it continues to earn a spot on this list. why? this burly trail crusher brings plenty of structure and support to a responsive platform. but the outsole is what we like most—sticky, aggressive lugs line the perimeter and bottom of the shoe, making it easy to virtually grab hold of uneven terrain. we also appreciated the heavy-duty toe cap, which protects the foot should you kick into rocks. a breathable mesh upper and just the right amount of cushion in the midsole make this standout shoe versatile enough to manage long, slow mileage as well as speed workouts."
"buy men’sbuy women’sfull review while many vj shoes, including themaxxand thextrm, are designed for obstacle course racing and trail running, theultrais specifically designed for long-distance. it adds more cushioning underfoot, which feels lightweight yet ample for spending hours to days on the trail. the best part of vj shoes is still the traction, though, and the ultra lives up to the brand’s slogan, “#bestgripontheplanet.” the butyl-rubber outsole is studded with 4mm, chevron-shaped lugs, which give the ultra a tacky hold on wet, jagged surfaces. “the traction this shoe had in all conditions was insane,” said one tester. “i ran these shoes through everything from bone-dry trails to monsoon summer rainstorms and was blown away—definitely the most grip i’ve had on a trail shoe, hands down. on short road stretches, the feeling is like walking across a dirty dive bar floor on a hot summer day—sticky.” full review what makes a great trail shoe? it depends on the trails and the runner, but you generally want to see thicker and softer outsole rubber than you find on a road shoe. the midsole may be made of a similar material, but it should include a rock plate (a plastic plate embedded in the foam) if your trails include sharp rocks and stones. for the upper, fit and protection are critical—you don’t want to roll an ankle as the shoe rotates about your foot, or break a toe from accidentally kicking a boulder. to prevent those misfortunes, trail shoes come with reinforced uppers in the form of tpu overlays at the midfoot and toe box. do i need my trail shoe to be waterproof? some trail shoes have lining made from gore-tex or a similarly waterproof material to keep your dry on wet trails. that sounds like a big benefit at a glance, but the reality is a little more complicated. there are pros and cons to wearingwaterproof running shoes. on the plus side, your feet will stay dry for longer when you're running through a rainstorm, which can help you avoid soggy feet and blisters. that said, even the most waterproof trail shoes will eventually get saturated in a downpour, and they don’t tend to drain as well once they do get wet. also, waterproof membranes that keep moisture out will also lock moisture in: that keeps sweat vapor from escaping your shoes. no matter your approach, yourrunning socksare key for moisture management: thin, synthetic materials dry out quicker and don’t hold as much water, meaning less added weight on your feet. what is shoe “drop?” if you’ve read shoe guides fromrunner’s worldbefore, you may have noticed that we always highlight the“drop”of every shoe we recommend. drop, or heel-toe offset, is the difference between the amount of material beneath your heel and your forefoot. for example, a shoe with 10mm of drop might have 25mm of foam and rubber beneath your heel and 15mm beneath your forefoot. your feet may agree with a variety of drop measurements, but shoes with less drop require more flexibility in your foot and ankle."

"experts explain why your body slows down and what you can do about it. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? in 2008, fresh into a new masters age group, i ran a 5k. nothing unusual in that—i’d run spring 5ks for quite a few years. the surprise was that i was 45 seconds faster than i’d been in any recent year. age-graded, it was a massive pr. short course, i thought, but a couple weeks later, i did it again, then twice more. friends were wondering about my training. “what are you doing differently?” they asked. when i went back and looked at my training logs, the answer was surprising: i’d cutbackmy mileage. i’d done it simply because i was busy, but as the winter progressed, my speed workouts had responded. for masters runners, less is often more. aging, like injuries, is one of those things most of us prefer to deny. “it’ll never happen to me,” goes the common decree. but as a non-running friend once said about her graying hair, “consider the alternative.” eventually, we’re all either going to become masters runners...or not be runners. the options are limited. internet fountain-of-youth claims notwithstanding, the passage of years does indeed affect athletic performance. theamerican college of sports medicinesuggests a depressing litany of time’s tolls: declining vo2max, reduced strength, increased body fat, reduced lactic acid clearance, declining bone density, and more. not to mention heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and declining mental acuity. put these together and, according to data compiled byworld masters athletics, runners slow about 7 percent per decade in their 40s, 50s, and 60s (and more quickly after that). the better we understand this process, the easier it is to beat the aging curve. even if we merely reduce the rate at which the years affect our speed, that’s a victory—the runner’s version of aging gracefully. but it doesn’t take a total revision of training philosophy. “you don't have to do a lot different,” says greg mcmillan, m.s., exercise physiologist, running coach, and founder ofmcmillan running. “the physiological reactions in the body and the adaptations you want to get are the same.” in other words, we merely have to modify how we do things, not what we do. here, we take a look at what the science behind what happens to your vo2max, flexibility, muscle power, and recovery as you age. one indisputable effect of aging is declining aerobic horsepower. classically, this is measured via vo2max—or your maximum rate of oxygen usage per unit of body weight. for sedentary people, vo2max typically declines by about 10 percent per decade after age 30. for athletes who keep in training, the rate of decline can often be held to about half that. most runners associate this with reduced cardiac capacity. with age, there is a steady fall in the number of receptors in your heart muscle listening to the nervous system’s signals telling it how fast to beat."
"as the heart becomes increasingly deaf to these messages, its maximum rate drops about one beat per minute each year. there also appears to be a decline in the heart’s intrinsic ability to beat quickly. “it’s not so much that the heart can’t beat as quickly, though that’s probably true,” saysbenjamin levine, m.d., founder and director of the institute for exercise and environmental medicine at texas health presbyterian hospital. “the heart can’t relax as quickly. out of all the factors that are probably an inevitable part of aging and not modifiable by training patterns, this is it. our data have shown that masters athletes have youthful, compliant— or ‘stretchy’—hearts that fill well at low pressures. however, no amount of training was able to prevent the slowing of relaxation.” many people simply presume that this decline in heart rate is the cause of age-related vo2max decline. but the reality appears to be considerably more complex. what counts is the ability of the heart to pump blood, and that’s comprised of two factors: heart rate and stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped with each beat). inone study, levine and colleague darren mcguire had a unique opportunity to study the effect of 30 years of aging on a small cohort of ordinary individuals. (other long-term studies had involved elite athletes, a group that might not be representative of the rest of us.) the study began in the 1960s, when five college students volunteered for three weeks’ total bed rest. their catastrophic declines in aerobic conditioning are a major reason why nurses now prod surgical patients out of bed as quickly as possible. but before being put to bed, the young men were subjected to the type of testing normally reserved for elite athletes. thirty years later, mcguire and levine retested the same men in their early 50s. the follow-up study revealed that the intervening decades hadn’t been as hard on their vo2max values as the three weeks’ bed rest. of greater interest, though, was the discovery that the men’s stroke volumes had increased. it was already known that this happens, as the heart enlarges to force blood through age-stiffened arteries. but nobody anticipated the magnitude of the effect. it turned out to be more than enough to compensate for the decline in maximum heart rate. a 50-year-old’s heart might not beat as rapidly as it once did, but it can pump at least as much blood per minute. what this means is that changes in vo2max aren’t entirely driven by changes in the heart. if the heart is delivering as much oxygen as before, but vo2max is declining, it must be that the muscles are becoming less adept at using it. what precisely is going on is a subject of considerable dispute. partly, it’s simply that people lose muscle mass with age—smaller muscles use less oxygen. but other factors are probably also involved. perhaps aging muscles have fewer capillaries to supply them with blood. maybe they’re less able to call for blood when they need it."
"or perhaps their cells have fewer mitochondria (the powerhouses in which oxygen is used). perhaps their arteries become increasingly clogged or inelastic. a more complex theory comes fromtim noakes, m.d., professor emeritus and former director of the research unit of exercise science and sports medicine at the university of cape town. he argues that for each stride, the aging brain may simply be using a lower fraction of the available muscle cells. physiologists have long known that for any given movement, our nerves recruit only a fraction of each muscle’s fibers, letting the others rest. inlore of running, noakes suggests that as we age, our nervous systems may become more cautious about protecting our muscles from overload. (this is, however, an extremely controversial theory that has provoked outspoken dissent from other scientists.) whatever the cause, the solution is fairly straightforward: run. others believe speedwork factors into the mix (reducing the number of longer runs). “train fairly hard at your 2-mile or 5k pace at least once a week, where you’re running your heart rate up to 98 percent of maximum,” saysbob williams, portland-based running coach “i'm a real believer in that.” mcmillan agrees: “these are great things to include in your training program,” he says of 5k-paced workouts. “i wouldn’t say year-round, but frequently.”he also recommends racing frequently, perhaps once every three to six weeks, particularly 5ks. “that’s a great vo2max workout in and of itself. the more i look at masters runners, the more i think you’ve got to keep racing. you almost go back togeorge sheehan. he was the king of racing every weekend. it doesn’t have to be 100 percent, and you can’t do long. the more 5ks and 8ks you can do, the better. this is completely different from what you’d advise for a 23-year-old who wants to go to the olympics.” one of the people involved in mcguire and levine’s study was gregg hill. at 20 years old, hill was a college sophomore who ran a 4:45 mile. at the end of the follow-up study’s intensive training, his vo2max had been restored—but not the 4:45 mile. clearly, aerobic capacity isn’t the only factor affecting masters performance. “what determines speed on the track is different from vo2max,” levine says. also cutting into your speed is a simple loss of range of motion—a problem most runners have faced since youth, but which intensifies with age. part of the difficulty is the typical middle-aged lifestyle. mcmillan notes that many masters-age runners spend a lot of their work lives sitting at their desks or in meetings. “we’ve risen to a level [in our jobs] that can be bad for us,” he says. ""we’re doing a lot of things that don’t have us moving. that’s the worst thing we can do from a flexibility standpoint.” once your muscles start to get tight, you’re limiting your power base, according to williams. “you’re not going to be able to move as smooth and efficiently.” the solution is stretching."
"the idea is to get blood flowing through the connective tissues, best done by stretching them dynamically before the workout, and statically afterward. williams generally has runners do 15 to 20 minutes of dynamic drills while warming up. in particular, he says, dynamic exercises should focus on your calves, hamstrings, and hips. but stretching isn’t the only thing that can help retain or restore flexibility. “use a foam roller four to five days a week,” williams says. “or get a massage every week or two. the foam roller seems to be the primary tool i’ve found that keeps competitive runners healthy.” tension release$30 | reibuy now ice without the mess$30 | amazonbuy now relieves stiffness$349 | hypericebuy now promotes circulation$1495 | amazonbuy now deep-tissue massage$129 | roll recoverybuy now alternatively, if you want to retain flexibility but don’t want it to feel quite so regimented, williams suggests trying some other sport that works your range of motion. williams suggests tennis, but pretty much anything is better than nothing, even golf. “there are a lot of things you can do,” he says. “you don’t need a gym.” mcmillan agrees. experiment with different types of flexibility training, he says. “as a masters runner, you’ve got to investigate and find the methods that work.” [run faster, stronger and longer with this 360-degree training program.] another indisputable side effect of aging is a decline in muscle mass. according to theamerican college of sports medicine, muscle strength and mass begin decreasing at age 40, with the process speeding up after age 65 or 70. of particular concern to runners, the loss generally occurs fastest in the lower body. the rate of loss appears to be faster for fast-twitch fibers than for slow-twitch. that’s a greater problem for sprinters than for distance runners, but it should be of concern for everyone because it’s possible to lose all of your fast-twitch fibers. and when that happens, nobody knows how to get them back. scott trappe, ph.d., director of the human performance laboratory at ball state university, was the head of the team that made this discovery. the likely reason, he said at the time, is changing lifestyles. as people age, particularly into their 70s and 80s, they stop doing the high-intensity activities that call for fast-twitch fibers. the result is that these fibers atrophy until they’re gone—permanently. “the body is going to react to demands,” adds brown. “if you don’t demand it any more—if you think, ‘i’m too old to do this, and i’m not strong enough anyway,’ then you’ll start to lose muscle mass.” the solution is vigorous weight training at whatever weight you can handle—and fancy gym machines aren’t necessary. rubber tubing, free weights, stretchy bands, calisthenics— any of those can help. “as long as you’re doing something two or three days a week to push yourself to a point where you’re saying, ‘this is starting to get pretty hard,’” williams says. the best masters runners never stop, adds mcmillan. “they seem to be always training and racing—that may help,” he says."
"“the initial research was showing that if you just keep with it, you can reduce that loss of muscle composition.” none of these approaches works if you push too hard, too often. “all the evidence i read doesn’t suggest that you can actually slow the aging process,” noakes says. “in contrast, i think you can accelerate the aging process if you overdo the exercise.” for younger athletes, he thinks overdoing it is running more than about two hours a day. but many masters runners find that it takes longer than it once did to recover from workouts and races. lots of factors may be involved, but the simplest to understand is at the cellular level, where tissue repair and replacement simply don’t occur as rapidly as they once did. what this means is that as you age, you may have to experiment with changing your workout pattern. according to mcmillan, masters runners need to do every type of workout that younger runners do, but they may need to alter their schedules. and they may need to allow more time to adapt. stick with speedwork, a tempo run, and a long run each week but space them out. “ that’s going to be different for every runner,” he says. masters runners also need to be careful to allow enough recovery time after races. in the end, you can’t turn back time, but if you learn how to train smarter—not harder—as you age, there’s still a great chance you can nab a few more prs. everything you need to know about hip pain how to increase mileage running periodized training can help you hit your goals marathon pace charts for fine-tuning training first boston marathon? here‘s what to know foods that cut inflammation to improve performance how to estimate your lactate threshold pace how to plan your 2024 race schedule ultramarathons—you can go farther than 26.2 miles the benefits of resistance sprints new york city marathon 2023 faq why you need to slow down on your recovery runs a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"she stunned the world (and herself) with olympic bronze in tokyo. then life went sideways. how america’s unexpected marathon phenom is getting her body—and brain—back on track. on a clear december night in 2019, molly seidel was at a rooftop holiday party in boston, wearing a black velvet dress, doing what a lot of 25-year-olds do: passing a joint between friends, wondering what she was doing with her life. “you should run theolympic trials,” her sister, izzy, said, as smoke swirled in the chilly air atop the trackhouse, a retail shop and community hub on newbury street operated by the running brand tracksmith. “that would be hilarious if you did that as your first marathon.” molly, an elite10kracer who’d spent much of 2019 injured, looked out at the city lights, and laughed. why the hell not? she’d just qualified for the trials, winning the san antonio half with a time of 1:10:27. (“the shock of the century,” as she’d put it.) true, 13.1 miles wasn’t 26.2—but running amarathonwas something to do. if only because she never had before. a four-time ncaa track and cross-country champion at the university of notre dame in indiana, molly had moved to boston in 2017, where she’d worked three jobs to supplement her fourth: running forsaucony’s freedom track club. the $34,000 a year that saucony paid her (pre-tax, sans medical) didn’t go far in one of america’s most expensive cities. chasing kids around as a babysitter, driving around as an instacart shopper, and standing around eight hours a day as a barista—when you’re running 20 miles a day—wasn’t ideal. but whatever, she hadcompression socks. and she was downing free coffee and paying rent, flying to flagstaff, arizona, every so often for altitude camps, and having a good time. doing what she loved. the only thing she’s ever wanted to do since she was a freckly fifth-grader in small-town wisconsin clocking a six-minute mile in gym class. “i was hustling, and i loved it. it was such a fun, cool time of my life,” she says, summarizing her 20s. staring into molly’s steely brown eyes, listening to her speak with such clarity and conviction about her struggles since, it’s easy to forget: she is still only 29. after molly had hip surgery on her birthday in july 2018, her doctors gave her a 50/50 chance of running professionally again. by summer 2019, she’d parted ways with ftc, which left her sobbing on the banks of the charles river, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and uncertainty. her biggest achievement lately had been being named #2 top instacart shopper (in flagstaff; boston was big-time). subscribe to our newsletter for exclusive access to more great stories about running! the day after that rooftop party, molly asked her friend and former ftc teammate jon green, who she’d newly anointed as her coach: “think i should run the marathon trials?” sure, he shrugged. nothing to lose. maybe it’d help her train for the 10k, her best shot—they both thought—at making a u.s. olympic team."
"“i’m going to get my ass kicked six ways to sunday!” she told the host of the podcastrunning on omsix weeks before thetrials in atlanta. instead, on february 29, 2020, she kicked some herself. pushing past 448 of the fastest, most-experienced women marathoners in the country, coming in second with a 2:27:31, earning more in prize money ($60,000) than she had in two years of racing—and a spot on the u.s. trio for the 2020 tokyo olympics, along with kenyan-born superstarsaliphine tuliamukand sally kipyego. “i don’t know what’s happening right now!” molly kept saying into tv cameras, wrapped in an american flag, as stunned as a lottery winner. saucony who?pumacame calling. along with something molly hadn’t anticipated: the spotlight. an onslaught of social media followers. and two weeks later, a global pandemic and lockdown—and all the anxiety and isolation that came with it. she was drowning, and she hadn’t even landed in tokyo yet. the 2020 olympics,as we all know, were postponed to 2021. an emotional burden but a physical boon for molly, in that it allowed her to get in a second marathon. inlondon, she finished two minutes faster than her debut. when the olympics finally rolled around, she was ready. before the race, molly says, “i was thinking: ‘once i cross the starting line, i get to call myself an olympian and that’s a win for the day.’” but then she crossed the finish line—with a finger-kiss to the sky and a gutturalyesss!—inthird placewith a 2:27:46, just 26 seconds behind first (kenya’s peres jepchirchir). and realized: she gets to call herself an olympic medalist forever. only the third american woman to ever earn one in the marathon. lots of kids have fleeting hopes of making it to the olympics. i remember thinking i could be mary lou retton. maybe flojo, with shorter fingernails. then i decided i’d rather be madonna or president of the united states and promptly forgot about it. but molly held tight to her olympic aspirations. she still has a poster she made in 2004, with stickers and a snapshot of her smiley 10-year-old self, to prove it. “i wish i will make it into the olympics and win a gold medal,” she wrote, and signed it: molly seidel, the “y” looping back to underline her name. in case there was any doubt as to who, specifically, would be winning the medal. molly grew up in nashotah, wisconsin, and is the eldest of three. her sister and brother, younger by not quite two years, are twins. izzy is a running influencer and corporate content creator for companies like peloton; and fritz favors formula 1 racing and weightlifting and works for the family’s leather-tanning business. the family was active, sporty. dad, fritz sr., was a ski racer in college; mom, anne, a cheerleader. you can tell. watching clips of molly’s mom and dad watching the olympic race from their backyard patio, jumping up and down, tears streaming, is the kind of life-affirming moment you wish you could bottle. “i’m in shock."
"i’m in disbelief,” molly says into the mic, beaming. “i just wanted to come out today and i don’t know…stick my nose where it didn’t belong and see what i could come away with. and i guess that’s a medal.” when the interviewer holds up her family on facetime, molly breaks down. “we did it,” she says into the screen between sobs and smiles. “please drink a beer for me.” molly hasn’t alwaysbeen unabashedly herself, even when everyone thought she was. a compartmentalizer to the core, she spent most of her life hiding a huge part of it: anorexia, bulimia, anxiety, obsessive-​compulsive disorder, debilitating depression. it started around age 11, when she learned to disguise ocd tendencies, like compulsively knocking on wood, silently reciting prayers “to avoid god getting mad at me,” she says. “it was a whole thing.” she says her parents were aware of the behaviors, but saw them more as odd little habits. “they had no reason to suspect anything. i was very high-functioning,” she says. “they didn’t realize that it was literally taking over my life.” she wasn’t officially diagnosed with ocd until her freshman year of college, when she saw a therapist for the first time. at notre dame,disordered eatingtook hold, quietly yet visibly, as it does for up to 62 percent of female college athletes, according to the national eating disorders association. as recently as the tokyo olympics, she was making herself throw up in the airport bathroom, mere days before taking the podium. molly hesitates to share that detail; she fears a girl might read this and interpret it as behavior to model. “having been in that place as a younger athlete, i know i would have,” she says. but she also understands: most people just don’t get how unrelenting eating disorders can be. in february 2022, she finally received a diagnosis of the root cause for all of it: adhd. about being diagnosed, she says, “it made me feel really good, like [i don’t have] a million different disorders. i have a disorder that manifests itself in a lot of different symptoms.” she waited to try adderall until after the boston marathon in april, only todrop outat mile 16 due to a hip impingement. initially, the meds made her feel fantastic. focused. free. until she realized adderall hurt more than it helped. she couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, lost too much weight. within weeks, she devolved. “the eating disorder came roaring back,” she says, referring to it, as she often does, as its own entity, something that exists outside of herself. that ruthlessly takes control over her very need for control. “i almost think of it as an alter ego,” she explains. “adderall was just bubblegum in the dam,” as she puts it. she ditched the drug, and her life—professionally, physically—unraveled. in july 2022, heading into the world championships, she bombed the mental health screening, answering the questions with brutal honesty. she’d been texting keira d’amato weeks prior. “yo girl, things are pretty bad right now."
"get ready…” sobbing on the sidewalk in eugene, oregon, she texted d’amato again. and the usatf made it official:d’amato would take her spot on the team. then molly did what she’d been “putting off and putting off”— checked herself into eating disorder treatment for the second time since 2016, an outpatient program in salt lake city, where her new boyfriend was living at the time. somehow (see: expert compartmentalizer) mid-meltdown, in february 2022, she had met an amateur ultrarunner named matt, on hinge. a quiet, lanky photographer, he didn’t totally get what she did. “i didn’t understand the gravity of it,” he tells me. “i was like, oh she’s a pro runner, that’s cool. i didn’t realize she was, like,thepro runner!” going back to treatment “was pretty terrible,” she says. at least she could stay with matt. hardly a honeymoon phase, but the new relationship held promise. “i laid it all out there,” says molly. “and he was still here for it, for all the messiness. it was really meaningful.” and a mental shift. “he doesn’t see me as just molly the runner.” almost a yearlater, on a freezing april evening in flagstaff, molly is racing around whole foods, palming a head of cabbage, grabbing a thing of hummus, hunting for deals even though she doesn’t need to anymore. “it’s all about speed, efficiency, and quality,” she says, explaining the secret to her earlier instacart success. she checks the expiration date on a container of goat cheese and beelines for the butcher counter, scans it faster than an epson ds3000, though not without calculation, and requests two tomato-and-mozzarella-stuffed chicken breasts. then she darts over to the beverage aisle in her marshmallow-y puma slip-ons that matt custom-painted with orange poppies. she grabs a case of la croix (tangerine), then zips to the checkout. we’re in and out in under 15 minutes and 50 bucks, nothing bruised or broken. other than her body. let’s just say: if molly were an avocado or a carton of eggs, she probably wouldn’t pass her own sniff test. the week we meet, she is just coming off a month of no running. not a single mile. she’s used to running twice a day, 130 miles a week. no wonder she’s spraying her kitchen counter with mrs. meyer’s and scrubbing the stovetop within minutes of welcoming me into her new home. the place, which she shares with matt and his australian border collie, rye, has a post-college flophouse feel: a deep l-shaped couch draped in pendleton blankets, a bar cluttered with bottles of discount wine, a floor lamp leaning like the tower of pisa next to a chew toy in the shape of a ranch dressing bottle. scattered about, though, are reminders that an elite runner sleeps here. or at least tries to. (“pro runner by day, mild insomniac by night” reads the bio on her rarely used account on what used to be twitter.) there’s a stick of chafe safe on the coffee table. shalane flanagan’s cookbooks on the counter."
"and framed in glass, propped on the office floor: molly’s olympic kit—blue racing briefs with the nike swoosh, a usa singlet, her once-sweat-drenched american flag, folded in a triangle. “i’m not sure where to hang it,” she says. “it seems a little ostentatious to have it in the living room.” with long brown curls and a round, freckly face, molly has an aw-shucks look so innocent that it’s hard, at first, to perceive her struggles. flat-out ask her, though—how are you even functioning?—and she’ll tell you: “i’m an absolute wreck. there’s no worse feeling than being a pro runner who can’t run. you just feel fucking useless.” tidying a stack of newspapers, she adds, “don’t worry, i’ve had therapy today.” she’s watched every show. (saveted lasso, “too sickly sweet.”) listened to every podcast. (armchair expertis a favorite.) she’s got nothing else to do but pt and go easy on the elliptigo in the garage, onto which she’s rigged a wooden bookstand, currently clipped witha history of god: the 4,000 year quest of judaism, christianity and islam. “i don’t read running books,” she says. “i need something different.” like most runners—even the most amateur among us—running, moving, is what keeps her sane. “what about swimming? can you at least swim?” i ask, projecting my own desperation if i were in her size 8.5 shoes. “i fucking hate swimming,” says molly. walking? “oh, yeah, i can go on walks. another. long. walk.” the only thing she has on her schedule this week is pumping up a local middle school track team before their big meet. the invitation boosted her spirits. “should i just memorizemiracle on ice?” she says, laughing. “no, i know, i’ll doindependence day.” injuries are nothing new for molly. par for the course for any professional athlete. but especially for women, like her, who lack bone density—and have since high school, when, according to a study in theorthopedic journal of sports medicine, nearly half of female runners experience period loss.osteoporosisand its precursor, osteopenia, are rampant in female runners, leading to ongoing issues that threaten not just their college and professional running careers, but their lives. still, molly admits, laughing: she’s especially accident-prone. i ask her to list every scratch she’s ever had, which takes her 10 minutes, and goes all the way back to babyhood, when she banged her head against the bathtub spout. there was a cracked spine from a sledding incident in 8th grade, a broken collarbone from a ski race in high school, shredded knee cartilage in college when a driver hit her while she was riding a bike. “ribs are constantly breaking,” she says. in 2021, two snapped, and refused to heal in time for thenew york city marathon. no biggie. she ran through the pain with a 2:24:42, besting deena kastor’s 2008 time by more than a minute and setting the american course record. molly’s latest injury? glute tear. “literally a gigantic pain in the ass,” she posted on instagram in march. inside, molly was devastated."
"pulling out of the nagoya marathon—the night before her 6:45 a.m. flight to japan, no less—was not in the plan. the plan, according to coach green, had been simple. it always is. if the two of them even have one. “just to have fun and be consistent.” and get a marathon or two in before the olympic trials in february 2024. she’d been finally—finally—fit on all fronts; ready to race, ready to return. she needed nagoya. and then, nothing. “it feels like i’m back at the bottom of the well,” says molly, driving home from whole foods in her toyota 4runner. “this last year-and-a-half has been so difficult. it’s just been a lot of doubt. how do i approach this, as someone who has now won a medal? like, man, am i even relevant in this sport anymore?” she pops a piece of gum in her mouth. i wait for her to offer me some, because that’s what you do with gum, but she doesn’t. she’s so in her head. “it’s hard when you’re in the thick of it, you know, to figure out: why the fuck do i keep doing this? when it just breaks my heart over and over and over again?” we pull into her driveway. “i was prepared for the low period after tokyo,” she says. “but this has been much longer and lower than i expected.” the curse of making it to the olympics, let alone coming back with a medal: expectations. molly’s own were high. “i think i thought, after the olympics, if i win a medal, then i will be fixed, it will fix everything.” instead, in a way, it made everything worse. that’s the problem that has plagued molly for most of her running career: her triumphs and troubles intermingle, like thunder and lightning. which, by the way, she has been struck by. (a minor backyard-grill, summer-thunderstorm incident. she was fine.) the next morningin flagstaff, molly’s feeling like she can run a mile, maybe two. it’s snowing, though, and she doesn’t want to risk the slippery track, so we meet at campbell mesa trails. she loops abandaround the back of her truck to stretch and sends me off into the trees to run alone while she does a couple of laps on the street. molly leaves for an acupuncture appointment, and we reunite later at single speed coffee (“the best coffee in flagstaff,” promises the ex-barista who drinks up to three cups a day). we curl up on a couch like it’s her living room, and she talks as freely—and as loudly—as if it was. does she realize everyone can hear her? she doesn’t care. i guess that’s what happens when you’ve grown so comfortable sharing—in therapy, on podcasts, in a three-part video series on adhd for webmd—you just…share. loud and proud. mental illness is so insidious, says molly. “it’s not always this sylvia plath stick-my-head-in-a-fucking-oven thing, where you’re sad all the time,” she says. “high-functioning depressed people live normal successful lives."
"i can be having the happiest moment, and three days later i’m in a total downward spiral.” it’s something you never recover from, she says, but you learn to manage. “i’m this incredibly flawed person who struggles so much. i think: how could i have won this thing when i’m so flawed? i look at all the people around me, all these accomplished people who have their shit together, and i’m like, ‘one of these things is not like the other,’” she says, taking a sip of her flat white. “i was literally in the olympic village thinking: everybody is probably looking at me wondering: why the hell is she here?” they weren’t. they don’t. she knows that. and yet her mind races as fast as she does. it takes up so. much. space. when she’s running, though, the noise disappears. she’s not olympic molly or eating disorder molly, she’s not even, really, runner molly. “when i’m running,” she says, “i’m the most authentic version of myself.” talking helps, too. molly first shared her mental health history a few years ago, “before she was famous,” as she puts it. after the olympics, though, she kept talking and hasn’t stopped. the tokyo games were a turning point, she says. suddenly the most revered athletes in the world were opening up about their mental health. molly credits simone biles’s bravery for her own. if biles, and michael phelps and naomi osaka, could come clean... then maybe a nerdy, niche-y, unlikely medaling marathoner could, too. “those guys got a lot more shit for it than i did,” says molly. “i got off easy. i’m not a household name,” she laughs. she knows she can be candid and off the cuff—and chat freely in a not-empty café—in a way biles never could. “i’m a nobody!” she laughs. still, a nobody with 232,000 instagram followers whom she has touched in very irl ways—becoming an unintentional poster woman for normalizing mental health challenges among athletes. “you are such an incredible inspiration,” @1percentpeterson posts, one comment of a zillion similar. “it’s ok to not be ok!” says another. along with all the online love is, of course, online hate. molly rattles off a few lowlights: “she’s an attention-seeking whore,” “her bones are so brittle she’ll never race again,” “she’s running so badly and posting a lot she should really focus on her running more.” molly finds it curious. “i’m like, ‘if you hate me, you don’t need to follow me, sir.’” it’s molly’s nobody-ness—whatoutsidewriter martin fritz huber called her “runner-next-door” persona, and i’ll just call “genuine personality”—that has made her somebody in running’s otherwise reserved circles. somebody who (gasp!) high-fives her sister in the middle of a major race, as she did at mile 18 of the 2021 new york city marathon. “they shat on me in the broadcast for it,” she says."
"“they were like, ‘she’s not taking this seriously.’” (except, uh, then she set the american course record, so…) somebody who, obviously, swears like a sailor and dances awkwardly on instagram, who dresses up like a turkey, and viral-tweets about getting mansplained on an airplane. (“he starts telling me how i need to train high mileage & pulls up an analysis he’d made of a pro runner’s training on his phone. the pro runner was me. it was my training. didn’t have the heart to tell him.”) somebody who makes every middle-aged mom-runner i know swoon like a swiftie and say: “omg! you hung out with molly seidel!! ?” middle-aged dad-runners, too. “i saw her once in golden gate park!” my friend dan fanboyed when he heard. “i waved!” did she wave back? “she smiled,” he says, “while casually laying down 5:25s.” and somebody who was as outraged as i was that i bought a $16 tube of french toothpaste from my hip flagstaff motel. (it was 10 p.m.! it was all they had!) “for that price it better contain top-shelf cocaine,” she texted. lest letsrun commenters take that tidbit out of context: it’s a joke. it’s, in part, what makes molly america’s most relatable pro runner: she’s not afraid to make jokes. (while we’re at it… don’t knock her for smoking a little legal weed, either. that’s so 2009. per the world anti-doping agency: cannabis is prohibited during competition, not at a christmas party two months before it. per molly: “people would be shocked to know how many pro runners smoke weed.”) i can’t believei never asked to see it. molly’s medal. a real, live olympic medal. maybe because it was tucked into a credenza along with matt’s menorah and her maneki-neko cat figurines from japan. but i think it was because hanging out with molly felt so…normal, i almost forgot she’d won one. people think elite distance runners have to be one-dimensional, she says. that they have to be sculpted, single-minded, running-only robots. “because that’s what the sport has been,” she says. molly falls for it, too, she says. she scrolls the feeds, sees her fellow pros living seemingly perfect lives. she wants everyone to know: she’s not. so much so that she requested we not print the photos originally commissioned for this story, which were taken when she was at the lowest of lows. (“it’s been...refreshing...to be pretty open and real with rachel [about] the challenges of the last year,” she wrote in an email torunner’s worldeditors. “but the photos [were taken at] a time when i was really struggling and actively trying to hide how bad my eating disorder had become.”) molly finds the nyc marathon high-five thing comical but indicative of a more serious issue in elite running: it takes itself too seriously. it’s too…elitist. too stilted. “running a marathon is a pretty freaking cool experience!” if you’re not having fun, she asks rhetorically, what’s the point? still, she admits, she isn’t always having fun. though you wouldn’t know it from her instagram."
"“oh, i’m very good at making it seem like i am,” she says. she used to enjoy social media when it was just her friends. before she gained 50,000 followers in a single day after the trials, and some 70,000 on strava. before the pandemic, before the olympics. keeping up with content became a toxic chore. “you feel like you’re just feeding this beast and it’s never going to stop,” she says. she’s taken to deleting the app off her phone, reloading it only to fulfill contractual agreements and post for her sponsors, then deleting it again. as much as she hates having to post, she enjoys plugging products the only way that feels natural: through parody. as does izzy, her influencer sister, who, like molly, prefers to skewer rather than shill (à la their idea behind their joint insta account: @sadgirltrackclub). “the classic influencer tropes make me want to throw up,” she says (perverse pun as a recovering bulimic not intended). “new gear drop!’ or ‘this is my outfit of the day!’ cringe. “hot girl instagram is not how i identify,” she says. nor is tiktok. “sponsors tell me all the time:you should tiktok!i’m like, ‘i amnotdoing tiktok.’ i know how my brain works. they’ll say, ‘we’ll pay you less if you don’t’—and i’m, like, i don’t care.” and to those sponsors who ghosted her after she returned to eating disorder treatment, good riddance. michelob went silent, she says. “whatever. you have watery-ass beer anyway.” to those who have stood by her, though, she’s utterly devoted. pissed she couldn’t wear the puma panther head to toe in tokyo, molly took off her puma deviate elites and tied them over her shoulder, obscuring the nike logo on her olympic singlet for all the world to see. or not see. “nike isn’t paying my fucking bills.” the love is mutual, says erin longin, a general manager at puma. after decades backing legends like usain bolt, puma was relaunching road running and wanted molly as their guinea pig. “she’s a serious athlete and competitor, but she also has fun with it,” says longin. “running should be fun. molly embodies that.” at their first meeting, in january 2020, molly made them laugh and nerded out over their new shoes. “we all left there, fingers crossed she’d sign with us,” says longin. come february, they all flipped out. longin was watching the trials, not expecting much. and then: “we were all messaging, “omg! !” then molly killed in london. medaled in tokyo. “what she did for us in that first year…” says longin. “we couldn’t have planned it!” then came the second year, and the third, and throughout it all—injuries, eating disorder treatment, missed races, missed opportunities—puma hasn’t flinched. “it’s easy for a company to do the right thing when everything is going great,” molly posted in april, heartbroken from her couch instead of heartbreak hill."
"“but it’s when the sh*t hits the fan and they’re still right there with you….” she received 35,000 hearts—and a call from longin: “you make me feel so proud.” does it matter to puma if molly never places—never races—again? “nope,” longin says. my last afternoonin flagstaff, it’s cloudy skies, still freezing. i find molly on the high school track wearing neoprene gloves, black puffy coat, another pair of pumas. her breath is white, her cheeks red. her legs churning in even, elegant strides. upright, alone, at peace, backed by snow-dusted peaks. running itself is what matters, not racing, she tells me. “i honestly don’t give a shit about winning,” she says. all she wants—really wants, she says—is to be healthy enough to run until she’s old and gray. molly’s favorite runner is one who didn’t get to grow old. who made his mark decades before she was born: steve prefontaine. “pre raced in such a genuine way. he made people feel something,” she says. “the sports performances you truly remember,” she adds, “are the ones where you see the struggle, the work, the realness.” sounds familiar. “i hate conversations like, ‘who’s the goat?’” molly continues. “who fucking cares? who’s got the story that’s going to get people excited? that’s going to make some kid want to go out and do it?” i know one of those kids: my best friend’s daughter, quinn, a rising track phenom in oregon, who has dealt with anxiety and ocd tendencies. she has a picture of molly seidel, and her times, taped to her bedroom wall. this past may, quinn joined nike’s bowerman club. she was named oregon female athlete of the year under 12 by usatf. she wants to run for notre dame. “quinn loves running more than anything,” her mom tells me, texting photos of her elated 11-year-old atop the podium. “but i don’t know…” she’s unsure about setting her daughter on this path. how could she not, though? it’s all quinn wants to do. maybe what quinn, too, feels born to do. it’ll be okay, i tell her, i hope. quinn has something molly never had: she has a molly. molly and i catch up via phone in june. a team of doctors in germany has overhauled her biomechanics. she’s been running 110 miles a week, feeling healthy, hopeful. happy. a month later, severe anemia (and accompanying iron infusions) interrupts her summer racing schedule. she cancels the couple of 10ks she had planned and entertains herself by popping into the utmb speedgoat mountain race: a 28k trail run through utah’s little cottonwood canyon—coming in second with a 3:49:58. molly’s focus is on the chicago marathon, october 8th; her first major race in almost two years. does it matter how she does? does it matter if she slays the olympic trials in february? if she makes it to paris 2024? if she fulfills her childhood dream and brings homegold? nah. not if—like matt, like puma, like, finally, even molly herself—you see molly the runner for who she really is: molly the mere mortal."
"she’s the imperfect one who puts it perfectly: what matters isn’t her time or place, how she performs on the pavement. or social media posts. what matters—as a professional athlete, as a person—is how she makes people feel: human. rachel levinis a journalist and author oflook big: and other tips for surviving animal encounters of all kinds, and co-author of the cookbookseat something: a wise sons cookbook for jews who like food and food lovers who like jews, andsteamed: a cathartic cookbook for getting dinner and your feelings on the table. her first kids bookwho ate what?was published in april. the short creek running club running with ms how far can running take a person after addiction? how it felt to set a world record in running 2023 rw runners of the year hector espinal: building relationships and creatin aum gandhi makes every mile count mary cain: rethinking the youth sports model verna volker: finding sisterhood victoria lo: supporting aapi communities katelyn hutchison: breaking barriers andrea lytle peet: racing against als a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"we put the best to the test to find the right fit, sound, and sweat-resistance for runners. we earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.why trust us? headphones have become just as essential in the runner’s toolkit asrunning shoes, afitness tracker, or asmartwatch. for the most part, runners looking for headphones generally choose in-ear models, including truly wireless earbuds and neckband earbuds with a wire or band connecting them. they stay in place far better than over-ear headphones, and often have features made with exercise in mind, like ear hooks and sweat-resistant materials. these are the best running headphones we here atrunner’s worldhave tried—buds we’ve worn well-past testing on all kinds of runs, including marathons. runner’s worldeditors have been testing gear tirelessly for over 50 years. that means a lot of miles in a lot of shoes—mid-run music has become a godsend for plenty of us as we tap out our favorite loops day after day. in short, we review products with a focus on finding the best tech for avid runners. every pair of earbuds we test meets the same criteria before it ends up in one of our reviews. we’re not just throwing airpods on this list because everyone has them, for example—we eschewed including the latest version because we like thesecond pro generationmore for their snug fit. in a similar fashion, all the other buds we recommend here are here because we’ve run with them, sweat all over them, toyed with their fit, and ultimately enjoyed them. nobody else contributes to our decision-making process, especially not the brands we’ve picked. therunner’s worldtest team is constantly listening to music, podcasts, you name it, as we try running shoes,shorts, and everything else. our team loves music; we evenconducted a test on whether a song’s beat can influence your running pace. our watches and smartphones haverunning playlists for every kind of runwith music. we also play podcasts and audiobooks to test different kinds of sound quality—and catch up on true crime or “read” celebrity memoirs. besides downloading a range of genres to listen to, we also evaluate fit, sound quality, and battery life as we test earbuds and comb testers’ feedback to determine the best headphones for this list. our testers log long runs—and marathons and ultramarathons—wearing their earbuds and taking note of how many times they have to charge them per week. we also test sweat-resistance and comfort after prolonged in-ear use, putting in hours of running through all kinds of weather to also gauge water- and wind-resistance. for waterproof models, we plop them in a cup full of water to check if they’re still in working order (and so you can squash those fears of replacing your buds after an accidental puddle drop or spin cycle). the earbuds on this list checked off most or all of the above characteristics. become a runner’s world+ member for exclusive access to product testing opportunities!"
"the main draw of bone-conduction headphones is safety—because they project soundwaves directly through your skull into your eardrums, they don’t need to plug your ears, which leaves them open to take in all the ambient sound around you. in other words, the open-ear design allows runners to listen to their playlists while also being aware of their surroundings, such as traffic. shokz is the most recognizable bone conduction headphone brand with good reason. even though the sound quality isn’t as crisp as that of in-ear earbuds, the shokz headphones have the brand’s turbopitch feature, which we’ve found boosts the bass enough to offset the tinniness that you sometimes get with earbuds that allow too much airflow. the headset is lightweight—only 1 ounce— and requires only an hour-long charge for 10 hours of battery life. another plus is the comfort factor— the open-ear ’phones won’t cause skin irritation after prolonged use. fair warning: if you have piercings around the helix or conch of your ear, you might experience some discomfort in these headphones, because the main pads that compress your head sit right behind your ears. it’s initially a weird sensation regardless, but the potential pain from contact with these piercings could be a dealbreaker. if we had to pick a single set of running headphones from apple, we’d grab the beats fit pro. they take everything we love in theairpods 3andbeats studio buds, and they cram it all into a tiny set of buds with ear wings to help them stay put. no matter how sweaty we got during testing, these didn’t budge. they also didn’t ache when we got up to an hour or 90 minutes of running, which is roughly when the discomfort of ill-fitting buds starts to snowball. we enjoyed these earbuds’ delightful tactile buttons. they require just a light press to play/pause, two presses to skip, three to go back, and a long press to activate active noise cancelation and transparency modes or siri. it’s easy to use, and there’s no fumbling for small buttons. the coolest feature, however, is one you might have never considered—spatial audio. when you turn your head, the audio rotates so it sounds like the music is still coming from the same direction, just as the sound would change when you swivel your head at a real concert. it’s trippy at first, but you won’t actually trip while you’re running—we got used to the feature quickly. but it’s not just neat audio effects at play here—the sound is remarkable for small headphones. thanks to an h2 chip and amplifier, the second generation of the airpod pro has noticeably deeper bass and clearer, louder sound than the original. plus, you can customize the spatial audio—by taking photos of your head and ears—so the sound is tailored to how you would naturally hear. it’s a neat trick— swivel your head and the focal point shifts. it’s like you’re actually in a room with live music. other improvements make these great for your daily workouts."
"transparency mode, in particular, works far better with less of the digital crackle you get when wind passes over the microphones that pump in external audio. to be fair, we’ve found there’s still some wind noise, but you completely forget about it after the first quarter mile or so of your run. plus, there’s none of the “thump, thump” you get from other sealed earbuds every time your foot hits the ground. at this point, we ought to acknowledge that there is a third generation of the standard airpods out, but we still rank the pro 2 buds higher because of their superior in-ear security—the 3s don’t have rubber ear tips and simply can’t handle the same repeated shocks. read full review director of product contentwill egensteinersaid these buds’ lack of ear wings initially made them feel insecure, but they stayed put nicely during runs without generating a noticeable “thud” at each foot strike. however, working up a sweat caused a slight rubbing noise where the silicone tip sealed in the ear. that seal wasn’t so tight as to prevent him from hearing his surroundings—a plus for outdoor running. but because of that, the sound wasn’t as immersive, and the battery life wasn’t on par with that of the other models. but it’s tough to argue with inexpensive, truly wireless earbuds that offer modest water-resistance, quick and easy pairing, a charging case, and a built-in microphone to take phone calls—plus a full two-year warranty. test editoramanda furrerhas long rocked the (now-discontinued) jabra elite 75t—they’re still going strong even after she accidentally ran them through her washing machine—and has found these to be a familiar, yet improved, replacement. the elite 8 active, touted as “the world’s toughest earbuds,” passed nine durability tests that met u.s. military standards for rugged electronics, according to jabra. at a demo in new york, furrer was told to plop them into an 8-ounce glass of water before popping them back into her ears. the elite 8 active can be submerged down to 5 feet. you can’t listen to music during a swim because bluetooth does not work well underwater, but you can rest assured the earbuds will continue to work properly after being dropped in a rain puddle. sticky silicone “shakegrip” keeps these locked in your ear canal no matter how sweaty you get, without the need for hooks or wings. the earbuds have six microphones, which are great for phone calls, but also power the active noise cancelation and transparency features. the elite 8 active’s standout feature, however, is dolby audio. spatial and 6mm speakers provide a more nuanced sound experience as you run. think of it as having a mini music hall by each ear. it was tester kendra petruny’s first time running with open-ear earbuds when we gave her 1more’s s50 to test. she usually wears apple airpods on her runs, but checked to see if the s50 would fall out when she cartwheeled (they stayed put). the ultimate test, however, was wearing them while racing a half marathon."
"petruny was happy to report the s50 didn’t budge. the volume could have been a little louder, she said. however, she appreciated how the open-ear style allowed her to hear the crowds’ cheers as she ran. the buds have an impressive ipx7 rating, meaning the electronics shouldn’t be affected by a heavy downpour or your sweat. the battery life is also good for up to 11 hours on a single charge, making this pair ideal for ultras. one problem with plenty of dedicated running earbuds is one you can see from a mile away: they tend to be bulky, especially if they have ear hooks. if that’s not your style, or you want buds that will play nice with a wider variety of headwear, we recommend looking for options that sit more flush with your ear. enter the jaybird vista 2 earbuds. not only do these earbuds barely stick out of your ears, but they also come in an exceptionally tidy carrying case that’s easy to stow away on long runs if you want to charge them or take a break from your tunes. the vista 2 lasts eight hours on a single charge—long enough to get you to the finish line of your next 26.2—and two hours longer than the original vista. plus, you’ll get an additional 16 hours with the charging case. this update preserves the same earbud shape, with a secure fit that seals out dust and moisture. speaking of moisture, the sweat- and waterproof vista 2 improves to a rating of ip68 from the first version’s ip67. double-tap (don’t press) to change between active noise canceling (anc) and surroundsense (ambient noise pass-through) modes. though our best overall pick, theshokz openrun pro, uses a wraparound band to hold itself in place on your head, the majority of other headphones use two systems to stay in place: in-ear tips and external ear hooks. in the best case, both are an effective means of keeping your buds in or on your ears during a turbulent run, but plenty of runners have a strong preference for one or the other. let us spell out some key differences for you. these buds have neither connecting wires nor hooks that extend around your ear; you just push them in and go. this design tends to fit snug in the ear canal to stop it from loosening midrun. the compact style makes them lightweight, and their small batteries can mean more frequent charging. however, all of our test models came with charging cases that allow you to juice them up on the go. truly wireless earbuds also tend to be the most expensive. over-ear hooks take some pressure off the ear canal to hold these buds steady. adding a hook can improve an earbud’s fit, too, since there’s a second point of contact to hold it in place. the hook can also store antennae or a battery, helping these buds play longer than their truly wireless counterparts. they’re often marginally cheaper than truly wireless models, but some will cost more than $200 anyway."
"the best running headphones will fit comfortably, so you can think about your run and not your aching ears. that fit also affects how much outside sound is let in—there’s no ideal balance for everybody. some runners like buds that fit deep in their ears and block all outside noise, allowing them to crank up the tunes, while others prefer lots of environmental sound from a looser fit. the latter fit is safer for running outside and among other people. because earbuds that isolate you from the outside world should provide clear sound, we expected better sound quality from earbuds that fit snug in the ear than we did from earbuds that let in a lot of noise. it’s becoming more common, however, for the best running headphones to offer an ambient sound mode, which uses the earbud’s microphone to bring in outside noise while maintaining a tight fit. while we test each pair of running earbuds for at least two weeks—some far longer—we don’t typically encounter quality issues. but we ask our testers to discuss how the earbuds felt—you’d expect a $200 set of buds to feel premium compared to a $40 pair. for long-term quality assessment, we checked user reviews from amazon and other retailers to identify any persistent issues. plus, we update our findings here if any issues crop up as we continue to run with these models. none of our testers had issues with water or sweat ruining their buds, but with long-term use, moisture and salt can destroy earbuds that aren’t capable of repelling it. so, we factored in each device’s ip, oringress protection, rating. the rating consists of two numbers. we also ask testers to evaluate how quickly and easily the buds connected to their phones, and how far they were able to get from their phones before the signal cut out. in addition, we recorded any mid-run connectivity issues. to assess battery life, we checked manufacturers’ claims against our testers’ experiences and noted discrepancies where they occurred. we’ll continually update this roundup with our test impressions of the best earbuds for running. tell us what you think about your buds in the comments. how do you listen to music and run phone-free? as a loyal garmin user, i recommend using models like theforerunner 245 musicor theforerunner 965, which i’m currently wearing. the latter has more features if you’re a multi-sport, stats-junkie, but the price is significantly higher. the watches allow you to sync with music providers, such as spotify. most earbuds, with the exception of apple airpods, aregarmin compatible. how do you pair wireless earbuds to your garmin? fellow test editor morgan petruny offersa helpful guide on pairing your earbuds to devices. here’s her instructions on pairing them to you garmin: how do you clean earbuds? for a deep clean, fill a glass with a drop of dish soap in half a cup of warm water. remove the foam or silicone tips from the earbuds, and let them soak in the soap mixture for 30 minutes."

"wesley swainston connects pup-lovers across the country with their new best friend. around 5:30 p.m., after wesley swainston finishes his work with the marine corps, he heads toadoption first animal rescue, a shelter in jacksonville, north carolina. after spending the majority of his day managing aircrafts in the sky as an air traffic control officer, swainston volunteers as a trainer helping rescue dogs improve their chances of getting adopted. with a leash in hand, swainston heads to the kennels and picks out adogto run with. some dogs are full of energy while others are more timid and need encouragement to get out the door. some can run for the entire 1-mile loop around the shelter, and others will only make it halfway. but no matter the distance, the dogs always finish the run happier. for the past year, swainston has shared these miles on social media in hopes of getting more dogs adopted, and the effort is paying off. since the secondvideo went viralin march—a point-of-view reel that shows swainston running with rescue dogs cindy, rooster, and hondooo while sharing training tips and the personality traits of each animal—most of the dogs he’s featured on instagram have found new homes. “there’s a lot of good that comes out of [running with shelter dogs],” swainston tellsrunner’s world. “being able to connect with a dog is just a lot easier when you prioritize their physical exercise before coming in there and asking them to sit and stay and all of the commands that owners are looking for when adopting a dog.” five years ago, swainston started running to get himself in shape for training in the marine corps, which requires recruits to pass aninitial strength testthat includes running 1.5 miles in 13:30 or less (9:00-mile pace). now an active duty marine for the last four years, swainston kept running because he appreciates how the sport makes him “stronger mentally.” so far, he’s competed in five marathons and ultramarathons. about a year ago, the jacksonville resident, who also works as a part-time dog trainer, decided to combine his passion for running with his love forcanines. he quickly learned the animals were calmer and happier if they exercised prior to training. “the benefits to running with your dog are immense—the bond, getting their exercise out so they’re more able to work with you, especially in the chaotic shelter environment,” he says. in november 2023, swainston posted a video on instagram of him running with shelter dogs that were being overlooked at the rescue center. by describing each animal and the techniques he uses to connect with them individually—exercise, quality time, and treats, for example—swainston hopes to “show people what the dog could be,” he says. late last year, swainston was deployed to norway and wasn’t able to continue working at the shelter while overseas, but he picked it up again once he returned home in the spring. after the video in march gained a lot of attention online, swainston created a separate instagram account dedicated to his runs called@runningwithshelterdogs."
"through the platform, swainston has connected with people around the country who are interested in adoption, often pairing them with dogs that have a tougher time finding homes. earlier this month, he partnered with wheelchair athletejesi stachamto help raise awareness for crispy, a dog who came to the shelter with her two back legs paralyzed. crispy was later adopted after thevideowas posted. swainston has also encouragedother runners to start volunteeringat their own local shelters. along with getting more dogs adopted, his ultimate goal is to create an in-person and virtual community of people giving their time to animals in need. and he’s not slowing down any time soon. later this month, swainston plans to run a full marathon with 26 dogs (one mile with each dog) at adoption first. “there’s no cooler feeling than posting a video and because of that video, a dog gets its forever home,” swainston said. taylor dutch is a writer and editor living in austin, texas, and a former ncaa track athlete who specializes in fitness, wellness, and endurance sports coverage. her work has appeared in runner’s world, self, bicycling, outside, and podium runner. trials champion nikki hiltz joins grand slam track dear god, don't run during a friggin' hurricane matthew centrowitz runs 2:24:36 at chicago susanna sullivan leads american women at chicago top american men at 2024 chicago marathon ruth chepngetich shatters world record at chicago john korir wins the men's race at chicago keira d’amato drops out of the chicago marathon results from the 2024 chicago marathon chicago marathon allows florida runners to defer tim walz appears at twin cities marathon keira d’amato has an olympic champion pacer a part of hearst digital media we may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 hearst magazines, inc. all rights reserved."
"nedd brockmann’s 1,000-mile (1,609km) charity run has been dubbed “australian of the year type shit” by dylan alcott, the wheelchair tennis star who won the award in 2022, after the runner completed his challenge at 6.17am on wednesday. alcott’s message of support to brockmann is one of dozens from australia’s athletic and celebrity elite celebrating the end of his arduous near-two-week run in which he averaged 128km per day around an athletics track at sydney olympic park. the 25-year-old hasraised more than $2.6m for australians experiencing homelessness, although his time could not beat the 1988 world record set by greek ultra runner yiannis kourous of just under 10 and a half days. brockmann finished his run in 12 days, 13 hours, 16 minutes and 45 seconds – around half a day behind bryan smith’s australian record set at the 1998 nanango 1000 mile track race – and burst into tears after crossing the finish line. the epic run was live streamed on tiktok as “nedd brockmann’s uncomfortable challenge” and viewed more than 4.7 million times across 50 countries, while as many as 2,000 people gathered to watch his final night of running from the grandstand at the athletics track. afterwards, brockmann revealed a left shin injury in august hampered his preparation, and rain on day two triggered damage to his feet. “from then, just trying to get up in the morning, ripped so bad – my toes looked like king charles’ fingers,” he said. an injury to his right shin on day three, as well as subsequent problems with his left shin and right knee made running almost impossible, and brockmann had to take injections to reduce swelling. “from day five onwards it was a downwards spiral, trying to just hold on,” he said. television presenter hamish blake said on instagram: “it started as a world record about time. it grew into the world championships of never giving up. and nedd, you finished undisputed.” surfer mick fanning said brockmann’s achievement brought a tear to his eye. “you’re a selfless man. inspiring, courageous and real. utmost respect,” he said. and alcott added: “australian of the year type shit. give the man what he deserves. unbelievable effort brother.” swimmer shayna jack, afl player jeremy cameron, and wallaby taniela tupou all expressed their admiration for the electrician from western nsw, in response to a video posted on instagram after brockmann finished which has been liked more than 180,000 times. sign up toaustralia sport get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our australian sports desk after newsletter promotion this article includes content provided by instagram. we ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. to view this content,click 'allow and continue'. brockmann has had to endure substantial discomfortduring the event, and had to be ferried to and from the track in a wheelchair. he would barely sleep a few hours each day due to his schedule and the pain in his legs."
"his feet swelled three shoe sizes and he developed severe blisters due to the grip of the track and the sheer load of the run, significantly more than the 100km per day he covered in his 2022 run from perth to sydney. vice president of the australian ultra and trail runners association, corrina black, said brockmann’s run highlighted that ultra running can be for anyone, and he has showed grit and tenacity. “it’s opened up the doors and highlighted that anyone can be an ultra runner and just need to put one foot in front of the other,” black said. “if you can use your running at the same time to motivate others and to raise money for charity, it’s a win all round, isn’t it?” brockmann earlier raised $1.85m forwe are mobilise, an outreach program combatting homelessness, with a 46-day run of 4,000km across australia in 2022."

"dauwalter does not have a coach, a strict training plan or a strava account, but the 38-year-old is widely considered ultrarunning’s greatest of all time in 2023, courtneydauwalter became the first person, male or female, to win the triple crown, the three most iconic 100-mile races in the world, in a single season. ultrarunning, with races ranging from 50km to 250 miles, is defined by type-a personalities: meticulous, rigid, detail-oriented, even obsessed. courtney dauwalter, 38, is the exception to the rule. dauwalter does not have a coach or a strict training plan. she’s never been on strava and doesn’t plan races far ahead of time. she runs in long shorts and baggy clothes because, she says, they are more comfortable. she eats candy while training and drinks beer afterwards, because that’s what makes her the most happy. “my diet is to eat the things that look good in quantities that feel good,” said dauwalter. “my fuel tank is based on joy. if i’m happy, the engine works way better.” while her philosophy may sound casual, the results say otherwise. in the last decade, dauwalter has won more than 50 ultras, often in dominant fashion, and is widely considered the greatest of all time. over the summer of 2023, dauwalter became the first person, male or female, to win the triple crown in the same season. the triple consists of western states 100, hardrock 100, and utmb, three of the most grueling, competitive and iconic ultras in the world. only one other athlete, kilian jornet, has won all three in the span of an entire career. yet, despite a barrage of accolades, dauwalter says winning the triple crown didn’t change her outlook at all. “i don’t think of it as an inflection point. i don’t think about any of my wins that way. no race is perfect. there is always something to do differently next time. i always hope to finish a race knowing i gave everything i had that day, but be able to tinker. i’m motivated by the puzzle.” the puzzle, so to speak, is her secret to success. like most highly successful people, dauwalter is motivated by the process, not the results. however, her process is anything but traditional. “after i wake up, i have two cups of coffee and go through an informal full body assessment,” dauwalter explains. “where’s my head? how are my feet? how are my lungs and what is my stress level? i listen to what my systems are saying, before i do anything else.” without a coach or set training plan, dauwalter trains entirely on feel. her days are structured loosely, which allows for adaptability. she makes decisions intuitively, like how many hill repeats to run or how big her loop should be that day. “after checking in, i make an idea of what workout i’m going to do. as i head out on my run, i keep doing the system checks to see how i’m feeling as i start moving."
"if i feel good i may hit the gas pedal, if i don’t i might hit the brakes.” dauwalter started this year with a win at transgrancanaria 126k in february and followed it with a win at mount fuji 100 in april. in july she won hardrock for the third year in a row, but claims that none of these races were as easy as she would have liked. “after last summer i was more tired than i’ve ever been, so i took a lot more time off than usual. i usually take about a month, but i took a lot of months to chill,” says dauwalter. “i was exhausted physically and mentally.” the longer break meant she lost more fitness, which made her return more challenging. “i ran transgrancanaria in 2023, so it was easy to compare the two races. it was a lot harder this time,” says dauwalter, despite winning by more than an hour. after winning mount fuji, dauwalter felt like she was back on track. “training was going well and i felt good going into the race, but hardrock was one of those days that the gears didn’t line up. in the first few hours i knew it wasn’t going to be smooth. everything took a little more effort than it should have, so i just kept reminding myself to be patient and to let time be our friend.” still, dauwalter broke her own course record by two and a half minutes. she hopes to race again this fall, but doesn’t know which race it will be. “i’m just enjoying as much as possible right now, not thinking about what comes next. instead of trying to predict the next chapter, i just want to live in this one.” this wasn’t always dauwalter’s philosophy. she had never heard about ultrarunning – let alone thought about being a professional – until she was in her twenties. “growing up you see this progression in front of you. you play the board game of life and learn you’re supposed to follow the steps,” says dauwalter. “i believed in a linear path. choosing ultrarunning was like turning onto a side road. that’s when i realized i was writing my own book.” in 2017 she left her full-time teaching job to take a chance on ultrarunning. “it was just a hobby so choosing it full-time was kinda crazy. i didn’t have a way to help pay for bills at the house, but i didn’t want to be 90 and wonder ‘what if?’” this type of curiosity was formed as a kid. growing up in the suburbs outside minneapolis, dauwalter was part of a close-knit, active and hard-working family. “the grades were always less important than if we tried our hardest,” dauwalter says. “my parents emphasized that if we were going to do something, we should give it everything we had.” as the middle child, dauwalter was close with both of her brothers. “we went to the same school, through the same phases, and even shared a car together,” dauwalter jokes."
"“we all played on the same soccer team and they didn’t treat me differently because i was a girl. they never lowered the bar for me.” in seventh grade dauwalter joined the cross-country team, which quickly became her biggest passion. in her first year she made the varsity team and qualified for the state meet. “we had amazing coaches all the way through high school. the guys and girls teams trained together, like a family of best friends.” dauwalter’s coaches fostered a culture around working hard, but not at the sacrifice of fun. “i remember belly laughing while doing hill repeats. they encouraged us to not lose sight of the goal, while having fun.” this mentality made a big impression on dauwalter and has become one of her core ethos. even when deep into a 100-mile race, dauwalter is known for her big smile and an infectious sense of joy. after graduating college, dauwalter signed up for her first marathon, not expecting it to go well. “i thought 26 miles would kill me, but it didn’t, so i started to wonder how much longer i could go?” curiosity led her to ultrarunning, but success didn’t come immediately. in 2012, dauwalter dropped out of her first 100-mile race, which initially made her doubt herself. “i remember thinking i was a joke for trying it, but that moment was a key part of my path. it taught me about the mental side of ultrarunning and how important the things you tell yourself are, especially in the hardest moments.” years later, dauwalter’s mental fortitude is what truly sets her apart. she cherishes visits to what she calls “the pain cave”, the mental place she goes when she reaches her physical limit. she visualizes an actual cave, walks in, picks up a chisel, and starts chipping away. if needed, she’ll stay in the cave for hours. “going into the cave is my whole purpose of signing up for a race. i don’t go there in training, so i feel lucky to visit in a race,” says dauwalter. “on the start line, i want to get into that cave as quickly as i can and spend as much time as i can, making it bigger.” dauwalter sees the same cave every time, returning to the exact spot she left off and keeps chipping away. visiting the cave is a tool to keep moving forward and believing in herself, not a distraction. by focusing on swinging the chisel again and again, dauwalter sends signals to her legs to keep going. although unintentional, the pain cave is a near perfect allegory for the process of ultrarunning. it’s a craft that takes years of dedication and consistency to master, just like digging a huge cave. while the pain cave may sound dark and grueling, dauwalter says it’s better framed as curiosity. “it’s impossible to do a 100-mile race perfectly, with so many variables and so much time at play. there is always something to learn, if i stay curious and keep moving the puzzle pieces around. i love that feeling."
i love that i get to keep figuring it out.”
"experts say best form of recovery will be to stay active, process traumas and set healthy targets most people would consider running a marathon the pinnacle of fitness – but not russ cook. the endurance athlete hasjust completeda 9,940-mile (16,000km) run along the entire length of africa. while cook told reporters that he was a “little bit tired” and in need of a strawberry daiquiri after completing his odyssey, scientists who spoke to the guardian suggested the road to recovery could be rockier than he anticipates. there will be some positive impacts on his health, such as increased cardiorespiratory fitness, more efficient delivery of oxygen to the muscles and better energy efficiency. but dr dan gordon, an associate professor in cardiorespiratory exercise physiology at anglia ruskin university, warned that cook could also expect an amplified version of what regular marathon runners experience up to 120 hours post-race: extreme tiredness, muscle soreness, joint aches and potential skin sores from sweating and clothes rubbing. he added that given the heat during cook’s run, acute kidney issues were likely due to dehydration. cook’s immune system will also be weakened as although some exercise gives it a boost, too much with insufficient recovery increases the risk of catching colds and flu. “as he recovers, this immune suppression will dissipate, but it is a relatively slow process,” gordon said. the best form of recovery will be to stay active, with cycling and swimming, both good lower-impact forms of exercise, as well as stretching his muscles and sports therapy to recover the range of motion in areas not used in running that will have declined to compensate, gordon said. whether such ultra runs are a good idea was primarily a “philosophical question”, he said. “the human machine can do remarkable things and is also incredibly resilient. we know that as long as the pace per day is not excessive, this is achievable.” he suggested the psychological impact could be most severe, including the comedown from the exhilaration and adrenaline in the first 24-48 hours after finishing the race, and the psychological strain of a lonely experience. martin turner, a sports psychologist at manchester metropolitan university, said cook would benefit from psychological support to help him process the traumatic aspects of the experience, such as being robbed at gunpoint, and to help him set healthy new goals, such as using his expertise to help others. “humans have a tendency to hit highs and believe ‘ok, now i’m satisfied,’ but that’s not what humans are like, we’re always looking for the next thing,” he said. “we’re naturally predisposed to setting goals and pursuing them. my question would be: is he looking for something else? potentially he’ll try to do more and bigger.” he said the key signs that fixating on exercise goals is becoming a problem were exercising through pain, injury and illness – as was the case for cook."
"indeed, many elite athletes struggle to set realistic exercise goals, he noted, and exhibit emotionally unhealthy behaviours, such as feeling frustrated when they can’t train “because you don’t want to do anything else”. cook’s “hardest geezer” moniker could also suggest he may have wrapped his identity and sense of self up too closely with running, which turner said could create a dependency on training. “it’s ok wanting to do things, ‘i want to push myself, meet these goals’, but when you spill over into ‘i have to do it, i have to succeed’, that’s quite unhealthy pressure. you suffer and sacrifice a lot.” dan lieberman, a harvard professor and author of exercised, said that although humans had evolved to run long distances, “we never evolved to run marathons, ultramarathons, or even insanely crazy distances like the length of africa”. he said it “always raises concerns” when people pushed the human body way beyond what we evolved to do, though because there are so few examples of this, there is limited data around serious long-term consequences. onerecent research paperlooked at the hearts of runners who ran a marathon a day across the uk and only found evidence of damage in two smokers. most casual runners need not fear. lieberman added: “we have a lot of data on how running is a phenomenal form of vigorous physical activity that has lifelong benefits. and the good news is you don’t have to run marathons to get the full benefits.”"
"endurance athlete from worthing says he is ‘just trying to soak it all in’ after completing 352-day, 9,940-mile run after sinking a strawberry daiquiri and a few beers and enjoying a reunion with his girlfriend after more than a year apart, russ cook, aka the “hardest geezer”, who completed his 9,940-mile (16,000km) run along theentire length of africaon sunday, woke up feeling “a little bit frosty, a little bit tired”. and for once, the 27-year-old endurance athlete from worthing, west sussex, who raised more than £700,000 for charity on his epic journey, was not pulling on his running shoes. it was all “quite, quite overwhelming”, he said. “just trying to soak it all in really, trying to enjoy it, and the thought of not running today is a bit of a mad one. it is very, very strange,” he told itv’s good morning britain (gmb) live from tunisia, where he crossed the finish line on sunday afternoon after running for 352 days through 16 countries. “i think my body said ‘finally, nice one mate, chill out a minute’. need to get some stretching done, maybe today, but yeah, no running. unbelievable.” cook’s challenge, to become the first to run the entire length ofafrica, began on 22 april 2023 at south africa’s most southerly tip, cape agulhas, and ended at tunisia’s most northerly point, ras angela. it captured the imagination of the public, with his social media posts amassing millions of views. some doubt has been cast on whether he is actually the first to run the length of continent, with the dispute appearing to centre on what technically constitutes the length of africa. the world runners association, a group of nine athletes who have successfully circumnavigated the globe on foot, claimed one of its members, jesper kenn olsen from denmark, was the first person to run the length of africa, during his “world run” challenge in which he ran across several continents. olsen is said to have begun his challenge on 28 december 2008 in taba, egypt, and run 7,948 miles to the cape of good hope in south africa, completing his journey in 2010. “mr olsen ran through egypt, sudan, ethiopia, kenya, tanzania, mozambique, swaziland and south africa. he hereby fulfilled the criteria for a full-length run across africa,” said phil essam, the president of the wra. cook’s significantly longer route was from south to north and along the west coast, and not as the crow flies. he seemed unfazed, telling gmb: “i haven’t heard anything about it, to be fair. but there’s plenty of people before me that have done lots of big runs and kudos to all of them because they are big challenges. so nothing but respect, really.” cook faced several setbacks during his journey through rainforests, over mountain ranges and across the sahara to raise money forthe running charity, which provides running and mental health programmes for young people experiencing homelessness and complex needs, andsandblast, which promotes awareness of the saharawi people."
"he was robbed at gunpoint in angola, held by men with machetes in the republic of the congo, and had health scares and visa complications. but there was never a moment he thought of giving up. “no, i always knew it was inevitable, just need to keep plugging away one step at a time and eventually it would get done,” he said. he now plans a haircut and beard trim – “we’re looking a bit wild these days” – and will enjoy some time with his girlfriend, emily bell, who told gmb: “it’s been scary, terrifying at times.” cook said of seeing her: “it was crazy, the first time we have seen each other in 14 months. so i can’t really put into words how much that moment meant. but it’s beautiful to have a little bit of time with her.” speaking of the time he was most frightened, cook said it had been when he went missing and was separated from his supporters for days in the jungle, but was eventually freed after villagers armed with machetes were paid off. “the scariest moment was in the congo, when i was on the back of a motorbike, thinking i was about to die, getting driven into the jungle. that was pretty nuts,” he told reporters in tunisia. “probably for about one minute i thought about quitting, and then i realised i couldn’t, so that was about as close as it got.” of his challenge overall he said: “i knew it was going to be hard but i knew i was also going into the unknown, so i had no idea really of how hard it was going to be.”"
"the british ultrarunner jasmin paris has become the first woman ever to finish the notorious barkley marathons race in tennessee. the 40-year-old was one of five runners to complete this year’s event, which is made up of five punishing 20-mile loops around frozen head state park in the east of the us state. paris’s finishing time was 59 hours, 58 minutes and 21 seconds – 99 seconds inside the 60-hour cut-off. paris made headlines in the uk in 2019 by winningthe montane spine racealong the pennine way, breaking the course record for the mixed-sex event by 12 hours. she made more history in the us on friday, adding her name to a list of 20 competitors to have completed the event since it was extended to 100 miles in 1989. ihor verys recorded the fastest time at this year’s event, with the canada-based ukrainian runner finishing in 58hrs 44min 59sec. americans john kelly and jared campbell also completed the race for the third and fourth time respectively, with new zealand’s greig hamilton also beating the cut-off time. in a sporting gesture, campbell alsoappeared to offer paris the choiceto take on the final loop in the clockwise direction – which is considered slightly less difficult – as the remaining competitors camped out before the closing stage. the runners on the final loop must alternate between clockwise and anticlockwise, so that they are not running together. the finishers.#bm100pic.twitter.com/jimcgzd5nb paris, who has two children and works as a vet and research scientist in edinburgh, first competed in the barkley marathons in 2022, where she finished three loops. in last year’s race, she completed a fourth loop but was outside the time limit. known as “the race that eats its young”, the barkley marathons is considered to beone of the toughest ultramarathons in the world. while the woodland route changes year to year, it is estimated to feature an accumulated 16,500m (54,000 feet) of elevation changes. sign up tothe recap the best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion the race was created by renowned course designer gary cantrell, better known as “lazarus lake”, and first run over 50 miles in 1986; cantrell lights a ceremonial cigarette to mark the start of each year’s run. the unusual event also features a bugler, who plays to signal when a runner has dropped out."
"the ultrarunner is famed for her achievements in long-distance events. breaking 11 world records in a single competition may be her finest feat to date it’s a hot winter noon on a monday and camille herron is asleep. she lies on a cot in a tent next to a flat dirt track. lined with palm trees and white stone and desert grass, it loops two and a half miles along the lip of a large olive-green lake. over the lake, towers a screen of steep mountains covered in bush scrub. it’s one resort among many in california’s coachella valley and the setting for lululemon’s further event, a chance for 10 select women to run as far as they can in six days. it’s the penultimate day, and her nap is stretching long – five hours – and the timer by the line is ticking – and herron has less than 24 hours to run 48 miles. if she can will herself on, she’ll break a record that has stood for more than three decades. once the gold standard of what human beings could endure on foot, the six-day race predates both trail races and the modern marathon. in the 19th century, thousands of spectators lined up to watch these “pedestrians” walk six days – in the empire skating rink at pt barnum’s hippodrome, where the met life building now stands in lower manhattan, and in fairs across the united states. popular in europe and america, they brought bettors and challengers and diversity. the first women’s six-day race took place in chicago in 1876. according to davy crockett of theultrarunninghistory website, “more than 300 women” competed in these near week-long events in the 19th century. in 1880 a haitian immigrant, frank hart, “wowed audiences at new york’s madison square garden” by completing 565 miles in six days. he came away with $21,567, about $679,000 in today’s money. then came accusations ofcheating, poisonings, the rise of the bicycle, and the final death blow, baseball. the 1980s saw a resurgence of the timed-format ultramarathons and the men’s six-day record was broken for the first time in a century. but it seemed a high-water mark had been reached. no one had come close to yiannis kouros’s 645 miles in 1988 and sandy barwick’s 549 in 1990, the men’s and women’s records respectively. “their records have proven utterly resistant to successors,” says former trans-america race director jesse riley. then in 2015, a lanky 5ft 9in runner from norman, oklahoma appeared on the ultramarathon scene. with an awkward gait, a wide smile, and an eccentric personality, herron, a 2:37 marathoner, started an unprecedented streak. in 2017, she became the third american to win the comrades marathon, a storied 55-mile race in south africa, and in 2023 won the spartathalon, a 153-mile ultramarathon in greece. she is the first athlete, male or female, to win both. that same year, she logged 270 miles around a 400m track in bruce, australia."
"she did so in 48 hours not only improving her own mark but becoming the first woman to hold an outright american record – for men and women – in distance running. when the further event started last wednesday, herron was already the holder of multiple world records from 50 to 250 miles. a small crowd gathered under four towers of stage lights and rows of orange and white tents. the 42-year-old was in shades, a water bottle stuffed in the crotch of her shorts. on day one, she chugged a coke float and ran 133 miles. day two, she downed tacos and added another 113 miles. on 8 march international women’s day, she broke the american 48-hour road record for women. more would follow. each time herron broke a record, she held her arms out wide, her hands pointing to the sky as if to say, “isn’t this incredible?” the fact that she is openly awed by what she does has at times made her a target in the ultrarunning community. her whimsical pre-race mantra of “letting the magic come out” only adds to that. but it’s hard to argue with the numbers. and the numbers and records were piling up: a new 300km mark, the american 48-hour road record, a new 300-mile road record, the women’s 500km world record, the women’s 500 mile. when she completed the latter, she danced around the start line in pink compression socks, celebrating with high fives and hugs. but the six-day mark was still out there – barwick, 1990, 549 miles. as herron slept during the day on monday, questions started popping up on running forums and facebook groups. “bell lap!” wrote ultrarunning veteran and stats master mike dobies. “did she save enough for a final push?” run, eat, hydrate, sleep, and repeat. over and over and over again for 5+ days.loving all of the official photos coming in too - they’ve captured some amazing moments for all of the athletes.sinead (crew)#further#lululemonfurtherpic.twitter.com/ibuyi1u6iu the push comes at 2.30 in the afternoon. herron is up and moving and soon the night will welcome cooler air and more miles. but after a few loops, she’s off course again. resting again. “run the routine,” she tells herself:run, eat, hydrate, sleep, and repeat. but it’s getting harder to do any of those now. as christian griffith once saidabout his run across america, the goal is “way too close for way too long.” sign up tosoccer with jonathan wilson jonathan wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from european soccer after newsletter promotion close is now 40 miles in 18 hours, and herron is up and moving, recording 15-minute miles; for her, a walking pace, a death slog. then another stop. she’s now in the realm of uncertainty the late ultrarunner al howie called the ultra daily news: “she’s dying … she’s back from the dead … she won’t make it.” all through the night she keeps up the fight and at 3.30am herron crosses the invisible threshold: 550 miles, a new world record, the biggy, the six-day."
"however, the international association of ultrarunners, which ratifies the six-day race, doesn’t call any marks past a 48-hour run a world record. in the iau’s phraseology, her performance is simply a ‘best’. herron promptly takes a nap, while praise flies in fast and furious. “it was just a matter of time,” says trishul cherns, head of the global organization of multi-day ultramarathoners, an organization that tracks ultrarunning statistics. “camille’s performance has proved that women who enter the game can compete on an equal footing with men.” crockett says she “is the greatest woman ultrarunner ever, on tracks and roads.” and barwick, the new zealander whose record or “best” or accomplishment herron broke, says she’s “in awe of her speed. a truly amazing performance, so courageous and inspiring to all athletes.” but herron isn’t done. as the sun rises over the santa rosa mountains, she lifts herself to her feet once more. one more push. one more loop, then two, three. she reaches 900km, another record, then it’s over. in her wake are 11 world records recognized by gomu and a world best performance by the iau. either way, the numbers on the led screen read a clear 560.3 miles. above is one word in all caps: further."
"not only are more runners doing ultramarathons in their seventies and eighties, they’re also going faster on a bone-cold morning in november, wally hesseltine, far from his cozy california home, was lying prone in southern illinois – beside a trail of crushed gravel – his right knee bruised and bloodied. the initial 95 miles of the tunnel hill 100 footrace had unfolded with the swiftness of a fleeting breeze. brisk, beautiful miles under a collage of crisp autumn foliage. the 80-year-old hadn’t fallen once. but the last five miles presented a particular problem. they were all downhill. he couldn’t feel it, but he could see it – his upper body drooping like a glove without a hand – his hunched shadow sinking into itself until he finally dove into the soft grass. little is known about “the leans”, a temporary but debilitating condition that can crop up in older ultrarunners. the phenomenon is oft observed but poorly understood. the same is true of hesseltine. buoyed by the clamber of voices in the distance, the octogenarian picked himself up – dashed toward the finish line – tripped on the timing mat and went airborne. for a moment it was over, the love-hate battle with time. he was now the fastest 80-year-old to ever run 100 miles. columbian novelist, gabriel garcia marquez, once wrote: “it is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.” not only are more runners doing ultramarathons in their seventies and eighties, they’re also going faster. in may, jeff hagen, 75, knocked an hour off the 50-mile record for his age group. but it wasn’t enough. gene ‘the ultra-geezer’ dykes, also 75, bested that by an hour – in the same race – smashing seven master’s records from 25 to 100 kilometers in a 12-hour period. and the record hesseltine eclipsed in november? it was so new it had yet to be ratified. four years ago, ‘fast eddy’ rousseau set it at 32 hours. this spring david blaylock brought it down to 29. hesseltine got it to 26 and along the way beat 51 of the 179 finishers, most decades younger than him. leaning back in his chair at his california law office, he jokes, “ten-minute miles are the new eight.” a myriad of suggestions exists to explain the growing presence of older athletes. a predominant theory over the last decade has been that we are merely unlocking abilities carried over from our ancestors. that as homo sapiens evolved as a nomadic species, we hunted game over long distances, our advantage being our ability to sweat. the energy and speed of the young were beneficial in the last sprints for the kill, while the elders’ tracking knowledge proved essential in pacing the animal over longer periods and bringing up the rear with supplies. exeter professor and ultrarunner dr julian jamison doesn’t see a correlation. “the hunter-gatherers weren’t living till 80,” he says and suggests a mix of patience, pacing, training and hereditary elements."
"however, he admits “the number of datapoints is still so small in ultrarunning. we simply don’t know.” many ultrarunners have long subscribed to the idea of putting “miles in the legs” while avoiding injury, and science tends to agree. three papers in the last decade have shown the benefits of cumulative distance in older ultrarunners. they pace better, take better care of their bodies, and have less injuries than their younger counterparts at both marathon and ultra distances. by racking up more miles, our endurance base strengthens and makes us capable of much more than previously imagined. seven hundred ninety-six: that’s how many ultramarathons rob apple has run. but you’ll usually find him at the back, an example of the law of diminishing returns. “i remember when he was fast,” says lazarus lake, the mastermind of the barkley marathons, his voice warm like gravy. “i tell people, if you want to run well at 70, start late.” dr hirofumi tanaka agrees. director of exercise physiology at the university of texas, he was at the world master athletics championships in march, in part to see japanese sprinter hiroo tanaka. the retired teacher burst out of the gate in the 60-meter dash as if his lane was on a conveyor belt. head down, arms and legs churning like pistons, he ran out of the camera frame of the other runners. his time? 10.95 seconds. the 92-year-old has held world records at 100 and 200 meters and didn’t start running until he was 60. sister madonna ‘the iron nun’ buder, completed her first ironman at 55, her last at 82. hiromu inada finished an ironman at 87. he started at 70. gene dykes was 56 when he ran his first marathon. at 70, he logged a 2:54. jennifer russo started ultras at 50. this spring, at 57, the mother of three ran 300 miles in three days, a mark no american woman has reached at any age. none of this surprises tanaka. “older people are getting closer to younger performances,” he says. “they are closing the gap.” he’s seen a dramatic shift in spontaneous walking speed – professorspeak for the pace at which we do everyday tasks. not long ago, 70 was the magic age when times would begin to decrease. now, it’s over 75. his research has also shown the older the age, the greater the improvement we can expect to see with training. and that, he says, applies to and should encourage all of us. he attributes much of the phenomenon of elite masters to what he calls “a formula 1 approach” – a pit crew of coaches, trainers, and various equipment for recovery. but none of these theories explain wally hesseltine. he’s run 180 ultramarathons, broken his pelvis in a skiing accident, his nose in a fall, and tore a rotator cuff on the way to the bathroom. he also didn’t start late. when he began running on 8 june 1981, ibm was launching the first personal computer."
"now, he runs with an iphone so his wife can track him and pick him up. sign up tosoccer with jonathan wilson jonathan wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from european soccer after newsletter promotion what he does have is what he calls “compulsive obsessiveness”. five days a week, he’s at his law office, handling manslaughter cases and white-collar drug crime. after work, he runs three to 10 miles, showers in the office, and goes home for dinner. no tv. no social media. instead, he reads. in 1990 he assigned himself a list of great books. “i was going to attack reading,” he says and devoted himself to at least 25 pages a day. now, he’s read over 6,000 books. he did the same with music, memorizing cds of the 1,000 greatest hits of classical, blues and country. dr tanaka has observed similar personalities in other elite aging athletes: an optimistic, goal-oriented outlook on life, good relationships, positive attitude. they are often talkative, funny and, while serious about their running, they don’t take themselves seriously. and few are more quick-witted and humorous than fast eddy rousseau. at some point in last year’s gomu 48-hour race, he quipped, “i feel like i’m dying, but i’m afraid i won’t.” he finished 100 miles, stumbled back, nearly fell, grinned, and began making jokes. this june he lost his wife, had a stroke, underwent surgery to clear out a carotid artery, and was diagnosed with afib. “all the things that happen to old runners happen to all old people in life,” says lazarus lake. “the ones that keep going just get more out of it.” despite setbacks that could have a normal 84-year-old in a nursing home, rousseau plans to be at the usa track and field 100-mile road championship in february. hesseltine hopes to be there as well. but each time, there’s a nervous feeling, a worry. maybe this is the race when i show up and i’m the only one left in my age group. one runner who won’t be there is master athletics champion david carr. the australian died in june at the age of 91. just three months before, he was in poland, in lane five, for a 400-meter race. canadianrunningcalled it “the comeback of the year (maybe century)”. in lane six was his biggest rival, hiroo tanaka. after the first loop of the 200-meter track, the japanese runner was more than 30 meters ahead. no one, certainly not carr, could’ve predicted tanaka would reach a lactic wall. but when he did, carr reacted as he had as a boy, instinctively. a runner in front of him had slowed. there was an opening. so, he called on whatever he had left and in the final stretch closed more than 20 meters of ground on tanaka for the win. he then did what he was always taught in sports; he approached his competitors and shook their hands. there’s something about seeing it, runners at ages we equate with our grandparents, that has us grasping for life hacks."
"and maybe, that’s where we miss the point. maybe what they are showing us is how to be moreinthe moment. for wally hesseltine the moment is another chance to go long – deep - into the extreme where legs burn and lungs pray for air – into parts of himself that beg him to stop. and maybe that’s what we’re all so scared to death of. stopping."
"harvey lewis, a 47-year-old ohio ultramarathoner, won the last-man-standing big dog’s backyard ultra race after running the approximate distance between san francisco and la the pleasures of winning a world championship can sometimes be small, but immediate. the evidence is plain in the smile of ultrarunner harvey lewis at 6.59pm on wednesday 25 october. lewis has just won the2023 backyard ultra world championship, but what appears to be of greater immediate relief is that after 450 miles, and for the first time in 108 hours (four and a half days), lewis will not have to run four and one sixth miles (6.7km) at the start of the next hour. ultrarunners like lewis compete in ultramarathons, or ultras. any footrace longer than a traditional marathon (26.2 miles, or 42.2 km) is considered an ultra, although within that designation there exist multitudes – in new york city alone, ultras can range frompop culture-themed 28-mile eventstoepic journeys thousands of miles in length. many ultras use a straightforward racing format: the race starts and the first person across the finish line wins. othersapply a multi-day, multi-stage structuresimilar to cycling’s tour de france.backyardultras, however, employ a unique format designed to test runners’ wills as much as their bodies. in a backyard ultra, racers must complete a four-and-one-sixth-mile trail loop every hour, starting on the hour–they must do thiseveryhour, no exceptions. matters of strategy and speed are left to the participants’ discretion. runners may take the entire hour to complete a lap, perhaps opting for slow pace to conserve energy. alternatively, if runners finish a lap in less than an hour, they can use any remaining time to eat, hydrate, sit, stretch, talk strategy with their support crew, or, crucially, to sleep. indeed, because backyard ultras run throughout the night, these minutes of sleep between laps are runners’ only chance to rest throughout the entirety of the race. by completing the four-and-one-sixth-mile loop 24 times over 24 hours, participants run exactly 100 miles per day. run, rest (if you have the time), repeat until you can’t. that’s it. it’s simple enough, yet a paradox emerges when describing backyard ultras. on one hand, they are teeming with statistics, data points and records, as if tailor-made for detailed description. conversely, such analyses do little to express the reality underlying ultraathletes’ achievements. the numbers are just too large to understand intuitively. “it doesn’t matter if it’s 37 miles or 307 miles,” says race designer lazarus lake, “people have no concept of [distance] at all.” to communicate some sense of the distances being covered, lake (familiarly known as laz, although his real name is gary cantrell) recommends describing ultrarunning accomplishments by identifying an equivalent city-to-city journey. using this method, during his championship-winning run, lewis ran the equivalent of the distance from washington dc to boston. or from san francisco to los angeles. or london to edinburgh. use whichever comparison seems the most incredible to you; all three actually fall short of the 450 miles lewis ran."
"just as statistics alone fail to accurately convey the magnitude of lewis’s accomplishment, so too does referring to lake as a ‘race designer’ neglect to describe his standing within the world of ultrarunning. among hismany other contributions to the sport, lake invented the backyard ultra itself in the early 2010s. to this day, he hosts the format’s individual world championships every other year on his 150-acre property in central tennessee. to ultrarunners, lake is something of an inscrutable, prickly-tempered guru, or even folk hero. lake prefers to describe himself more modestly as a “hillbilly from the tennessee mountains”. he also appears to enjoy alternatively satisfying and subverting the expectations that accompany his public persona. during the race, he often snaps with sincere-sounding anger at individuals for transgressions as minor as, say, standing in the wrong place. before the moment gets too uncomfortable, however, a glance toward lake’s face reveals a twinkly-eyed smile. his grumpiness is performative and productive, a technique he presumably perfected during his 35 years as a high school baseball and basketball coach. thesubject of multiple profilesover the last decade, lake isoccasionally presented as a sadistwho uses his famously difficult races to inflict as much pain as possible on runners. in conversation, this doesn’t appear to be the case. although he projects the flannel-wearing, cigarette-smoking, big-bearded image of a ‘man of the woods’, lake is a nature-loving intellectual who can chat at length about everything from college football to the effects of new technologies on labour markets. change his accent and passport, and lake would fit easily intothe much-loved tradition of british eccentrics. whatever the underlying inspiration, lake’s backyard ultras have introduced a new dynamic to the millennia-old history of competitive running and the world’s ultrarunners have noticed. just a decade into their existence, backyard ultras are now regularly held in more than 70 countries and exist within an international framework that allows for robust world championships featuring elite athletes. four and half days before lewis was able to enjoy his world-beating, record-breaking 108-hour run, he was just one of 75 world-class runners standing on a gravel driveway on a cold saturday morning in rural tennessee. venus is visible and the surrounding walnut trees are still mostly silhouettes in the dawn sky. at precisely 7.00am, lake rings a cowbell and the runners start their first lap. nearlyall of the world’s greatest backyard ultrarunners are present; jamal said, nazarri hnat, and moises lopez (the pakistani, ukrainian and venezuelan national champions, respectively) are unable to travel to the us for the competition. their countries’ flags hang prominently from the timekeeper’s table at the starting line. roughly half of the remaining runners are their home countries’ national champions, while the other half qualified by running especially impressive times at high-profile backyard ultras around the world. although all 75 have a chance at the tile, there do exist a handful of favorites. as the course recordholder (85 laps), lewis is among them."
"so is phil gore, a 37-year-old firefighter from western australia who entered the championship as the world backyard ultra recordholder –he completed 102 loopsearlier this year. the previous record of 101 loops washeld jointly by merijn geerts and ivo steyaert, both of whom were among the six belgian runners also present to the world championships (all six ranat least200 miles in the race). when asked why belgian runners seem to excel in the backyard format, steyaert replied, “because we’re stubborn.” gore mentions both geerts and steyaert when discussing the competition ahead of the event. “i saw their [record-setting] race, and it looked like they had a lot more left,” he says. gore makes the same observation about his own record-setting performance. all were prevented from pushing themselves further by a quirk of the rules governing backyard ultras – the winner can only run as far as the next best runner, plus one additional lap (eg if the second-to-last runner completes 50 laps, the remaining athlete must complete 51 laps to win, but cannot run any farther). the first two days proceed relatively uneventfully and, in retrospect, are a bit of blur. after 48 hours (and 200 miles/320 km) of racing, more than half of the starting field (and all four of the female runners) are still in the race. days three and four, however, see multiple prominent runners drop out of the race. american jennifer russo, current holder of thewomen’s backyard ultra record for most laps, takes too long to finish her 54th lap. after exceeding the one-hour time limit on his 54th lap, japan’s tokimasa hiratu tearfully apologizes for what he believes to be his poor performance (he’d run over 220 miles). canadian amanda nelson collapses at the finish line after 57 hours (she was fully recovered by the following day, even going on a 10k walk to “get the blood flowing”). irishman keith russell, who’d beenaveraging a blistering 44 minutes per lapfor more than three days, suffered a fall that prevented him from completing his 75th lap in time. “as laz would say, ‘you can’t have a bad hour,’” russell notes. after surpassing his previous personal best by 15 laps, mexican runner rodolfo ramírez earns a round of applause from the small on-site crowd after failing to complete his 76th loop. ramírez had become a fan favorite through a combination of his strong running,mexico’s historical ties to ultrarunning, and the enthusiastic on-site support of his mother (and support crew), magdalena leonides, whose patriotic flag-waving, improvised lyrics tocielito lindo, and vocal cheering for every runner made her one of the event’s most recognizable faces. the sight of the philippines’ dehydrated jivee tolentino walking to the finish of his (timed-out) 82nd lap, severely dehydrated and supported on the shoulders of his support crew, prompted murmurs about the race’s lack of an on-site ambulance. the absence of on-duty medical personnel is likely the consequence of backyard ultrarunning’s temporary presence at a crossroads somewhere between its diy, run-with-your-friends roots and its (likely) formally organized future."
"fortunately for tolentino, his support crew includes registered nurse donald sombilla. the race has more personal stories worth telling than there is space to print them here. ultimately, however, after 103 laps (and, thus, already in ‘new world record’ territory), the championship came down to a one-on-one duel of wills between lewis and ukrainian-canadian runner ihor verys. at 47 and 29 years of age, respectively, lewis and verys are a clash of contrasting styles. “it’s a quandary,” lake observes before the race is over, “because ihor is clearly the stronger runner, but harvey won’t give up. and, [in backyards], you don’t have to be the strongest runner. you just have to be strongenough.” in his 107th loop, lewis sprinted through the portion of the trail visible from the starting line, a move he later admitted was an attempt to get into verys’s head. it worked. verys failed to finish his next lap, giving an eloquent and gracious concession speech at the finish line before the cincinnati schoolteacher completes his record-setting 108th lap. owing to the previously mentioned restrictions, lewis couldn’t run farther even if he wanted to. so, he sits, smiles, and fields questions. he is at the frontier of lucidity and sleep-deprived incoherence. he mentions being “plant-powered” (lewis is vegan) and thebrighton center, the charity for which his championship-winning performance raised money. mostly, however, he smiles. he, alone among the 75 runners who competed at this year’s world championship, knows what it’s like to reach the end of lazarus lake’s endless backyard."
"courtney dauwalter smashed the course record in the women’s western states – the worlds’ oldest 100-mile race – taking almost 80 minutes off the previous leading time. meanwhile, tom evans, a former soldier, became the first briton to win the men’s event. arriving at a remote part of the sierra nevada mountain range, 379 runners – who gained a place in the race by winning a lottery – set off from olympic valley, california, before finishing in auburn, a city in placer county that is part of the sacramento metropolitan area. the first 15 miles of the 100.2-mile course were affected by snowfall, after which runners were confronted by a 16-mile section no longer protected by shade as a result of the devastation of last year’s mosquito fire. otherwise, though, conditions were relatively helpful – temperatures were the fifth-lowest in race history and well shy of the 100-degree farenheit mark (37.7°c) that has become usual. the clement weather helped the 38-year-old dauwalter record a mark of 15hr 29min 33sec – a time that beat ellie greenwood’s 2012 record by a 78 minutes – one of nine sub-18-hour finishes, a record in the women’s race. running without a pacemaker, dauwalter led from start to finish, destroying the field after the halfway point to cross the line almost an hour and 14 minutes clear of katie schide, who came second. evans, 31, had finished third in 2019, his time of 14:59:44 the fastest recorded by a non-american. for much of this year’s contest, he was accompanied by dakota jones, who had cycled the 680 miles from his home in utah to the race’s start, but dropped his adversary after mile 71. sign up tothe recap the best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion jones ended up 17th with evans crossing the line alone in 14:40:22, the fourth-best time in the race’s history."
"more meditative and less repetitive than road running, trail running offers fitness with a view. and the chances of injury are lower than you might expect jumping over tree roots and slogging up steep slopes may not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but a growing number of australians are pounding dirt instead of pavement, taking their exercise (and social lives) to the trails. you may have stood to the side for them while bushwalking, pausing patiently as cheery folk with strange little backpacks trot past. or perhaps an algorithm has fed you some idyllic shots of sweaty people on mountaintops or winding their way through a forest. australia’s trail running events calendar is increasingly packed, with more than 200 runs around the countryfrom now until the end of winter alone. there are more clubs and social groups than you could poke a hiking pole at and, of course, the scenery is beautiful. most assuringly for beginners, you’re allowed to walk before you run. “people don’t realise that it’s ok to walk and it’s encouraged,” says megan brown, a trail and ultra runner and coach based in brisbane. “and sometimes it’s actually more efficient to hike a hill [instead of] running it.” any unpaved natural surface can be a trail run, but often there are a good dose of hills. those are the two main environmental differences from road running. trails can range from gentle, meandering walking paths to narrow rocky traverses, from sandy beaches to snowy summits. brown says a trail run is more about going for an adventure than a typical road run: you have to watch your footing. “you do need to be much more alert with the rocks and roots, the ups and the downs, and picking your feet up,” she says. initially it can be mentally draining “because you have to stay so focused”. “but then once you get into a rhythm and get your confidence levels up, it’s probably more meditative … you’re out in nature, you’ve got the birds, it’s quite peaceful.” brown says the best way to build your confidence is to explore a short, local trail that you can run out and back on. if you can walk on it, you can run on it. national and state parks are good places to find trails, but large urban parks often have networks of dirt trails running through them too. brendan davies, an athletics australia running coach based in the blue mountains, says even if you’re already a runner, the varied and sometimes unpredictable terrain will affect your body differently. on a trail the impact is shared across more muscles and ligaments, which can actually reduce injury risk. “you move sideways a lot in trail running, to stabilise yourself,” davies says. “because you’re going up and down, you’re switching muscle groups continually.” this means the repetitive strain injuries many road runners develop are less likely. “sure you can get injuries like twists, ankles rolling and things like that."
"but even that decreases the longer you train on trails as well, because all the ligaments and tendons get stronger. sign up for guardian australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup but he says it is important beginner trail runners don’t try to “bite off too much too soon”. “it’s just about starting small – small distances and on easy, familiar terrain. so your body can get used to it before you try to step it up to the next level.” you won’t need new shoes either, says laura coles, owner of specialist trail running store the trail co. if you already own regular road running shoes, it is fine to start with those, then upgrade to specialised gear later on. while the cost of entry to trail running is low, it can quickly increase if you get more adventurous – or develop a taste for the latest tech. “once you’ve decided you want to stick with it, it is good to get some trail runners,” says coles. “they will make you more comfortable and your road shoes won’t get worn down.” davies suggests starting with a pair of all-round trail shoes “well fitted for your foot and your gait” with “reasonable grip”. “[trail shoes] are usually developed to drain water a bit better and have a more robust outer, so they can handle being knocked around a bit more.” davies suggests bringing your phone and a small first aid kit whenever you’re running away from residential areas. “i rarely would go out for a run in the bush without a snake bandage,” he says. “even if it is just half an hour, you never know. you just have to cover worst-case scenarios.” you can get snake bandages starting from around $10 from pharmacies – but make sure youknow how to use themfirst. sign up tosaved for later catch up on the fun stuff with guardian australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips after newsletter promotion once you start running for longer, or in more remote areas, you’ll need somewhere to put your first aid, water, food and clothes. that’s where vests and belts come in. a running vest is a small fitted backpack that won’t bounce around too much when you run where you can stash trail snacks. prices start from around $100. coles says there are loads of choices for food on the move, including gels and “powdered nutrition in your water to give you energy while you drink”. “but other people can’t stand that,” she says. “if you don’t want to get into all the technical stuff, you could just take a vegemite sandwich.” you may not need to do trail-specific training at first, but as soon as you start pushing the distances and getting more technical and steep, you will need to prepare your body more, says davies – especially if you don’t live in the mountains."
"“if you’re living in the city, and you want to come up to the mountains and run trail running races, you have to supplement your road running with some extra gym work,” he says. “maybe a couple of sessions a week, focusing on your lower body and core. “find places where you can train that will simulate running up a hill: so, stairs [and] doing hill rep sessions. it’s all about getting comfortable hiking up a hill first.” and don’t forget to hone your downhill running technique too. one of the best ways to get started trail running is to find a group to go with, because, as coles says, trail running has “a big community”. “i think because you do have to go a bit slower … you end up chatting,” she says. coles is a race director and says she sees teenagers right through to runners in their 70s. “it’s a very welcoming sport.” if you don’t have access to transport, joining a tour can take the logistics out of your hands, and they usually offer vests and hiking poles for hire. like tours, races can keep you on the right path, provide a supportive environment to run in, and sometimes open up areas that aren’t normally accessible. brown says signing up for a race can “give you something to aim for that keeps you going out on the rainy days, or the days when you’re feeling a bit flat”. added bonuses are the party at the finish line, a medal, and maybe even lifelong connections. brown even met her husband at a trail event. “we were on the run and i asked him if he had anything for chafing,” she says. “he handed me his body glide, then i proceeded to rub it all over my inner thighs. you could say it was love at first sight.” ultra-trail australia, may, new south walesthe southern hemisphere’s biggest trail running event has a 11km option if you want to get in on the action. you’ll be eyeing off the 22km in no time. perth winter trail series, may through august, western australiathis series offers four races in the perth hills, each with multiple distances ranging from 4km to 50km. south-east queensland trail running series, october through to march, queenslandthis series of races around south-east queensland has short and long options and no pressure on finish times. you can enter one event to see if you like it or sign up for the lot. warburton trail festival, march, victoriathis multi-day event in the fern-covered hills north-west of melbourne has a 5km and 9km option. plus, if you’re after something silly, there’s the lilo derby: floatation device required, dress-ups encouraged."
"erchana murray-bartlett reaches end of epic journey from ‘tip to toe’ of australia – smashing women’s record for consecutive daily marathons months after starting out from the tip of cape york, erchana murray-bartlett is set to complete her 150th consecutive daily marathon inmelbourneon monday, finishing a record-breaking journey through australia’s eastern states. murray-bartlett set out in august to run more than 6,200km, raising money for thewilderness societyand awareness of australia’sextinction crisis– just days beforened brockmannbegan his 4,000km run from the west to east coast. her journey has taken her along beaches, dirt roads and through victoria’s high country, interspersed with visits to schools and conservation groups. to date, the runner has raised more than $98,000. murray-bartlett’s final marathon is due to start at 1.30pm on monday at the pillars of wisdom in melbourne, and should end about 6pm with four loops of the tan track. the current guinness world record for most consecutive daily marathons (female) was set last august by englishwomankate jayden, who completed 106 in as many days. murray-bartlett has been keeping a detailed record of her daily runs, which the guinness world records will consider for certification after her journey is complete. the 32-year-old, who spoke breezily on the phone while finishing one of her daily marathons, said: “i’m so proud of what my body has been able to achieve. i’m so proud of the money we’ve raised.” murray-bartlett has been joined by other runners in recent weeks. “[they’re] keeping me going,” she said. “it’s distracting me from the pain in my hips and my knees and my feet.” sign up for guardian australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup nearly five months of daily running has taken its toll. murray-bartlett said her feet had increased half a shoe size and were covered in calluses. “they’re not that sightly at the moment, to be honest,” she said. “i don’t have any tendinopathies or broken bones … just overuse and soreness in my knees, lower legs and in my back. also i have this constant brain fog that is making everything really difficult. “you almost feel like you’ve aged 50 years.” the past several months have seen her run along the new south wales coastline and around the victorian peaks of mount hotham and mount feathertop. sign up toafternoon update our australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “i did more hills in december than the rest of the trip combined – i think it was 14 or 15km of elevation,” she said. to allow her body to cope with limited recovery time each day, murray-bartlett ran slower than she would have if competing in a race; she completed her marathons in about four hours, at a pace between 5min50s and 6min a kilometre. throughout her journey, she aimed to eat between 5,000 and 6,000 calories a day. “i’ve lost more weight than i anticipated, and as a nutritionist, i was very careful of that,” she said."
"“so what i even thought was a ludicrous amount of food wasn’t enough. “my intake is now four or five big meals a day and just constant snacking. i’m at the point now where i’m almost too tired to eat.” murray-bartlett’s final weekend of marathons involved a public group run along the warburton trail in the yarra ranges, as well as a run with family members, including relatives who have flown in from overseas to see her cross the finish line. “i don’t want this to ever end because i’m having a lot of fun,” she said. “but i also really do need to stop because my body is at its limit.”"
"i’ve been running uphill for over an hour, scaling this narrow mountain trail, when we pass through some trees. this must be the top, i’m thinking, hopefully, as we crest the pass. but alas, rising up on the other side are more hulking mountains and snaking up through the middle of them, like a line of ants, are the tiny dots of the runners ahead of us. “putain,” swears the french runner behind me. i know exactly how he feels. the 170kmultra trail du mont blancis the most famous trail race in the world. in the fast-growing sport of mountain ultra trail (mut) running, it’s the big one, the sport’s super bowl. for a week at the end of august each year, the town of chamonix in the french alps is completely taken over by ultra runners and their supporters. any unsuspecting visitors arriving in the area would be left baffled by this strange world of short shorts and little backpacks and super-fit people that they’d wandered into. during utmb week – which acts as the climax of the brand new utmb world series – about 10,000 runners compete across seven different races of varying lengths. i’m here to run the 100km ccc race, which starts in courmayeur in italy and follows a route around mont blanc, scaling more than 6,000m of ascent along the way, passing through switzerland, before finishing in chamonix. why would anyone want to run so far? it’s a good question. on one level, taking part in these races is an adventure into the wild. by traversing such great distances on foot, you get to explore some of the most remote corners of these incredible mountains. sure, you spend a lot of time looking down at your feet, but every time you look up, the landscape takes your breath away. but it is also a race. despite my intention to primarily run to enjoy the experience, once we get going i find myself pushing hard and i finish in under 20 hours, an arbitrary goal i set myself before the start. you can choose to go slower, of course, but it doesn’t really make things any easier, since it just means you’re out there running for longer. so i decide to embrace the inherent competitiveness of the event and get my skates on. i can then spend the rest of the weekend relaxing and soaking up the unique atmosphere of chamonix during utmb week. it’s handy that my hotel, la folie douce, is so close to the finish, so that after finally making it to chamonix in the middle of the night, i can hobble back to a hot shower and a blissfully comfy bed. the next morning i spend a heavenly few hours stretched out by the hotel’s outdoor pool with stunning views across the mountains that look a little unreal in the morning sunlight, like a huge athena poster backdrop."
"chamonix also has an abundance of great places to eat – an essential part of the post-race recovery process – from the fine seasonal french cuisine at the mont blanc hotel, the oldest, most elegant hotel in town, to the hearty soul bowls and vegan burgers at the bighorn bistro (a favourite haunt of the big-eating elite ultra runners). once i feel recovered, i head back into town to sit outside a café and cheer the last utmb runners home, each one creating a wave of noise from the crowds as they pass. for more than 100 miles and for up to 48 hours, they’ve been running up and down mountains, without sleep, and the effort is etched on their faces. having done a race myself, i feel a connection to each runner that passes, and each time it brings a tear to my eye to see them so close to finishing their epic journey. for more details on utmb mont blanc, go toutmbmontblanc.com. la folie douce has rooms from £90 per night (lafoliedoucehotels.com) to qualify for the utmb races in chamonix, you must compete in at least one of the 25 utmb world series events, where you can collect ‘running stones’ for the utmb race lottery. entries for the lottery open in december. here are five of the best utmb world series events to consider. lavaredo ultra trail, italythe serene rocky monoliths of the dolomites play host each june to this long-established race on the european mountain running calendar. setting off late at night from the town of cortina d’ampezzo – host city of the 1956 winter olympics – the race is brilliantly supported, with large crowds lining the streets to cheer you on your way. best of all, being in italy, you get to feast on endless pizza after finishing the race (lavaredo.utmb.world). speedgoat mountain races, usaheld in july on the slopes of one of the biggest ski resorts in the states, snowbird in utah, the speedgoat 50k takes runners up gruelling climbs, across tricky, rocky terrain and through the breathtaking landscape of utah’s wasatch mountains. with the entire course situated above 2,300m, this is one of the toughest mountain races in the us (speedgoat.utmb.world). ultra trail snowdonia (uts), walesthe only uk race in the utmb world series, the uts follows challenging trails and traverses hairy ridges, summiting the most notable peaks in the north of the snowdonia national park. although the series of races – over 50km, 100km and 165km – take place in july, good weather is, of course, far from guaranteed (snowdonia.utmb.world). puerto vallarta, méxicoafter crossing the sierra madre mountains, this race takes runners down through forests and agave plantations, into the jungle and then finally along the beach in the beautiful bay of puerto vallarta on mexico’s pacific coast. taking place for the first time in october 2022, this new event’s longest race is 100 miles, while there are also shorter options of 100km, 50km and 20km (puerto-vallarta.utmb.world)."

"rugby league great honours former teammate rob burrow on day two of his challenge in aid of mnd charities “this is a sponsored run,” said kevin sinfield of what seems to most people an unimaginable, surely superhuman challenge – runningseven ultramarathons in seven days. “in my own mind this is a run for a mate, with other mates.” sinfield, one of the greatest players in rugby league history, has just completed day two of what will be about 275 miles of running to raise money for motor neurone disease (mnd) charities. it is his third mad challenge in as many years. in 2020 sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days to raise money and awareness in honour of his friend and former teammate rob burrow, who is now in the grip of the disease. sinfield sees it as natural – obvious, almost – that he would try to help. “just because you’ve finished playing, doesn’t mean you stop being that teammate. you try to help,” he told the guardian. “all rob’s former teammates have played their part and done their own bit. this is an extension of that. i’m just trying to do my little bit too.” burrow wore the number seven shirt for leeds and the initial plan was to raise £777,777. in the first year, more than £2.5m was raised. the following year sinfield ran 101 miles in 24 hours, bringing the total he has raised for the cause to more than £5m. this year’s challenge is also dedicated to other sportsmen who have succumbed to mnd. they are described by sinfield as a “band of brothers” and include the formerscotlandrugby union player doddie weir, the ex-liverpool and bolton footballer stephen darby and the recently diagnosed former gloucester and leicester rugby union player ed slater. on monday sinfield ran from melrose in the scottish borders to the picturesque northumberland village of otterburn. he was mostly on the a68 and was often accompanied by music. so in scotland it was flower of scotland “and quite a lot of proclaimers”. crossing the border into england, sinfield’s team played jerusalem followed by land of hope and glory. burrow texted sinfield 15km before he finished, saying well done for finishing day two. he was of course “taking the mickey”, but that’s the way his sense of humour works, said sinfield. the two men met when sinfield was 14 and burrow 12 and they were part of the leeds academy. they became friends in the rhinos first team and clearly have an incredible bond. “there’s things that we’ve done together in training and on a rugby field that … we’ve had to go to some dark places together. i trust him implicitly. i’ve got so much respect for him and he’s a great friend.” he says the challenge is to raise cash and also awareness. “the funding that the disease could have had and should have had” didn’t happen in years gone by, said sinfield. that’s changed, “but for years and years this tragic and horrible disease has ripped through families”."
"as sinfield talks to the guardian, there isn’t a hint of fatigue. he is an hour early atotterburn castleand it is as if he has walked there from the corner shop. anyone who wants a selfie – and there are dozens – gets one. is it fun, or is it torture? “it’s probably a bit of both,” sinfield said. “i miss home – i think all the team do – so in our downtime it is important that we enjoy it. we’ve got a meal together tonight; we’ll watch the rugby and spend some time together. it is important to me that the team enjoy being here. i want this week to be the best week of their lives. i don’t know whether that is possible.” what is true is that it’s not normal to put your body through what sinfield is putting his through. he ran the last few miles of day two with the multiple world record-breaking athlete and bbc commentator steve cram, who said it was an extraordinary physical and mental challenge. “it is phenomenal what he is doing, really. i once did one ultra event and i didn’t do anything for about a week after. it is about recovery, and kevin has a body which allows him to do something like this … i am just full of admiration for him.” oldham-born sinfieldspent most of his professional career at leeds rhinos, where he became captain aged 22. he also captained england, but recently revealed on radio 4’sdesert island discsthat he did little to no research into the psychology of the role. he understood rugby lads, he said, including not booking them in to five-star hotels because they would soon all “have dressing gowns and slippers on, like they think they’re on holiday. so you can’t do that for a game prep. you put them in three-star and they moan.” the result is four-star, with decent biscuits. sinfield started his challenge at scotland’s murrayfield ground in edinburgh on sunday morning and aims to finish on saturday at old trafford in manchester during half-time of the men’s rugby league world cup final. the money sinfield raises will be shared by themotor neurone disease association,leeds hospitals charity,the darby rimmer mnd foundation,my name’5 doddie foundationandmnd scotland. donations to sinfield’s appeal can be madehere."
"trail running events have rapidly expanded in the last decade but extreme weather is casting a shadow on the sport more than 5,000 people lined up forultra-trail australia(uta) on the last weekend in october, making it the largest trail running event in the country and, according to the race organisers, the second-largest in the world. but the multi-day event, which includes 50km and 100km ultramarathons, nearly didn’t go ahead because of the sport’s vulnerability to extreme weather and climate change. uta, which is owned by ironman, was postponed in may after heavy rain, and the lead-up to the october event was again hampered by severe wet weather. the 50km and 100km courses were altered from sweeping loops through the megalong valley in the blue mountains to mostly out-and-back routes with more road running. the uta race director, nick christopher, says it was “a mission” to get october’s race ready, with the final courses locked in less than a month before the event. “it takes a very calculated approach to understand which trails have the capacity to withstand the runners and the rain, as well as which ones you might need to avoid,” he says. extreme weather and climate change are also affecting the industry at bigger scales. paul ashton, the director of another race company,runningwild, says the window for alpine trail running in australia is getting smaller, and riskier, every year. “climate change is having an inordinate impact,” he says. ashton’s mount buller race used to be held in february, but too many days of extreme heat at that time of year forced it back to april. “now i don’t do any runs basically between mid-december and early march because of the risk of bushfires,” he says. “but now you get floods and road slips and snowstorms in november. and march and april are fine.” at the end of last month la niña took its toll as ashton rescheduled another alpine trail run from later this month to april 2023, because oflandslips in falls creekafterheavy rain. last week ski resorts were blanketed in snow after an unseasonable cold snap across the country’s south-east, just as places like mount buller were preparing to open their summer trails to mountain bikers and walkers. severe weather events don’t just wreak havoc with the running calendar, they also often impact the long-term viability of walking and running trails in the landscape. “climate change is going to be significant, especially once we get el niño back, and the drying out and the threat of bushfires,” ashton says. victorian runner ben clark, 45, ran his seventh uta 100km this year, and says the trail community has seen what happens when races go wrong. one of the most high-profile race tragedies occurred in 2011 when several runners were caught in a bushfire during an ultrarunning race in the kimberley. turia pitt suffered burns to 60% of her body andsupreme court action against the race organisers ended in an out-of-court settlement. last year21 runners died in gansu, china when extreme weather hit an ultramarathon."
"while some people expressed disappointment at the changes to this year’s uta event, others understood the need. “they make the changes to keep us safe and allow us to go out and do the run,” clark says. “while there’s no incidents, we’ve got more chance of these events continuing to happen.” despite trouble with an injury clark finished uta in less than 13 hours, and it was the bushfire-affected landscape that stood out on the new route. “it was very exposed, and unfortunately lots of black trees to look at,” he says. “we were just out in the sun and that part of it was unpleasant.” but the course also offered some nice surprises. “the waratahs were out in bloom, explosions of red all over the place,” clark says. “that was very cool, not something we would ever get to see on a normal year.” christopher acknowledges uta “this year wasn’t the cleanest run”. “but when you talk to people that ran the race afterwards, the excitement and joy, and the new challenge that was presented to them definitely outweighs a little bit of a wait to get that information,” he says. trail running events have rapidly expanded in the last decade – from less than 10 events to more than 300 in 2022, most with multiple distances on offer from 1km to more than 300km. tour de trails director and tourism consultant, chris ord, says the sport’s growth spurt has been fuelled by people’s desire to be outdoors and a low barrier to entry. sign up tothe recap the best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion “you don’t need to spend a lot of money,” he says. “and you’ve got a low skill threshold. at the very core of trail running is this idea of a return to nature. you get the mental health benefits of being in nature and being active at the same time. that is a very addictive thing … generally once you’re in, you’re just absolutely hooked on trial running.” ord says technology improvements have also encouraged people to try trail running. “you can jump online and there’ll be a facebook group that covers the region you’re trying to run in,” he says. “there’ll be a million different mapping applications … you’ve got all this access to information.” the victorian ultra runners group, of which clark is a member, has almost 3,000 active members on facebook, where people share tips about local routes and training, and swap stories from events. clark started trail running in 2012 and remembers the humble beginnings. “in those first few years, you’d turn up for a race and you pretty much know everyone who was there,” he says. “whereas now you turn up and you may not know anyone.” after getting “wet, muddy and filthy” on his first trail run clark made the switch from road running. “i just had an absolute blast and thought, ‘oh, this is brilliant."
"where else can you run around in the mud and it’s socially acceptable?’ and then it just kind of snowballed from there.” and so did the sport in australia. trail running is running on any natural unpaved surface, usually on bushwalking tracks and often with a good dose of steep hills. when ashton started running wild in 2000 his races had about 10 runners each, they now average 200 runners an event. ord says trail running has “an alchemy that i just don’t think exists in pretty much any other sort of pursuit”. “i guess maybe bushwalking. if you magnify the benefits and fun of bushwalking – that’s trail running.” the flip side of the climate challenge is that because people take part in the sport to be in nature, ord says more become advocates for the environment. “trail running is one of the jigsaw pieces that gets people out to see it, experience it, love it, value it, fight for it.”"
"kevin sinfield will run seven ultramarathons in seven days in november as he continues his campaign to raise money and awareness to help people affected by motor neurone disease. this is the third challenge in as many years taken on by sinfield, whose great friend and former leeds rhinos teammate rob burrow has the condition. sinfield, 42, previously ranseven marathons in seven daysin 2020 before running from leicester tigers’ home ground welford road, where he is defence coach, to the rhinos’ headingley stadium in under 24 hours last october, raising more than £5m. this time sinfield will run from murrayfield stadium in edinburgh to old trafford in manchester, visiting melrose, newcastle, middlesbrough, york, leeds and bradford and covering more than 60km per day. he will start on sunday 13 november and is aiming to arrive at old trafford at half-time during the rugby league world cup final the following saturday. burrow is one of several former sportsmen fighting mnd, including rugby union’s doddie weir and ed slater and the footballer stephen darby. the main beneficiaries of the challenge will be the mnd association and leeds hospitals charity’s appeal to build the rob burrow centre for mnd in leeds, while there will also be donations to mnd scotland, my name’5 doddie foundation, the darby rimmer mnd foundation and the 4ed campaign. sinfield told therhinos.co.uk: “undoubtedly this will be the toughest challenge yet. we have tried to combine elements of our two previous events to create the ultra 7 in 7. “people living with mnd have no choice but to live with their condition every day and they are inspiration for all of us taking part in the challenge. there has been some exciting news in recent days about current drug trials and we can all feel that a breakthrough is close. “mnd is not incurable, it has just been underfunded, and i have belief that by raising funds we can give the scientists and researchers the best possible opportunity to find that cure. we also need to help those living with mnd, to give them hope and love so they know we are with them.” sign up tothe recap the best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion burrow, who celebrated his 40th birthday on monday, added: “i’ve said it many times before, everyone should have a friend like kevin. i am sure this will be tough and i can’t wait to see kevin and the guys along the way to cheer them on. “people have already been so generous over the last two years and, as a patron of the mnd association, i would like to say a massive thank you, your support has made the world of difference to so many people. go safe kev and please support them as much as you can.”"
"new models explain conditions that led to 21 runners dying at china event, and could help improve accuracy of future forecasts in late may 2021, 172 runners set out to tackle a 100km ultramarathon in north-west china. by the next day21 of the runners had been killedby hypothermia after an unexpectedly intense storm brought freezing temperatures, strong winds and hail to an upland section of the course. weather forecasts had predicted a cold front, but had not captured how extreme the conditions would be. there are no meteorological stations in the area and survivor reports are subjective, but now a new hyper-local weather model – using topographic data at tens of metre resolution rather than kilometres – indicates that the intense wind and rain caused temperatures to drop by 6.7°c. taking the blizzard-like conditions into account and the effect of wet clothes on body temperature, the study – which is published in thejournal of geophysical research: atmospheres– estimates that runners would have experienced an apparent temperature of -10°c. storms like this are common at high altitudes on mountains like everest, and while rarer at lower elevations, their sudden arrival makes them particularly dangerous. the researchers suggest hyper-local weather models can improve forecast accuracy for mountain events, where steep mountain slopes generate highly localised effects on wind, rain and temperature at a scale too small to be picked up by conventional weather forecasts."
"laurie brophy, my daughter-in-law’s father, who has died aged 90 from oesophageal cancer, was deeply involved in his local community in pencoed, near bridgend, south wales, inspiring others with his voluntary work and fundraising for thehomeless charity llamauand thechildren’s disability charity y bont. his first major fundraising exploit came on a very hot day in 1997, running the london marathon in a fur badger suit in aid of badger protection. two years later, he ran his first ultra-marathon, themarathon des sables, a brutal six-day 156-mile race across the sahara, the oldest competitor at 67. he did several more ultra-marathons, his last aged 79, in the atacama desert. born in battersea, south-west london, laurence was the son of mabel (nee thomas), a housemaid, and john brophy, a stonemason. he was educated at king edward grammar school, birmingham, and joined the insurance industry, but after the death of his sister patricia in 1962 left to travel around europe. he settled in italy for a while before returning to study italian at cardiff university, graduating in the early 1960s, and train as a teacher. at university he met ruth jones, an italian and german teacher, and, after they married in 1969, they settled in pencoed, where laurie taught french and italian at the local comprehensive school for nine years, working as a supply teacher for nine further years before retiring. in an active retirement, laurie was involved in badger protection, often sleeping out in woodlands to protect setts from baiting, as well as litter picking and other community activities. he was a founder member of the bridgend astronomical society and a member of the green party, for which he stood at the 2015 election. he spent a lot of time helping in local primary schools, taking the children running, nature-watching and fossil-hunting. laurie was a kind man with great humility. he was an adventurer, living a life full of challenges with limited resources. on his last ultra-marathon he was hospitalised with a kidney problem, so was not allowed to enter again. unhappy about being told he was too old to race, he went to chile the following year to attempt the distance solo. he then began his journeys by foot and bike closer to home, giving himself an annual fundraising challenge. he walked the length of offa’s dyke and the taff trail and cycled from land’s end to john o’groats to raise funds for llamau, at 88 the oldest person to complete this journey. he often slept on the roadside during this challenge to raise awareness of homelessness. aged 89, his final adventure was to cycle and climb the three welsh peaks, pen y fan, cadair idris and snowdon. he did not know at the time that he had cancer, but he completed the challenge with the support of fellow climbers. ruth survives him, as do their daughters, katy and sam, and five grandchildren, raven, noah, seth, felix and joni."
"participants in the tennessee race must negotiate extreme temperatures, wild terrain and more than 50,000 feet of accumulated ascent at 6.54am on 8 march 2022, 39-year old johanna bygdell from sweden was perched next to her tent in the middle of frozen head state park, tennessee, eating breakfast with her boyfriend when she finally heard the noise she had been both craving and dreading. it was the blowing of a conch, marking one hour until the start of arguably the world’s most hellish race: the barkley marathons. “finally, let’s get the party started,” she thought. bygdell made her final preparations, packing clothes and food, and honed in on her goal of finishing the annual 100-mile ultra endurance challenge. this year, around 40 other determined runners from around the world gathered behind the race’s famous starting line, a yellow gate, with the same hope. but finishing the barkley marathons is an anomaly. since its conception in 1986, only 15 runners have managed to conquer the merciless course – which features punishing sections with names such as checkmate hill, little hell, rat jaw and testicle spectacle. most years see no finishers at all in the race’s 60-hour time limit. and 2022 was no exception. despite no one finishing, one barkley first-timer, jasmin paris, beat the clock to become the first woman in a decade to complete three loops – otherwise known as the ‘fun run’. “this was one of the years that the barkley felt like an entity in itself, picking people off one at a time that you thought would finish,” says race director gary ‘lazarus lake’ cantrell (most runners just call him ‘laz’), who co-founded the race in the decade followingthe 1977 breakout of martin luther king’s assassin, james earl ray, from the nearby brushy mountain state penitentiary. during his 55 hours of freedom, ray covered just 12 miles of ground. “i could do at least 100,” mocked laz. as is tradition, laz lights a cigarette to kick things off – an unorthodox start for an unorthodox race. when the embers glow, participants have just 60 hours to complete five rounds of the same unmarked 20 mile (give-or-take) loop: twice clockwise, twice counterclockwise, with the leading runner dictating the final loop direction – if any make it that far. one hundred miles in 60 hours may not seem too tough a task – after all the world record for the distance on footis just under 11 hours. but the barkley marathons course is unmarked (competitors are allowed a map and compass), has an accumulated ascent of more than 50,000 feet through thick woodland, and is subject to temperature extremes. “the first lap was run in really hot conditions, too hot for my liking, and then the second lap was the opposite, unbelievably cold with lots of rain,”said british runner nicky spinksafter competing in the 2019 race. all the while, racers must locate books hidden along the route as proof of completion."
"that task was something first timer enrico frigeri, a 34-year old teacher and personal trainer from brazil, struggled with amidst the gnarled terrain and extreme weather. after completing the first loop alongside a race veteran, frigeri entered loop two alone, but struggled to navigate the course and therefore locate the books in time. “it was then i knew that barkley had won,” he says. still it was an impressive feat, given that he only began training for the event 45 days prior, after being hospitalised for three months. “just completing the loop was fantastic. i feel very satisfied,” he says. with no official race website, quirky race legends are left to reverberate within the running community – some true, some not. after paying just $1.60 to apply, successful entrants receive a ‘letter of condolence’. “virgins” (first-timers) must contribute a licence plate from their home state or country as part of their race fee, while returning competitors must submit an additional requested item. changing from year to year, previous examples include a pair of socks and a flannel shirt. in the rare instance a previous race victor returns to take on the course, a pack of camel cigarettes suffices as payment: the antithesis of modern-day ultrarunning race fees, which can sometimes be upwards of $1,000 for well-known races. laz chuckles when asked about the “human sacrifice”. he or she is the runner laz allegedly believes is the least likely to complete a lap, and is assigned the no 1 bib. “it’s a common misconception,” he says. “people write in and say ‘i want to be the human sacrifice, i’ll be terrible!’ no. everyone who’s there are accomplished runners. everyone who’s there belongs. the people who are the human sacrifice are the people who don’t want to be the human sacrifice.” race veterans play a crucial role in the race, with their accrued knowledge helping to maximise their chances of succeeding. “you have to have a mix of people,” says laz. “very few people are going to give their best effort the first time. so once people have gone through this whole process, you try to give people the chance to give their best effort out there. if everyone was new then it would be catastrophic.” with plenty of veterans returning this year, includingrecord-breaking ultra runner courtney dauwalter, laz is surprised 2022 didn’t produce a champion. “you’re always rooting for people to complete it. you know how much they put into it and how high their hopes are, but you can’t always count on it. i really thought we would have a finisher this year,” he says. one veteran, tomokazu iraha, a 44-year old running coach from japan, was “very pumped” to return for his third attempt at the race after an involuntary hiatus due to the pandemic.runningwith two years of barkley experience behind him, iraha felt confident. “i was mostly on my own unlike the past two attempts,” he says."
"“it felt great!” despite his experience, however, he was one of the earliest to be “doomed”, according to laz – proof that predicting the barkley is a fool’s game. iraha fell and hit his knee on a rock during the first loop, and time constraints forced him to pull out after the second. “by the time i got to little hell, the heavy rain made the steep climb very slippery, so it was like moving three steps forward and sliding two steps back,” says iraha. “my feet [were] wet and cold until finally they became numb. i had five hours … to make it under the loop two cut-off [26 hours 40 minutes], but not for a five loop cut-off. so the best i could have done at this point was a fun run. “when you are fresh and in a different mind set, you think you should go for that third loop. but after you are beaten down and have a low body core temperature after a very cold and rainy night, you don’t have that mindset anymore. i touched the yellow gate at 26:15:27, giving me enough time [to consider] a third loop turnover. laz and all the others encouraged me to go for it: ‘you’ve got this, tomo!’. so i went to the bathroom to rethink as i sat underneath a warm shower to bring my body temperature back up … but my body refused to go back … my third barkley was over.” like others, however, iraha is undeterred; he aspires to be the first asian man to finish the barkley. “it’s kind of scary to do a challenge when there’s such a high chance for failure,” he says. “but i am sure that’s the beauty of the barkleys. and that’s why i’m hooked so much.” laz shares iraha’s optimism for 2023. “you’ve got people that are ready,” he says. but it is the barkley marathons after all. “you never know what’s going to happen.”"
"37-year-old data scientist completed feat many walkers see as a lifetime challenge in five and a half days a former world of warcraft fanatic who was “good but not great” at running at school has broken the record for scaling all 214 wainwright fells in thelake district. many walkers set themselves a lifetime challenge of summiting every peak in alfred wainwright’s seven-volume pictorial guide to the lakeland fells. john kelly, a 37-year-old data scientist from tennessee in the us, completed them all in five days, 12 hours and 14 minutes. he slept between one and 2.5 hours a night, taking micro-naps in a camper van at 25 meeting points along the way. “i’m told i napped between bites of pizza at one point,” he told the guardian. he attempted to eat 300 calories every hour, but said it was impossible to replace the energy he burned each day. the father of four smashed therecord set last year by sabrina verjee– who supported him in this attempt – by about 11 hours. he was also assisted bynicky spinks, a breast cancer survivorwho has broken numerous fell running records; evidence, he says “of just how supportive and strong theultrarunningcommunity is”. the 320-mile (515km) challenge, which includes england’s highest mountain, scafell pike, involves a total ascent of 36,000m (118,000ft). kelly had to abort his first attempt at the challenge last july after suffering with heat and foot problems. his children – five-year-old twins, an 8-year-old and a 19-month-old – joined him for the last leg of the run on saturday. “it was kind of funny because i had to ask my eight-year-old to slow down because he ran off so fast,” said kelly. he insisted he was never a brilliant athlete growing up. “i ran cross-country and did athletics at school, but i wasn’t the top person on the team. i was good, but not great; i could do 5km in around 17 minutes.” his training for ultrarunning mostly takes place on his daily commute, running 10km to and from his office in bristol, where he is the tech co-founder at envelop risk analytics. onhis website, where he calls himself the random forest runner, kelly describes his previous passions, saying he “used to be a pretty serious water-skier. andworld of warcraftplayer. but now just family, work, and running.” asked by the guardian why he runs, kelly said: “facing these types of challenges that put us at our absolute limits really strips us down to who we are: what our strengths are, what our weaknesses are. we learn how to leverage those, how to mitigate them. and i get to do this while doing an activity i love, which is being out in the mountains and exploring as many of them as possible in the time i have.” kelly is a winner of the barkley marathons, often described as the world’s toughest endurance race, which sees competitors try to run 100 miles within 60 hours in the tennessee wilderness."
"he also holds the record for completing all 258 miles of the pennine way, finishing in 58 hours and 4 minutes last may. in addition, he has completed the grand round (the paddy buckley round in wales, the bob graham round in thelake district, and the ramsay round in the highlands) continuously, linking them by bike. he and his family are returning to the us at the end of the month, and his next challenge is the 100-mile hardrock race in colorado."
"safety warnings were not issued before tragedy in which 21 runners died in gansu, china one word in a weather forecast could mean the difference between life and death. in may, ultramarathon runners were crossing a stretch of the yellow river stone forest park in north-west china when the temperature dropped suddenly and they werestruck by gale-force winds and freezing rain. the runners were wearing only shorts and t-shirts. they had foil blankets for protection from hypothermia, but these were insufficient and21 runners diedof cold and exposure. chinese media were outraged because the bad weather had been predicted. a study into the catastrophe concluded that the problem lay with the process of turning weather forecasts into public communication. weather forecasts drive impact forecasts which in turn drive weather warnings. analysis in advances in atmospheric sciences noted that while meteorologists did predict a “high impact event”, this would not normally have presented a significant hazard, and so did not lead to safety warnings. the disaster happened because on this particular day the area was occupied by hundreds of lightly dressed runners who were at much greater risk of exposure than locals. what seems a linguistic nuance, the distinction between high impact and high risk, led to the tragic deaths of 21 people. chinese authorities say they will strive for better weather communications and hazard assessments in future."
"a hundred athletes are picked each year for the 135-mile race. this time the climate was especially brutal in the badwater basin at the bottom of california’s death valley, the air feels like a giant hair dryer and the pavement can melt the soles of your shoes. yet on monday night, 100 of the world’s top endurance runners set off on what has become known as “the world’s toughest foot race”, carving 135 miles of terrain through one of the planet’s most extreme climates at the most intense time of year. only 100 runners are selected from around the world each year to compete in the badwater 135 ultramarathon. last year it was cancelled due to the pandemic – but this year the race was back on, even in the face of a historic drought and unprecedented heatwaves. on 9 july, death valleyhit 130f(54.4c), the highest recorded in the valley – and on earth – since 1913. “we all think they’re a little crazy,” said abby wines, a spokesperson for death valley national park, “but we’re in awe of them as ultra-athletes.” wines watched the first wave of 33 runners leave the starting line at 8pm on monday night. at that late hour, the big white digital thermometer in front of the park’s furnace creek visitor center read 110f but by the time the racers were finishing crossing the flat expanse of the valley tuesday afternoon, temperatures were closer to 115f. wines said the competitors drew both admiration and head-shaking from the 145 hardy souls who live in the valley full time: “even living here, we all struggle with the heat.” ultramarathoning has boomed in popularity in recent years but hasalso faced criticismfor its dangers; in may this year, 21 ultramarathoners died in chinaamid extreme weather conditions. but for many ultrarunners, it’s the sheer scale of the challenge that draws them to the badwater race. “it’s unlike any other race on earth,” said dean karnazes, who has run the badwater 11 times, dropping out only once after collapsing in the heat. “not only is there the heat, but there is a ferocious headwind, like having a blow dryer in your face. everyone runs on the white line, because the asphalt can melt your tennis shoes.” runners go to extreme lengths to prepare their bodies for the heat. for karnazes, who did not race this year, that meant doing sit-ups and push-ups in the sauna at his gym. he’d also drive to death valley for the race wearing several layers of parkas with the heat in his car turned all the way up. the race climbs from the lowest elevation in north america, at 280ft (85m) below sea level, to where the road ends on the way up mount whitney in the eastern sierra nevada mountains, at 8,360ft. each runner is trailed by their own support crew in an air-conditioned minivan, which leap-frogs their progress, stopping every few miles to provide them gushes of water from spray bottles, electrolytes, ice cubes, snacks and extra changes of shoes."
"race organizers also provide medical staff and are required by the park to provide their own ambulances. this is essential, wines said, because the closest real emergency hospital is 125 miles away in las vegas and helicopters can’t fly in heat greater than 118f. the park’s rangers get several calls a week to rescue visitors who are experiencing symptoms of heat illness, but the race has not produced any serious injuries, wines added. the race takes place over a 48-hour period. by tuesday night, harvey lewis, a cincinnati high school teacher and 10-time competitor, had won,clocking a time of 25 hours and 50 minutes through the course. a few hours later, the noted ultramarathon runner sally mcrae, 42, won the women’s division, crossing the finish line around 6am on wednesday. though many international competitors were unable to travel for this year’s race due to the pandemic, the runners represented 17 countries and 29 states, including 24 women and 60 men, with entrants ranging in age from 28 to 76. there is no prize money for the race, but those who finish in less than 48 hours receive a coveted badwater 135 belt buckle. “to even apply to enter the race, the runners have to have done a series of other tough ultra races,” said the race director, chris kostman, in aninterview last week on accuweather tv. he said a committee then studied the qualifications of each runner. “it’s much more detailed than applying to a college or getting a job, because our goal is to host a race with people who are capable of finishing the race.” arnold begay of tulsa, 58, was attempting to finish the race for a second time, representing the navajo nation. on the podcastrun the riot, he said his childhood living on an arizona reservation with no electricity or water had given him the preparation he needed for this kind of event. but, he said, his first run of the course in 2009 had been much worse than he had ever expected. “it was like my gut was torn out,” he said. “i took a beating. i have never experienced this kind of agony.” but he said somehow, after working as a support crew member in the last race in 2019, he was drawn to do it again. it appeared from the race stats that begay dropped out some time after completing the first 42 miles nearly 12 hours into the race. while karnazes won the race in 2004, it is the many pitfalls and misadventures of the course he remembers most vividly. “i don’t like to say i won, i just survived the fastest,” he said. he remembers passing rattlesnakes, scorpions and tarantulas, who come to warm themselves on the road at night, and having his crew take his temperature and feed him whole chunks of ice to make sure his core temperature wasn’t shooting towards heatstroke."
"he said that runners’ feet swelled so much, as they made their way through the heat and up the three major climbs of the relentless course, that competitors regularly carried several bigger shoe sizes so they could upsize during the race. runners often covered themselves head-to-toe in white, uv-resistant fabrics to avoid blistering, he said. nevertheless, the glaring reflection of sun off the road could sunburn the inside of your nostrils or the roof of your mouth. karnazes, who wrote about the badwater race in his booka runner’s high, remembers the first time he ran the badwater – and failed to finish – in 1995. the rv he had rented for his support crew had blown up and he had tried to go on by himself without help. he said the crew had eventually found him passed out on the roadway and had taken him to a hotel to revive him. he had woken up wondering why he wasn’t still in the race, but he was determined to come back and do it again and again. “there’s magic in misery,” said karnazes, who still runs ultramarathons but promised his family he would give up the grueling badwater, after he ran his 10th race in 2013. he admits he’s still drawn by the sheer hell of it. “i’m very tempted,” he said. “i’ll probably go back.” wines says the stamina of the runners is refreshing for park rangers who are used to people making extremely short summer visits to the park. “in the summer, most people just drive through and take a picture of the thermometer,” wines said. “they jump out of their air-conditioned cars, feel the heat and then get back in again. which is fine, because regular people, who aren’t acclimated to the heat, shouldn’t push it.” but, she said, these racers “are putting themselves up against the landscape at the most extreme time of the year, which is an admirable way of experiencing it”."
"the british ultrarunner sabrina verjee has shattered the record for completing all of the lake district’s 214 wainwright peaks in less than six days – making her the fastest athlete, male or female, by more than six hours. the 40-year-old veterinary surgeon from ambleside finished the 325-mile route, which included the summit of england’s highest mountain, scafell pike, in five days, 23 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds to beat the previous best, set by paul tierney in 2019. verjee said she had only stopped only for food, running repairs and, very occasionally, for two or three hours’ sleep or rest. “it feels absolutely awesome,” she said after finishing early on wednesday morning. “my body held out better than i expected and i was able to maintain a good pace throughout. “the wainwrights have become an obsession and i felt that i could and should complete a round in under six days, so i am over the moon to have proved myself right and finally put it to bed,” she added. “and if what i have done inspires more people – especially girls and women – to get out there and challenge themselves, then that’s an added bonus.” verjee’s extraordinary achievement, which included 36,000 metres of ascent, is the latest in a growing trend of records set by women in long-distance races. in january 2019, the british ultrarunner jasmin paris became thefirst woman to win the 268-mile montane spine racealong the pennine way – shattering the course record by 12 hours while also expressing breast milk for her baby at aid stations along the route. eight months later the us swimmer sarah thomas became the first woman toswim the channel four times in a row, a feat that took her 54 hours and 10 minutes. more recently another american, maggie guterl, became the first woman to win thebig dog backyard ultra in tennessee, where the last man or woman standing wins. she ran for 60 hours and covered 250 miles. verjee is well-known in ultrarunner circles, and last year set the record for the fastest known female time on the pennine way, completing the 268 miles in three days 2hr 28min. in 2020, she was the first woman to run the wainwrights, which get their name from alfred wainwright’s seven-volume pictorial guide to the lakeland fells, in six days, 17hr and 51 min. it was the third-fastest time ever but verjee said that she did not want it to be considered for records as she had needed substantial support from fellow runners after suffering a knee injury. an attempt at the overall record in may had to be abandoned due to sub-zero conditions and blizzards that led to an exacerbation of her asthma and caused breathing problems. after pulling out, she said: “this story isn’t over. i love running and i love exploring the wainwrights. we have unfinished business.” it proved to be a case as verjee, whose latest record attempt began from her home in langdale last friday, was always ahead of her target time."
"as she neared her goal she attracted a growing online following, who sent her messages via her tracking app, that were passed on to her as she ran. “it was really nice to have these little pick-ups, with people saying i’ve inspired them or their children to go out running,” she added. verjee also paid tribute to her husband, ben, and a large support crew of friends, for helping her before suggesting she would now move onto fresh targets. “i couldn’t have done it without them – so i wouldn’t want to put them through another one!” she added."
"the events can be gruelling and even dangerous, yet more and more people are signing up john stocker hadn’t slept in three-and-a-half days when he finally crossed the finish line after running more than 337 miles in an ultramarathon event in suffolk, stopping only at brief intervals for food and rest. of the 123 people who started the race in knettishall heath on 5 june, he was the last person still running 81 hours later on tuesday evening, and had to summon all of his physical and mental strength to get around the last lap. “your tiredness just takes over. and then i clipped my toe and went down on the concrete. i laid there thinking i wasn’t going to be getting back up,” the 41-year-old personal trainer said, as he recovered at home in bicester. “but the whole reason i do these ultras is to show my kids that they should try to achieve as much as they can, and not be told by anyone that they can’t do something. that’s what kept me going.” ultrarunning has soared in popularity, with areport in mayshowing a 345% increase in participation globally over the past 10 years and thousands of events taking place annually. meanwhile, participation in 5ks has declined since 2015, and participation in marathons has levelled off. the term broadly refers to any race over the length of a marathon, and can come in many shapes and forms – including the six-day, 251kmmarathon des sablesacross the sahara, and thespine raceacross the pennine hills covering 431km. “it has been an explosion. when i came to ultrarunning about 14 years ago, i did a google search and found about 60 races. now we estimate there’s probably about 10,000,” said steve diedrich, the founder of the website run ultra. “the pandemic put people into two categories: the people who sat on the couch and the people who got off the couch. and those who got off the couch have pushed themselves further and become ultrarunners.” adharanand finn, the author of the rise of the ultra runners, said: “generally as running has got more popular and more people have done marathons there’s a natural inflation. to tell people you’ve run a marathon is maybe not as impressive as it once was. “these races are so epic and so huge, people are so impressed and it’s easy to get sucked in by that.” the uk has a long history of ultrarunning in the form of fell races, but races specifically labelled as ultras are on the increase. the “back yard challenge” races, which originated in the us, are particularly gruelling; at the suffolk event participants had to run a 4.167-mile (7km) route every hour until they could no longer carry on. if runners complete their lap early they can take a short break to sleep, eat and use the toilet before heading back to the start line. “it’s like groundhog day."
"because you get back to the tent and you’ve got a few minutes and then all of a sudden it’s your next loop, it starts all over again,” said stocker. “i still have nightmares now of them blowing the whistle over and over again.” along with his fellow runner matthew blackburn, he beat the world record for the event previously held by karel sabbe, a belgian dentist who ran 312.5 miles (502km) in 75 hours in october. now the pair will head to tennessee to take part in the back yard ultra world championships and compete against the best in the field. the races are not without risk. the ultrarunning community is still reeling from thedeaths of 21 runnersin an ultramarathon event in china last month after high winds and freezing rain hit the course. the countryhas suspended all long-distance racesand an investigation into the tragedy is being carried out. “through the history of ultraracing there have been issues with floods, cold exposure, heat exposure, a range of everything depending on the location,” but deaths are very rare, said diedrich. in its 35-year history, two people have died taking part in the marathon des sables. “we have to have some sort of a safety net, because you’re asking people to push to the absolute limit of their exhaustion,” said lindley chambers, the owner of challengerunning, which organised last week’s suffolk back yard ultra. he said the route was carefully mapped out to avoid risk of injury and staff were on hand to aid runners at all times. “you need to be sensible, and manage the risks as best you can,” he said. “but then on the other side, the runners want it to feel like an adventure, they want to feel like they’re challenged. they don’t want you to hold their hand all the way round.”"
"authorities crack down on sports including trail running and wingsuit flying ahead of centenary celebrations china has indefinitely suspended extreme sports events, including ultramarathons, trail running and wingsuit flying, in response to the deaths of 21 long-distance runners in gansu last month. extreme weather hityellow river stone forest trail racein gansu province a few hours into the race on 22 may as many of the competitors were crossing a remote and treacherous part of the 100km mountain track. of the 172 competitors,21 diedand eight were injured. scores of competitors sheltered in caves, some rescued by residents from nearby villages. on wednesday the general administration of sportannouncedan indefinite suspension of all “high-risk sports events with unclear management responsibilities, imperfect rules and unclear safety protection standards”. these included cross-country running, wingsuit flying, ultramarathons and desert races, “in order to fully guarantee the health and to safeguard the lives of the people”, it said. “the general administration of sport will conduct a comprehensive review of sports events, accelerate improvements of the management system, improve standards and regulations, and comprehensively strengthen management to ensure the safety of sports events.” the administration’s statement also ordered local authorities not to hold competitive sport events unless necessary, and to cancel any other high-risk events in the lead-up to next month’s celebrations of the chinese communist party’s centenary, in order to ensure “a good environment and atmosphere”. it said local governments must conduct risk assessments of competitive activities and related services including safety management, analysis of weather and geological conditions, and emergency rescue. the suspensionwas first reported by the south china morning post. in the wake of the gansu race, numerous marathons and running events were postponed or cancelled. family members and survivors demanded accountability for what some said was a “manmade disaster”. in its announcement, the administration said the incident was “in part due to sudden changes in weather [and] caused a great loss of human life – a lesson imbued with deeply felt grief.” among the concerns raised about the disaster were an apparent lack of awareness of the changing weather, the lack of cold weather gear in the mandatory equipment list, and the long delay in cancelling the race once things began to go wrong. multiple accounts of the gansu disaster hinted at poor contingency plans and communication to local rescue authorities, who struggled to access the terrain and locate stranded competitors. several hours passed between the first messages for help and the full deployment of rescue teams. commentators also noted the explosion in popularity of endurance running in china, suggesting there were too few experienced organisers to run the hundreds of races now held every year. tourism officials often see a race as a high-profile way to promote their region and to win favour with their superiors, potentially without enough regard for the danger. china’s high-level central commission for discipline inspection is also investigating the circumstances surrounding the tragedy."
"twenty-one competitors died in the freezing chinese mountains, raising major questions about safety in the sport at the starting line of the gansu ultramarathon, it was cold but the sun was shining. one competitor struggled to warm up, even after jogging a quick 2km, and noticed some of the elite competitors were wearing shorts and shivering. in nearby towns, the temperature was reportedlyalready droppingand winds increasing, but the 172 runners didn’t know that. in a widely shared account ofthe horror that followed, published online, the anonymous runner described the conditions that led to the death of 21 competitors and the admission of eight others to hospital, and sparked major questions about the safety of the increasingly popular endurance sport in china. within hours, the temperature on the mountain in north-westernchinawould drop far below zero. runners were pelted with rain, hail and gale-force winds. competitors have described being blindsided by the cold, losing feeling in their extremities, passing people who retired early and were descending the track, and coming across others who were foaming at the mouth or lying motionless. among those who died during the huanghe shilin mountain marathon in gansu’syellow river stone forest was record-holder liang jing, last photographed leading the pack, wearing shorts and a thin jacket. nicknamed liang god, the 31-year-old father of a two-year-old was well known in china as a champion racer. he was experienced, having won – among others – a 250-mile (400km) race through the gobi desert in 2018. according to china news weekly, he was one of four competitors who sheltered in a cave, accompanied by two local villagers. by the time rescuers found them, three of the four, including liang, had died. paralympian huang ganjun also died during the race. hearing- and speech-impaired, huang won the men’s hearing-impaired marathon at the 2019 national paralympic games. a friend described him as a “sensitive” man whose greatest joy in life was running. fellow competitor zhang xiaotao described seeing huang between the two checkpoints, alive and continuing but “in bad shape”. the gansu ultramarathon had been run three times before, but this was a new route, through remote mountain territory. the weather deteriorated between the second and third checkpoints: a five-mile stretch of trail, 15 miles into the route. competitors have variously described it as a treacherous and technical part of the route with 1,000 metres of elevation, requiring some climbing. “there is nowhere to rest and you can’t stop and the exposed mountains … but on this day, the problems were magnified,” the anonymous competitor said. wang jin-ming, 42, was among the runners who ended up in hospital. he told china news the weather turned at about 1pm, after he had run 17 miles. he struggled for 20 minutes to open his emergency blanket, only for it to be ripped out of his hands by the wind. he repeatedly pressed his gps emergency button."
"“i lost control of my hands and feet, i could only crawl, keep climbing, keep climbing … i told myself that i can’t stop, must keep up my body temperature, stay alive, and see my family.” wang said he found six or seven others, also in dire straits, and he urged them to keep moving but they couldn’t. at some point he lost consciousness and woke up in hospital. rescuers hadn’t reached him until about 7pm. the inaccessibility of the section meant checkpoint 3 was not a supply drop for food, water or warm clothes, and those caught in the section could only rely on what they were carrying, which for many was very little. across running forums and articles and media reports, many have questioned the lack of cold weather gear on the mandatory equipment list. a windbreaker or thermal top were only recommended, and the mandatory emergency blankets were ripped to shreds by the winds. but no one raised any objections to the list, wrote the anonymous competitor. “my jacket was packed in a transfer bag and stored at the [checkpoint 6] changing point 62km into the track. normally, i can get here before dark.” few made it past checkpoint 3. estimates say 40 to 50 people took shelter in small cabins or caves along the route, some helped by dozens of locals including a shepherd, zhu keming, who has beenhailed as a national herofor saving six people. wang qinlin, the party secretary of hu ma shui village, said he coordinated with a neighbouring village secretary and marshalled residents to gather winter coats, quilts, steamed buns and hot water for survivors. as the global ultramarathon community mourns its biggest ever tragedy, many are debating the role of personal responsibility. the sport is an ultimate endurance test, often in difficult or treacherous conditions. races can, and often do, go sideways for competitors at any moment along the trails of 60 miles plus. “trail running is the same as mountain climbing,” said chinese mountaineer luo jing, who survived the race. “you have to make plans for the worst case every time, and don’t pin your hopes on others.” luo put her survival partly down to preparation, bringing warm clothes and ensuring she had time to descend when the weather worsened. commentators have also suggested the explosion in the popularity of endurance running in china has led to thousands of race events, with too few experienced outfits to run them. often tourism officials see a race as a high-profile way to promote their region and to win favour with their superiors, potentially without enough regard for the danger. accounts in the chinese media have hinted at inadequate contingency plans, and poor communication to local rescue authorities, who struggled to access the terrain and locate stranded competitors. there is conflicting information about what weather was predicted, and what information was assessed and passed on by organisers."
"areport published in esquire, piecing together a timeline of events, revealed shambolic coordination of the rescue effort, with small teams and cars trying to reach checkpoints 2 and 4, while others including local villagers went on foot. there were several hours between the first messages for help and the full deployment of rescue teams. the incident is under investigation, and china’s sports governing body has already ordered improvements, saying there were “problems and deficiencies” in the management model for races, including contingency planning. numerous scheduled races have been cancelled in the fallout, and families of some of the victims have demanded accountability for the deaths. media reports of authorities preventing families from talking to each other, or of stopping families from taking the bodies back to their home towns, has only compounded worries. the anonymous runner said it was unheard of that most of the runners had dropped out of the race before organisers finally suspended it, and urged future competitors to be prepared to look after themselves in an emergency. “you can only say you’ve finished if you make it home. safety always come first.”"
"zhu keming rescued runners during cross-country mountain race in which 21 other competitors died a shepherd has been hailed as a hero inchinaafter it emerged that he saved six stricken runners during an ultramarathon in which 21 other competitors died. zhu keming was trending on weibo on tuesday, three days after a 100km (60-mile) cross-country mountain race in the north-western province of gansu turned deadly in freezing rain, high winds and hail. the incident triggered outrage and mourning in china, as questions swirled over why organisers apparently ignored warnings about the incoming extreme weather. zhu was grazing his sheep on saturday around lunchtime when the wind picked up, the rain came down and temperatures plunged, he told state media. he sought refuge in a cave where he had stored clothes and food for emergencies but while inside spotted one of the race’s 172 competitors and checked to see what was wrong because he was standing still, apparently suffering cramps. zhu escorted the man back to the cave, massaged his freezing hands and feet, lit a fire and dried his clothes. four more distressed runners made it into the cave and told the shepherd others were marooned outside, some unconscious. zhu headed outside once more and, braving hail and freezing temperatures, reached a runner lying on the ground. he carried him towards the shelter and wrapped him in blankets, almost certainly saving his life. “i want to say how grateful i am to the man who saved me,” the runner, zhang xiaotao, wrote on weibo. “without him, i would have been left out there.” zhu has been feted in china for his selfless actions, but the shepherd told state media that he was “just an ordinary person who did a very ordinary thing”. zhu rescued three men and three women, but regrets that he was unable to do more to help others who reportedly succumbed to hypothermia. “there were still some people that could not be saved,” he said. “there were two men who were lifeless and i couldn’t do anything for them. i’m sorry.” the tragedy has thrown a renewed spotlight on the booming marathon and running industry in china, with authorities ordering organisers of events to improve safety. according to the paper in shanghai, five cross-country, marathon or other running races have been cancelled at short notice."
"race organisers accused of not heeding warnings after rain, hail, and gale-force winds forecast across gansu province chinese authorities have launched an investigation intothe death of 21 people in an ultramarathonover the weekend, as family and friends of the competitors who died in the freezing weather questioned how it was allowed to happen. a further eight runners were injured when extreme weather hit the 100km (62 miles) high-altitude race in yellow river stone forest near baiyin in north-western gansu province. more than 700 rescuers were sent in with thermal imaging drones and radar detectors to find the 172 competitors who were running with little protective clothing other than emergency foil blankets, some of which were reportedly shredded by high winds. local authorities have launched an investigation, while observers blamed race organisers, accusing them of not heeding weather forecasts for the province, which is often hit by extreme weather conditions. in a report on friday, the provincial meteorological bureau had issued warnings for “sudden heavy showers, hail, lightning, [and] sudden gale-force winds” across gansu. state media reported temperatures plunging far below zero, pelting runners with rain, hail and sleet. in response to the tragedy, china’s sports governing body ordered improvements in safety managements in national sport events, including detailed contingency plans for incidents and measures for emergency cancellations, saying there were “problems and deficiencies” in the management model for races. among the dead were elite runners, including the 31-year-old record-holder liang jing, who leaves behind a two-year-old daughter, and the paralympian huang ganjun. liang had won a number of chinese ultramarathons in recent years while huang won the men’s hearing-impaired marathon at the 2019 national paralympic games. “i’m still stunned by the news. how could this happen? i can not believe it,” liang’s father told media. of the lead six competitors, only one – zhang xiaotao – reportedly survived. in a post on weibo, zhang described overtaking huang, who was both speech and hearing impaired, on the mountain as the weather began to turn. he also described running with wu pan-rong who was in fifth place, for a time, supporting each other before they were separated. wu is also reported to be among the dead. zhang said he fell several times, and at one point “could not get up”. he said he covered himself with the emergency blanket and set off his gps locator before passing out. he said he was rescued by a shepherd who had wrapped him in a blanket and carried him to a nearby cave, where several other runners were sheltering. after he regained consciousness, they descended the mountain together. “as a participant, i would like to pay my deepest condolence to my fellow runners who have passed away. may they rest in peace. my utmost appreciation to the shepherd. i would have died if he has not saved me. what he has done will never be forgotten.” the incident has prompted outrage on social media. related weibo hashtags and message threads have been viewed more than 120m times, with some calling it a “man-made disaster”."
"“it is suffocating to know that this could had been avoided. it is purely a man-made tragedy,” said a story reporting huang’s death. at a news briefing on sunday, baiyin officials bowed and apologised, saying they were saddened by the tragic deaths of the runners and that they were to be blamed."
"marathon runner eddie izzard, solo sailor pip hare and explorer levison wood explain what they have learned about enduring the seemingly unendurable it just goes on and on, doesn’t it? despite the millions of vaccinations, and boris johnson’s“roadmap” for easing the lockdown, this pandemic is feeling increasingly like an endurance test – a marathon, followed by another marathon, followed by another. or trudging for miles and miles across the desert for day after day. or sailing alone around the world, battling storms and loneliness. how do you keep going? there are people who know a thing or two about that – keeping going, endurance, deserts and storms. perhaps they might even have some advice. eddie izzard is in copenhagen when i speak to her. actually she’s not – she’s in london, at the riverside studios in hammersmith – but she’s kind of pretending to be in copenhagen. there’s a changing gallery of pictures of the danish capital up on a screen. her latest monster marathon challenge was to run one every day for 31 days, (sort of) in a different city every day, but really on a treadmill, because of lockdown. she called ita run for hope, to encourage people all over the world to unite to make humanity great again. oh, and as if a marathon a day wasn’t enough, she did a standup show after each one. i didn’t realise i’d be zooming eddie while she was running – or that i would be part ofher live podcast/broadcast. if i had, i would have worn a new t-shirt. but she finds it useful to talk while she runs – it helps to focus the brain away from what the legs and the lungs are going through. she talked to people – famous people, normal people, the odd journalist – throughout. “if you have to form an answer in your head, it just pulls me up and out, and i can keep going at this speed, 7.5 kilometres an hour, hacking away at the time for 6½ hours.” she’s about two hours into today’s run, looking comfortable, in red joggers, trackie top and make humanity great again baseball cap, chatting away in that languid, liquid way of hers, sliding almost imperceptibly between subjects. that – talking – is something we all need to keep doing to help us through the pandemic. “on facetime, whatsapp, whatever, with your friends, like you used to. have a beer with them, sit down and have a meal with them while they’re having a meal – you can do that,” she says. one big difference between her month of marathons and everyone’s slog through the pandemic is that her ordeal is more clearly finite. but even so, we should be thinking about the end. “you’ve got to be planning things now. we know from all the other horrible pandemics through history that they do stop. i’d say plan for that.” and exercise, of course, for physical and mental health."
"“get out, especially if it’s a sunny, crisp winter’s day.” izzard believes stamina might be both acquired and in-built. the terminator gene, she calls it. “coming out as tv/trans in 1985 was a tough mental fight – it was very toxic, the idea of being trans then. so if you can do that and come through and create a small space of calmness around yourself, then everything else doesn’t seem that hard. the first 10 marathons are hellish and then it gets a little bit better – not fantastically better, a little bit better. you know what you’re doing.” what do we do to build up our stamina? dial m for motivation. “if you’re not motivated, you won’t do anything; if you are, you’ll do lots,” she says. “this is probably the easiest one if you want to do something healthy: put a date in your diary when you say you’re going to go and do something. tell everyone you’re going to do it and then do it.” and do it for charity, raise some money. “then you feel motivated that you’re helping other people. that’s the simplest way of doing something positive, and the stamina will come because you’re motivated. i’ve told everyone i’m going to do this; i can’t let them down.” when i speak by phone to pip hare, she’s in the atlantic, somewhere off the coast of brazil. she’s taking part in the vendée globe, the toughest race in sailing, alone around the world. “i’ve just been up the mast again,” she says, cheerfully. she doesn’t like climbing the mast, not because she’s scared of heights but because she’s aware of the danger. “thirty metres up in the air on a moving boat in the middle of the atlantic is an incredibly vulnerable situation,” she says, and she laughs. how does she keep going? “you need to accept that there are highs and lows, there are times when you can forge forward and times when you’re fire-fighting. you need to understand which time you’re in, take control of the environment so that you feel you are moving forward.” objectives are important. “there has to be a deep reason why you want to do something, because you’re putting yourself mentally and physically through really tough times. you’re asking yourself to pick yourself up and carry on every time you get knocked down. to have the strength to do that, i think you need to know why.” so for her there is a sporting objective: she’s a sailor, she aspires to be the best she can in her sport. “but on a deeper level, as a human being, it makes me curious how far i can push myself. there is always going to be something to learn, something i can do better in every walk of my life. that’s what drives me on, understanding not who you are but who you want to be.” hare can see some parallels between her situation and being in lockdown. she’s in a small environment; she can’t see her friends and family."
"“it’s hard because we are so used to having a life that runs itself, all of these external stimuli that encourage the behaviours that get us through the day-to-day. when they get taken away we need to replace them with something that comes from us.” any tips? “some really simple stuff. go outside every single day – it really makes a difference. natural light is the most incredible mood-changer. exercise, obviously, as well. just do something positive for yourself every day – it doesn’t matter what but something that makes you feel proud of yourself. and it’s a really good time to just reflect on where you want to be when this is all over. and keep in contact with people, not just for you but for them.” at the start of her solo circumnavigation, she got loads of texts from well-meaning people asking how she was. “over and over again: ‘how are you?’ that’s not helpful. it’s actually quite exhausting when all anybody wants to know is how are you – no effort for them and high effort for me.” she told them she wanted to hear their news, what they were watching, listening to, something funny that happened. “that’s what we’re all missing, that everyday interaction. occasionally just drop someone a random text – there doesn’t have to be a reason, just tell them something about your life. it makes me feel so much more engaged and closer to my friends.” hare’s adventure will finish a couple of weeks after we speak; she has mixed feelings. it will be the completion of an extraordinary achievement – she will have proved herself, to herself as well as others. but none of her family or friends will be able to come and meet her in les sables-d’olonne, in western france. “i’ve sailed round the world on my own and i can’t hug anyone – that’s really going to hurt.” it’s going to be a case of adapting. “‘i’ve thought quite hard about what i’m going to do. i already have some mini-objectives for 2021. and i can tell you when lockdown is lifted and we are finally allowed to gather in groups, there’s going to be one hell of a party in poole.” right now, though, she has got to go on deck to change a sail. when levison wood walked the length of the river nile seven years ago, from source to sea, it sometimes felt as if the journey would never end. he remembers one low point in particular. “i had reached the sahara desert in sudan; it wasn’t even halfway and i’d already been walking for six months at that stage. i looked ahead and all i could see was endless sand.” earlier in the trip, matthew power, an american journalist who had come out to walk with and write about wood,had suddenly died of heatstroke. “all these things were weighing on my mind."
"to be confronted with just monotony was a really tough thing to deal with.” wood is speaking today not from the nile, but from his home near the banks of the thames at hampton court. he has found lockdown tough, stuck at home. he broke his ankle; his dog died. “that’s really hard to deal with. but when something like that happens it’s a case of: well, right, this is shit but what’s good? or what could be better?” he began to explore – the local park. “it’s been an opportunity to connect with my local area. i’d probably only been in bushy park three or four times, and suddenly i was finding these hidden gardens and things, glorious little discoveries.” and he’s been using the time to write a book, the art ofexploration, reflecting on his travels, what he has learned from them and how it can be applied in daily life. like izzard and hare, wood talks of the importance of helping others. a paras veteran, he volunteered for an ex-services charity called re:act, helping the nhs, working in a mortuary in hounslow. “i was stacking bodies in march and april last year. that brought it home, that this disease was clearly going to kill a lot of people. but i felt i needed to go and do my bit.” being in the army helped him build not just resilience but patience. “half of what you do in the army is sitting around waiting for something to happen, it’s not all bangs and action. i was in afghanistan in 2008, and while there was plenty of action it was still about 80% sitting on your arse doing nothing. it does engender a sense of resilience and patience and keeping some kind of hope that things will improve. the same keeping hope alive can be applied to the current situation.” on his big walks (as well as the nile, he has walked the length of the himalayas, central america and the arabian peninsula) there has needed to be a natural process of resignation. “there is no point trying to change the situation – you have to try to change the way you deal with it, find a new sense of purpose from a different routine. if you’re stuck at home that means having a routine that structures your day, whether that’s doing a bit of yoga in the morning, or mindfulness, just changing your habits a bit.” it’s all too easy to fall into bad habits, “maybe having a few too many glasses of vino every night. it’s about reminding yourself that you’ve got to stay on top of things and be as positive as you can. the way i do that is by trying to remind myself of what we have to be grateful for – i know it’s a bit of a cliche, but it really does help.” walks, lockdowns, it doesn’t matter – it’s the same. on the nile he constantly reminded himself that no matter how tough it was for him, he was just a visitor."
"“looking around, there was extreme poverty, there was conflict, people living in dire circumstances, often struggling to get clean water. when i remind myself that actually i’ve got nothing to complain about, shift my mindset a little bit to think of it that way, then things aren’t as bad as they seem.” suddenly even miles and miles of endless sand – actual sand or the metaphorical desert of lockdown – doesn’t look so bad."
"the book born to run brought attention to an indigenous mexican’s people feats of long-distance running. a new documentary looks at what happened next next up in espn’s venerable 30 for 30 series isthe infinite race, a documentary on a sports topic that hardly checks the biggest 30 for 30 box, in that the film does not involve a famous star athlete, sport or event. in fact, the infinite race kicks off with a simple story about an indigenous people’s joy of long-distance running. the documentary explores what happens to these people,the tarahumara, who live deep in the mountains of chihuahua, mexico, when their love of running, or even their calling to run, spills out to the rest of the world because of a popular book about running and an american known as caballo blanco, or the white horse. “it’s a story about resilience, survival and continuance,”bernardo ruiz, the veteran mexican and american film-maker who directed the infinite race, tells the guardian. that the 50-mile ultra maratón caballo blanco, which the infinite race revolves around, will be held again next march in the rugged terrain ofchihuahua’s copper canyonis a testament to the event’s durability. running won out, as it has for generations among the tarahumara, but only after the event survived a culture clash that involved a lot of dollars and pesos, good and bad. although he directed an award-winning 2008 documentary about baseball star roberto clemente and says he always wanted to make a film about running, ruiz deals with tougher subjects, like the us-mexico drug war in his 2016 documentary kingdom of shadows. he says of the infinite race: “i liked how it was a compelling, beautiful film about running, but it also talked about social issues.” the film, which debuts on 15 december, starts a little slowly, but those who stick with it will find out much about an indigenous people’s rich past – and a future lighted by hope. the tarahumara, or the rarámuri, have run vast distances for years, often wearing sandals that have tire treads as soles. they say running is in their blood: isolation and geography helped them build endurance to hunt prey. they became famous after they were featured inborn to run, a 2009 bestseller by christopher mcdougall. the central figure of born to run was american ultramarathon runner micah true, also known as caballo blanco, who organized a race in 2003 that would eventually become the ultra maratón caballo blanco. true hoped the race would help the tarahumara preserve their running heritage and, more significantly, their culture, which had been battered by hunger, a lack of drinking water, a shortage of housing and global heating. true, who had wintered in the area for 10 years, offered prizes of cash and corn, a commodity: “i don’t want to see people kill themselves for corn,” he said in the documentary. he opened the event to ultramarathoners, and it became popular among americans, who were looking for a new challenge and a new culture to explore."
"true died in 2012 at the age of 58 of a heart attack while running, but the event named after him continued to grow. a shorter kids’ run for “caballitos” was offered, with bags of school supplies given to participants. the event had become commercialized, even with its own line of merchandise, but the whole region benefited from caballo blanco’s idea. but the region’s seclusion had also become attractive to criminal gangs, who took over farms to grow marijuana and poppy plants to smuggle into the united states, whose border is only about 550 miles to the north. people needed work, and the drug trade provided opportunities, with even distance runners hauling drugs. gangs proliferated. so did violence. “many families were forced out of their communities because of the violence,” irma chávez, an activist, explains in the film. “unfortunately, you have to run away before they kill you.” the 2015 ultra maratón caballo blanco was supposed to be the biggest yet, but gangs all but took over the town, clouding the event with the real threat of violence. the americans who helped organize the race, believing participants could be in danger, decided almost at the last minute to call off the official race. no vouchers for corn would be issued to participants. “they kind of intruded with a heavy hand into a runner’s paradise,” ruiz says of the gangs. he says, “it’s been my view that the race organizers were stuck in kind of an impossible situation.” and that might have been the end of the event. but a group of tarahumara assembled on what was supposed to be the morning of the race – and ran the course anyway, without incident. the marathon was officially back in 2017. miguel lara viniegras won the 2020 race, which attracted 220 runners last march, in six hours 43 minutes. as an ultrarunner and photographer luis escobar says in the film, “people are looking for something big, outside of their office, outside of their home. it is a big struggle, it’s hard physically and mentally – and there’s nothing like doing it. when you complete it, you know that you can do anything.” ruiz, who says he spent most of his career examining the love-hate relationship between the united states and mexico, had a compelling challenge: telling a story that was not that well-known and based in a place that was very difficult to get to from the outside world. “you’d have to kind of be an ultrarunner or a sports geek to care about it,” he says. perhaps the film won’t draw as big an audience as other espn documentaries because it does not include an american sports celebrity like oj simpson or michael jordan. but the 30 for 30 project, now more than a decade old, has become much deeper, delivering quality projects that are way more than mere sports movies. this is one. as ruiz says, 30 for 30 “is a franchise that is really film-maker-driven.”"
"as rest of uk slowed down, serious runners used the time to train harder and smash records while many of us spent a lot of time doing very little during the coronavirus lockdown, for a niche pocket of society it provided an opportunity to push themselves to the limits of physical endurance. whileultrarunnersalso had less to do, with no races to train for, lockdown became an ideal opportunity to complete goals they had long hankered after, resulting in a number of world records being broken in the past few weeks alone. sabrina verjee becamethe first woman to run the wainwrights round, a mere 318 miles (512km), while kim collisonbroke the lakes 24-hour challenge recordthat had stood for 23 years. then came beth pascall, whosmashed the previous bob graham recordheld byjasmin paris. meanwhile, damian hall set a new record time on the 268-mile pennine way – while also cleaning the trail of litter – and earlier this week, carla molinaro set a new women’s world record by running from land’s end to john o’ groats in 12 days, 30 minutes and 14 seconds. molinaro and hall say the pandemic and subsequent lockdown gave them the impetus to finally complete goals that had been on their bucket lists for years. molinaro, 36, a running coach, started out at land’s end at 5am on 16 july.runningnearly 73 miles every day and fuelled by macaroni cheese, cakes, some cocktail sausages and a few pitstops at b&bs, she didn’t even take a break to celebrate her 36th birthday. “the weather was brutal towards the end – 30mph winds and driving rain,” she said. “and then i couldn’t run on the last day because i was in so much pain and we had to walk the last bit, but we somehow got through it,” she said, as she was being driven back home to buckinghamshire by her sister, andrea, after completing the challenge. despite getting blisters and having to have her toenails drilled, molinaro, whose parents were marathon runners, took more than 10 hours off the previous record of 12 days, 11 hours and 6 minutes, set by the north yorkshire runner sharon gayter last august. molinaro, who represented great britain at the 100km world championships and whose previous challenges include running 170km around mont blanc, began training for the feat on the driveway of her family home in south africa. “right at the beginning i was stuck in south africa and we weren’t allowed to go out anywhere so i just started to do laps of the driveway – the neighbours thought i was mad,” said the former british army operations officer. “but all races were cancelled and the pressure of training for them had been suddenly taken away. it gave me that time to do those things which had been on my bucket list for a while, but this ended up being one of the hardest things i have ever done.” molinaro, whose inspiration included the endurance athlete mimi anderson, a previous record holder of the challenge, said it had been an “awesome” year for ultrarunners."
"“funny, really, that we clearly all had the same thought process. and then we all made it happen and went for the records at the same time. we smashed it and didn’t just give up and sit on the couch, which was obviously tempting.” hall agrees with molinaro. the 44-year-old completed the pennine way in 61 hours 34 minutes, knocking more than three hours off the record set by his friend, the us ultrarunner john kelly, just a week earlier. before that, it had stood unbeaten for 31 years, belonging to mike hartley. “this had been on the radar for me for about four years but i’d always been intimidated by how good the previous record was so i kept making excuses, but then lockdown happened and i ran out of excuses,” says hall. the father-of-two from wiltshire completed the record run at 7.34pm on friday in edale, derbyshire, having started at 6am on wednesday in kirk yetholm, scottish borders. his route along great britain’s oldest national trail amassed more ascent than mount everest and included a section along hadrian’s wall. the climate-change campaigner, whose whole attempt was certified as “carbon negative” by our carbon, used the challenge to help raise funds for greenpeace uk. he and his 11 teams of pacers also cleaned the famous trail of litter as they ran, stuffing it in their packs before handing it to support team members at road crossing meet-up points. “i feel tired and satisfied,” says hall, who headed straight to the pub for his first pint in four months after completing the challenge. “lockdown gave me the opportunity to start enjoying running for the sake of running again. i have flown around the world doing challenges and this made me realise sometimes we overlook what we have here.”"
"what drives a group of people to run around the same new york block 5,649 times? sanjay rawal’s new film takes a look at the world’s longest certified footrace and the bliss of extreme running you might think that running around the samenew yorkcity block for 52 days straight would be an exercise in futility. not to mention stupefyingly boring. runners who signed up for the self-transcendence 3100 mile race would go around and around 164th street in jamaica, queens, 5,649 times, roughly 96km each day until they had run 4,898km in the world’s longest certified footrace. the race – and extreme running itself – is the subject of sanjay rawal’s new film, 3100 run and become, which is now available to stream. watching it now – as the world’s major cities including new york are in shutdown – feels jarring, a reminder of the freedoms we have lost: to be outside in bustling streets, where people move with purpose; to run and to breathe without fear. in the film, street life in queens surrounds the runners as they circle the same block, past the thomas edison high school and joseph austin playground, again and again. they struggle with the stifling summer heat bouncing off the pavement, the humidity, the blisters, the chafing, the carb loading, the exhaustion. the race was founded in 1996 by the late indian guru sri chinmoy as a way for people to discover – and surpass – their own limits. the goal is to transcend earthly annoyances and find some kind of enlightenment. but for the most part in this film, those taking part look more as though they are descending into a particularly unpleasant version of hell, as their muscles break down. ashprihanal aalto, 45, tells his mentor that after winning in 2015 he doesn’t want to run the race again because he doesn’t want to suffer like that any more. but he does run it, as he has 15 times now, winning more than half of them. “i wouldn’t do it 15 years if there wasn’t something more than just a race,” he tells the guardian. “for me it is part of my spiritual life … you try to quiet the mind.” he was training for this year’s race when it was cancelled because of the coronavirus. now he’s self-isolating instead: a situation he’s better trained for than most. aalto speaks to me from helsinki,finland, where he is a postal worker, living an austere existence alone in a cabin. “these types of races are not for an incredibly social person” says the director, rawal. “i would say his life of utter solicitude definitely gives him an edge over people. [aalto] lives like a teenager, he has got boxes of chocolate under his bed. he drinks soda all the time, eats pizza. the one thing he works on his mental attitude, just to keeping his mind fluid, loose and free.” the most interesting thing about those who run this race, rawal says, is that they are “the most ordinary people”."
"“one of them, yuri [trostenyuk, who won in 2016], is a plumber in the ukraine. none of them are sponsored. it shows that if you have the right attitude you can accomplish what most people think is impossible.” aalto found spirituality after his mother died. craving time and space to reflect, he went into the forest on his own for three months, walking the 4,500km pacific crest trail and then the 3,500km appalachian trail in the us. “after many months of hiking you become one with the forest and more sensitive, your hearing and smell becomes better,” he says. when he heard about multi-day races, something clicked: “i thought it sounded nice to be able to run all day and night.” in his film, rawal explores the spirituality of running as it’s experienced around the world; that ability to tap into something more powerful than simply the pounding of feet. “it was this idea that running could be a prayer,” he says. he ventures from the new york race to visit shaun martin, a navajo canyon runner in chinle, arizona, who is continuing a tradition of moving on foot that has existed for hundreds of years. he visits bushmen of botswana, who are trying to hold on to a now-illegal tradition of hunting by running after their prey. he also talks to a buddhist monk in mount hiei, japan, who undertakes an ascetic 1,000-day challenge in rugged terrain wearing unsuitable bamboo shoes – and who is obliged to kill himself if he doesn’t complete it. says rawal of the monk: “it was this idea that movement and running could be used to totally transcend our ego and put us into the highest realms of spiritual consciousness. that there comes a point that the bliss totally negates any pain or discomfort. if it wasn’t for the bliss all he would think about was, ‘what if i don’t finish?’, and fear would envelope him.” aalto says: “for some people it is spiritual music or great singers that gives their joy, their inspiration, for some people art. for me running long distances is my way of making progress, that is what keeps me motivated. as the years go by the more it is an inner thing. it is still a race but there is a kind of joy in it.” 3100: run and become is streaming on itunes, amazon, amazon prime and google play"
"when noé álvarez joined an extraordinary ultramarathon he tested himself physically and mentally, while also connecting with his heritage while jogging on the spot, mexican-american runner noé álvarez showed his passport to the border agent in nogales, arizona. álvarez was participating in thepeace and dignity journeys(pdj), an ultramarathon for runners of indigenous background like himself. his group had run 3,200 miles from the arctic to the us border with mexico. they still had miles to go before their destination of the panama canal, but for álvarez, the crossing into mexico had extra meaning – it was the homeland of his parents before they immigrated to the us. the border agent, a fellow latino, smirkingly asked if he was running in the wrong direction. it’s an emotional moment inálvarez’s new memoir, spirit run: a 6,000-mile marathon through north america’s stolen land. the book chronicles not only that epic run in 2004 but also the background of the author and his immigrant parents. “i feel like i’m still writing it,” álvarez says. “it continues to inform my life. it took me years to figure out how i was going to tell it.” ultimately, he decided on uniting the beauty of the journey and the messy moments along the way “through the medium of running.” and what a run it was. the pdj is a quadrennial event intended to reconnect indigenous participants with their ancestral land, with the latest edition, which had been due to take place this year, postponed due to the covid-19 outbreak. in 2004, álvarez’s group was heading south to rendezvous with another group running north from argentina. “we ran beyond trying to burn calories,” álvarez says. “those [kind of] runners didn’t last. it’s bigger, larger than yourself … before you knew it, 10, 15, 20 [miles a day] was easy,” although, he clarifies, “we were hurting afterward.” there were unexpected difficulties -- an encounter between álvarez and a mountain lion in oregon, stone-throwing motorists in mexico, and tensions between the author and some of his fellow runners. and he didn’t quite finish the way he intended to. but the first-time author has come to find satisfaction in both the run and his life trajectory. álvarez grew up in yakima, washington, the son of mexican immigrants ofpurépechaheritage. his father worked in an orchard, his mother at an apple-packing plant. as a teenager, he worked with his mother at the plant, describing the days as physically demanding; he said his mother is starting to lose sensation in her hands from overwork. he also started to run, although he grew up thinking of it as a way to keep one step ahead of immigration authorities. he received a full scholarship to whitman college in walla walla, washington, but says he felt “cultural shock on all sorts of levels. i had difficulties, there was the shame of failing, i could not save my family.” serendipitously, he learned of the pdj from “a friend of a friend of a friend.” “i had to do this,” álvarez explains. “it was part of my escape."
"i was not connected to college at the time. it was not how i needed to learn. college was joining the run.” he joined one month in, after the group had started its journey from alaska. their paths crossed in british columbia. fellow runners collectively represented nine indigenous communities. “it was interesting to see how fluid and multilayered our identities were,” he says of his fellow participants, whom he portrays through composite characters in the book. they included runners of mexican heritage living in canada, and “an elder, our spiritual guide, from the arctic.” he noted that there were “some former gang and military members and others completely living off the land,” and women runners committed to “female energy, healing power, balance.” pdj runners start and end each day with a ceremony, and carry feathered staffs during the run. daily destinations are indigenous communities across north america. at each stop, community members share an important cultural story with the runners, signifying the story with a feather to add to the staff. sometimes they also shared running traditions, including running as a group in the tohono o’odham territory in the arizona desert. álvarez, who had never run more than 10 miles in a day, would receive myriad tests. the pdj takes place relay-style, with each runner committing to a certain amount of mileage each day while others wait their turn while traveling by motor vehicle. he learned to eat on the run, finding that a hard-boiled egg stuffed into his pocket might not be the wisest nourishment with wildlife around. he and his fellow runners slept in all manner of venues, from campgrounds to casinos, and encountered varying terrain, from the forests of canada to the deserts of washington and arizona to the jungles of mexico. “it was not just running blindly,” álvarez says. “it’s a story about why land is important to people.” he noted that in the canadian forests, trees were being cut down for the ski industry and the winter olympics, while more arid areas were suffering from drought. “we honored the land that a lot of people depend on,” álvarez says. “we were physically walking, running and connecting with it every step of the way.” in oregon, he made an unexpected connection – a mountain lion waiting for him atop a peak. “i was completely unprepared,” álvarez recalls. “i couldn’t run back. i had to keep moving forward.” he says that when he joined the run, “one guy, a really good friend and spiritual guide, talked about how to be thankful for the presence of an animal that decides to notice you, sort of take it as a message, an opportunity to reflect.” in the book, álvarez describes the mix of gratitude and footwork that helped him escape the big cat. “luckily, i’m still here,” he says. “i did some studies on what you’re supposed to do, and they said definitely don’t run."
"it’s definitely the dumbest thing i probably ever did.” after the group crossed into mexico, they encountered a different kind of danger: people who threw rocks from cars. female runners were also at risk of assault; álvarez describes one attempt that left some runners wary of continuing. “we came across situations with real shady encounters, people trying to force you into a vehicle, throw rocks at you, who didn’t want you there,” álvarez says. “we adjusted, ran in pairs … some territories were extremely unsafe. if you didn’t want to run, you didn’t have to. others took on the miles.” ultimately, it was a familiar runner’s story – injury – that determined álvarez would finished his run in guatemala before he could reach the panama canal. he calls it “the toughest decision, probably, i ever had to make.” “i didn’t want to quit,” he says. “but knowing when to quit was part of the lesson.” this lesson has stayed with him ever since – as has the border officer’s question about whether he was running in the wrong direction. “i no longer think about the wrong direction,” álvarez says. “i have a line of inquiry now, a ritual of asking the questions i need to.” and, he says, “running is the way i process things now.”"
"from swimming the channel four times to outrunning every man, we meet the women at the top of their game the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. at the top of a wind-scoured hill outside edinburgh, jasmin paris’s dog, moss, patiently waits for his owner. he is, i think, wondering what on earth is taking her so long. the answer, i’m afraid, is me. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. we are in the pentland hills near her home – easy terrain for a skilled fell runner. for me, it’s a painful reminder that road marathons and track races do not help in the hills. i spend my clumsy descents looking at my feet, and each time i look up, paris is defying gravity – not so much dropping as floating down. in january, paris, then 35, made headlines across the globe when she won thespine race, one of those almost comically difficult events that sounds less like a run and more like a sadistic punishment: 268 miles, nonstop, along the pennine way. paris took a week off from her phd in veterinary science to compete, and thrashed every man in the field in the process. the race is billed as the world’s toughest endurance contest, and with good reason. it’s dark two-thirds of the time. racers traverse the peak district, yorkshire dales, north pennines and cross over hadrian’s wall to thecheviots, sleeping only in snatches. yet paris’s time of 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds beat her nearest male rival by nearly 15 hours. and she did it while expressing milk for her baby daughter in aid stations en route – ensuring more than her allotted 15 minutes of fame when she crossed the line. but it’s a fame she clearly finds a little baffling: it’s a fair bet no one has taken up fell running in a bid to become rich or famous. “that last day of the race, in the cheviots, was so remote and so, so beautiful,” she tells me. where we are in the pentlands feels fairly remote on a windy day, but it is only a bus ride from edinburgh town centre. “i think i saw one person in about 10 hours. it was one of those mountain days that you remember for ever. i had stopped thinking about the outside world. it’s a simple existence: you put one foot in front of the other and keep going. emerging from the darkness to what came after – the whole world seemingly wanting to talk to you – was such a stark contrast. but that wasn’t the reason i wanted to do it. it was a challenge, a personal challenge.” the thing is, i think that might be why she won. when it comes to speed, men will always be first across the line. no woman will outsprint usain bolt."
"no woman will hit the side of the pool ahead of michael phelps’s world records. yet a remarkable phenomenon seems to have gathered pace over the past few years: the longer and more brutal the event, the more women seem to be winning outright, or surpassing men’s achievements. in september this year, the us swimmer sarah thomas (already holder of the world record for the longest open-water swim) completed anotherbreathtaking feat of endurance. the channel swimming association records 1,652 solo, observed, unassisted swims (no neoprene wetsuits or flotation devices) of the channel since 1875. thirty-four people have swum it there and back without stopping. four people have swum it three times in a row (two men, two women). but only one – thomas – has swum it four times. it took her 54 hours and 10 minutes, and though the crossing at its narrowest point is 20 miles, because of the strong tides pushing against her, she actually swam not 80 but close to 130 miles. this was despite battling nausea and throwing up everything she ate for the first two crossings. a day into her swim, she was almost ready to bail, but her team told her: just keep going. “so that’s what i did,” she said. “i swam until the sun came up and i started to feel better.” it’s not only paris and thomas. last month maggie guteri became the first woman to win the peculiarly sadisticbig dog backyard ultrain tennessee. the distance is not even set – it’s a case of last man or woman standing. she ran for 60 hours and covered 250 miles. this year, german cyclist fiona kolbinger won thetranscontinentalrace – 2,485 miles across europe. and in 2018, british fell runner nicky spinks set a record for the course in the lake district known as thedouble bob graham round(one circuit of 42 fells, 66 miles and 26,900ft of ascent isn’t enough). most of these women aren’t even full-time athletes: paris got up at 4am to fit her spine race training in. spinks is a farmer. kolbinger is a medical researcher. so what is going on here? are we witnessing the beginning of a brave new world, or are these extraordinary women simply outliers? those looking for a definitive scientific answer may be disappointed. until about the age of 10, girls and boys are, athletically speaking, the same. top running speed is the same for boys and girls, as is top swimming speed. then puberty happens and testosterone changes everything. by 14, boys have bigger hearts, stronger arms, bigger shoulders, longer limbs, greater muscle mass. more power, and more speed, for life. in 2010, israeli physicist ira hammerman set out to look at records in 82 different sports, ranging from running to speed skating, to see if there was a pattern to the resultant “performance gap”. in every sport, across every distance,a clear difference emerged: women’s speed records are about 9-11% slower than men’s. however, when it comes to very long endurance events, the data is limited."
"while ultrarunning is experiencing something of an explosion in popularity, there aren’t that many 200-mile-plus races, and relatively few women are running them. so is it not possible that after a certain mileage the relative advantages that male hormones bring just, well, run out? the renownedsports scientist ross tuckeris doubtful. he points out that the success rate among women in ultra-distance races is probably down to the fact that these are niche events – the tiny numbers of ultra-committed female athletes who do compete make any kind of analysis or extrapolation meaningless. however, intriguingly, he does wonder whether a woman’s body composition might prove to be an advantage when it comes to long-distance swimming. “the higher relative body fat percentage is probably enough to offset the differences in strength between men and women, particularly for cold water,” he says. a higher body fat percentage helps in buoyancy, which in turn reduces energy expenditure. it also helps insulate in cold water. then there’s the theory that women do so well in ultra races because they are better than men at burning fat for fuel – making them more efficient. but if that were true, tucker would expect the gap between the sexes to narrow as the reliance on fat gets larger – which doesn’t seem to be the case. “in running, from 100 metres to 90 kilometre ultramarathons, the gap between men and women doesn’t change,” he says. “that said, it could be that there is a kind of ‘inflection’ point where suddenly it begins to count. the data is just too thin to know for sure.” but if women win because of who else does or doesn’t turn up – how did paris do so by such a margin? after all, when she won the spine, the second-place finisher was eoin keith, a previous winner and the holder of the course record she smashed – hardly an average competitor. the answer may lie less in the body than in the head. paris doesn’t run for prizes. she – like thomas, who works for a healthcare company in colorado – is an amateur, with a full-time job. if every single fell race in the country were called off tomorrow, she’d still be up in those hills every day. she tells me about holidays spent there in her late teens and early 20s with her brother. they’d pack everything they needed to be self-sufficient for a week, go to the remotest hills and hike, eat, sleep, repeat. she hasn’t raced a huge amount since january’s spine race, but in the summer she, her husband and a friend completed the petite trotte à léon (ptl). part of ultrarunning’s biggest event – the ultra trail du mont blanc (utmb) – the ptl is not so much a race as an endurance adventure. the 300km route passes through france, italy and switzerland, and includes 25,000m of ascent. “it was kind of a holiday,” paris says, smiling. i suspect it’s not most people’s idea of a relaxing week."
"but it reminds me of a conversation i had with the cyclistemily chappell, who was the first woman across the line in the 2016 transcontinental, and has herself been pondering the question of what can lead to women outperforming men. “i’ve got this bee in my bonnet about the current narrative for cycling – the male narrative,” she says. “a lot of it is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain and seeking out pain. oh god, it’s so boring. so the working theory i’ve come up with is that people who do endurance sport are often people who have quite comfortable lives, and they are almost looking for pain elsewhere. i know it’s making generalisations, but what if men are looking for the pain they lack in life, and women are looking for the freedom?” it’s a persuasive theory. so many endurance events are marketed with a hefty dash of machismo – “tough” this, “ultimate” that, “warrior” the other. but is this constant reminder of suffering really the best way to approach an ultra event, when managing your head is as – if not more – important than managing your body? if you buy into this narrative that you are here only to suffer and endure, rather than have fun, then maybe those who start relaxed, looking forward to the journey, might have a head start. perhaps this sounds a little woolly. but thomas agrees that, for her, swimming is about freedom, not glory. “this is exactly me!” she says. “i don’t really care about racing and winning – i just like pushing myself. the long open-water swims make me feel free and strong. to look across the channel and say, ‘i swam that’ is really empowering. i love being alone in a large body of water, knowing i’m relying on myself to make it through.” dr josephine perry, a sports psychologist and author of performing under pressure, goes a step further. she believes women are better at dealing with pain. “eighty per cent of women get period pain at some point in their lives and around 10% have conditions like endometriosis, which can severely impact their ability to perform in sport,” she says. “if a large majority of women have developed strong coping mechanisms to deal with this regular pain, then the short-term pain they feel when running a race will fade in comparison.” sports psychologists also often talk about “the process, not the outcome” – enjoying, or at least staying in, the moment. thomas clearly embraces this. “i was always weird during my competitive swimming days. i loved the training more than the racing,” she says. perry believes this mindset can, perhaps contrary to expectations, create winners. “something i see regularly with athletes is that when you are expected to do well, it adds a significant pressure,” she explains. “when there are no expectations we relax and can enjoy the process of seeing what is possible, rather than worrying about failing."
"these women may well see the event as ‘just a race’ in which they can see what is possible, rather than openly and loudly setting out to win it. this can be incredibly beneficial to performance.” then there is the question of pride. even when women do not win outright, they often perform better than men: better, in that a higher proportion of women finish ultra events successfully. and ego – or rather a lack of one – may be a key factor. paris tells me about another infamous ultra race she ran in 2015, thedragon’s back: five days, 315km and 15,500m of ascent in the welsh mountains. “one of my role models is helene diamantides, one of the pioneers of women’s fell running. she said to us at the start of the race: look around the room. if you are a man, you have a 50% chance of finishing the race. if you’re a woman, you have a 90% chance. but then, there were far fewer women in the room. because they have less ego, they wouldn’t turn up unless they were well-prepared. whereas men can be a bit like, how hard can this be?” thomas agrees. “i think women do train harder, generally, and are less likely to wing something than the guys are,” she says. “i remember seeing something a few years ago that ran some numbers as related to speed. there are more guys who do longer swims, so there is a wider range of times, more variation. there are fewer women, but we seem to be more consistent.” it is backed up, too, by data from less extreme events. in marathon running, we know that women are on averagebetter pacers. not faster overall, just better at running evenly: less likely to go out too hard and “blow up”. and whether it’s 26.2 miles or 262, going out too hard can be the worst mistake you can make. “in something like the spine race, it’s not even just about being able to run a long way,” paris says. “it’s the fact that you need to look after yourself. you need to eat enough, feed yourself, look after your feet. i think sometimes the men, maybe their egos give them a single-mindedness and focus. but that’s almost a disadvantage, because actually, in an event that long you have to be able to multitask, to think about lots of things, to navigate [to look after yourself].” so having the biggest heart, and the highest oxygen uptake, might make you quickest over a certain distance but it won’t necessarily help you over days of endurance. yet as tucker suggests, if there is one sport in which women do narrow that performance gap it is ultra-endurance swimming. over distances of 16-36km, women are generally only 1-6% slower. and in two long-distance swims, thecatalina channel(32k) and themanhattan island marathon swim(45.9km) – both of which thomas has completed – the fastest women ever were faster than the best-performing men."
"as tucker suggests, perhaps women’s body fat and its more even distribution is an advantage – fat is buoyant so aids flotation. but thomas is not one to explore the theories. “i haven’t really looked into the science,” she says. “i just try to accept that my body is strong and can handle cold, no matter how much i hate my love handles.” of course, women beating men is hardly new. in any race, some women will finish faster than some men – there’s even a phrase for it in the athlete’s lexicon: being “chicked”. it is not something all men take well. even in my own career as a club runner, i’ve encountered a few who are clearly rankled by it, including a man who refused to let me run faster than him on a simple run commute home, to the point where he ended up throwing up under a tree because he’d pushed himself so hard. and i’ve also lost count of the number of races where the second half has been spent overtaking enthusiastic runners who set off too fast – 99% of them male. fortunately, hostility is the exception. thomas points out that swimming has a longer history of equality than most sports. “gertrude ederlewas the first woman to swim the channel in the late 1920s, while the first female to run a marathon didn’t come along until the 70s. so women swimmers have a decades-longer tradition of being accepted than runners do. “i think most men are in awe of the women they swim with,” she adds. “they seem to accept that we’re just as tough, just as fast. that said, there are always exceptions. i have trained with men who think and act like they can beat me and get their feelings hurt when i pass them. i was sharing a lane with some guys a few years ago. when i was passing them, they tried to obstruct me. when i was getting out, two of them yelled at me for not being ‘respectful’ of their workout, never mind them being respectful of my workout. “and in 2008 or 2009, i outright won a 10k race. i passed the lead guy with about a mile to go and won by a couple of minutes. when we were done, i went up to congratulate him on a good race. he refused to shake my hand.” paris has a similar story about a trail runner who wouldn’t let her pass him up a hill, despite clearly ruining his own race by speeding up too much. but she points out that generally fell running is democratic: “here, you can have an elite runner and an 80-year-old in the same race, and we all have tea and cake together afterwards. there’s genuinely very little ego in this sport.” where female winners often do encounter sexism, though, is in the reactions to their achievements. thomas remarks that she’s constantly asked if she has kids, “with the assumption that if i did, i wouldn’t be doing what i was doing”."
"paris says that she avoided looking too much at the comments under the articles about her victory. we also talk aboutemelie forsberg, a star of the ultrarunning world, with multiple wins to her name. recently she had a baby with her partner,kilian jornet– himself probably the closest thing ultrarunning has to a household name. forsberg was posting oninstagramabout her return to competition in the courmayeur-champex-chamonix (ccc; part of the utmb race series), which would take her about 12 hours. paris says she immediately spotted one reply asking: “when you run for 12 hours, who looks after your baby? don’t you worry about her?” “she replied with four words: ‘she has a father,’” paris says. “and i thought yes, that absolutely sums it up. it’s crazy.” and so, despite these amazing athletes conquering distances most of us would consider an effort in a car, there’s still a considerable way to go. but make no mistake, times are changing in the endurance game. and these women know better than most how to stay in it for the long haul. if you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for weekend magazine’s letters page, please emailweekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."
"from marathon binges to marathon running, here’s why former substance users find release in hitting the pavement even in his cocaine-bingeing years, which culminated in his car being shot at by drug dealers, charlie engle was the top salesman at the fitness club he worked at. you might call him a high achiever. nowengle is an ultramarathon runnerin some of the world’s most inhospitable environments, and author of the memoir the running man. he tells guardian australia that, for him, part of the attraction is the pursuit of novelty. “in my view, drug taking is very much about chasing firsts,” he says. “the absolute best i ever felt in relation to drugs was actually the acquisition of the drug. there’s nothing more powerful than having the drugs in my pocket; the idea of what it can be. “and, in a way, running is the same because there’s this weird idea that you’re going to enter a 100-miler and this time it’s going to be different. this time it’s not gonna hurt so much, and everything’s going to be perfect.” swapping substances for running – over any other sport – is common. the addiction and recovery websitethe fix regularly publishes running articles, and memoirs about this lifestyle swap include catra corbett’s reborn on the run, caleb daniloff’s running ransom road and catriona menzies-pike’s the long run. in the case menzies-pike, the former “gin-addled bookworm” used to eye runners with suspicion as she nursed her lattes and hangovers. she’d spent a decade adrift after the sudden death of her parents before it struck her that she’d been preoccupied with distance and endurance and running away, so perhaps the logical answer was actual running. now the sydney-based editor has run five marathons.“i was not at a great point in my life,” she tells guardian australia. “i really hadn’t dealt with the death of my mum and dad at all, but when i started running there was this quick conversion, and then a whole lot of other things started to fall more into an orderly shape. i started to sleep better and eat better, and i started getting trashed less. there was structure that came into my life.” it’s an outcome echoed in new film brittany runs a marathon, released in australia on 31 october. its title character – a heavy drinker who is overweight and has low self-esteem – hasn’t processed the death of her father. she goes to the doctor hoping for a quick fix of adderall but is instead prescribed exercise. brittany decides to aim for the new york city marathon and her training helps her get her life on track. menzies-pike says: “running gave me a space to deal with the fact that i fucked up the grieving process. i found tremendous emotional variety in that space, and i would have these periods of total relaxation as i looked at a beautiful sydney waterside view, and then other periods of experiencing physical resistance."
"then there were periods of total emotional turmoil, where all of these suppressed feelings would rise up and i’d be running against them.” when a person gives up one dopaminergic behaviour, such as taking substances, they’re likely to experience cross-addiction and chase the same sense of stimulation in something else. but why long-distance running in particular? both behaviours require a capacity for endurance, provide a sense of release, can instil the intoxicating feeling of being an outlier, and can be solitary pursuits. the sydney-based journalist paul maley is a trail runner who knocked his heavy drinking on its head four years ago to focus on his more active pursuit. he has now ticked off ultramarathons including the blackall 100 and the 250km big red run. “it became increasingly difficult [to run] as my drinking got heavier, to the point where a choice was required,” he says. “and i chose running. you don’t have to be sigmund freud to see the relationship there. in both cases you’re chasing that dopamine or endorphin rush.” running produces boosts in dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the first instance, with the more hard-earned “runner’s high” of endorphins and –some researchers think– an endocannabinoid called anandamide coming later. a person might reasonably expect that, when they give up substances their behaviour becomes less self-centred but, as maley points, out: “you need to find other ways of coping with stress and managing your emotions. after i stopped drinking i was much more self-absorbed and spent much more time in my own head – no one tells you how self-absorbing the process is. running was really good for stilling my mind because it’s quite meditative.” by her own admission, menzies-pike used to view runners with suspicion and, as engle notes, extreme training can elicit more comments of concern from people than getting wasted ever did. “people regularly ask me, ‘do you think that’s healthy?’” he says, laughing. “i’m going to sound very judgmental, but i think people who criticise very likely feel badly about themselves. in my experience, it’s rarely based in true concern. because if they’re around me enough, they’re going to see how running makes me happy.” it can be true that those with an all-or-nothing mindset may wind up overdoing it. that was the case for lisa bench, a newcastle-based administrative assistant. “i literally ran myself into the ground,” she says. “exactly the same as with the booze.” when she stopped drinking, bench was drawn to the sugar she was missing in alcohol. to counteract her unhealthy diet, she decided she needed to exercise excessively. “i started on the treadmill but i didn’t want to be known as that chick at the gym on the treadmill for 90 minutes, monday to sunday,” she says, “because then you’ve got a problem.” so she started pounding the pavement where people might not notice; first 5km, then nine, right up to 24 – all before getting to the office by 8.30am, buzzing. tracking her progress with apps made her more obsessive."
"“i’d think, ‘maybe i could not put makeup on today. maybe i could get away with not washing my hair so that i can get more of the run in. i’ve got an eating disorder as well, because that’s closely linked with alcoholism, and i was running on practically nothing.” she became thin and exhausted with an unshakeable headache, so she finally took heed of her husband’s pleading and took a day off. she went to see an acupuncturist and stopped running altogether. but she feels restless. “i get bored so quickly,” she says. “it’s all about escaping reality for me.” engle says: “i see tons of addiction in the running community that doesn’t necessarily manifest in drugs but in other behaviours. there is something that’s not fulfilled. it’s not a negative, it’s just a space that needs to be filled with something other than normal living – because i personally don’t have any interest in being in that safe middle ground.”"
"welcome to the badwater ultramarathon: a 135-mile non-stop race over three mountain ranges in sweltering mid-summer desert heat with a vertical ascent of 13,000 feet at 9.30pm on 23 july 2018, the second wave of runners lined up at badwater basin in death valley, 280 feet below sea level. the heat from the day had not cooled and the temperature was 118f (48c), even though the sun had long since gone down. to make matters worse, it was abnormally humid for the california desert. sixty-two-year-old pamela chapman-markle looked down the line of racers, recognizing about half the competitors from previous years. on a normal day she would be heading to bed in a half hour, and although her heart was racing with anticipation, she was already tired, acutely aware that she was about to miss two nights of sleep. the starting gun fired and the runners set off on an incline. there would be 14,600ft of cumulative elevation for the runners to climb over the course of the 135-mile race ahead. chapman-markle tried to calm her emotions and steady her heart rate. five miles in, her throat was already sore from the still drier air, a drastic shift from the 90% humidity she trained in. with no light pollution, she could see the stars clearly, but at 62, her vision at night wasn’t as good as it used to be, so she relied on a waist belt to light her path. for the first 20 miles, she passed runners, while others passed by her. soon though, she wouldn’t see anyone for long stretches. chapman-markle would have to run the first 42 miles by herself before her crew could pace her just before daybreak. and even then, her pacers would follow behind her single file and switch off every five miles, returning to the cool air conditioning of the car chapman-markle’s husband drove up ahead. chapman-markle would have to do with ice. ice she put down her sports bra, ice she chewed, ice water she drank as she tried to contend with the overwhelming heat. last year, chapman-markle finished the badwater 135 ultramarathon in 34hr 30min, setting a record in the women’s 60-plus age group for a third year in a row. now 63, chapman-markle is the oldest female competitor in the race with designs on beating her record yet again. she is one of 95 competitors from 21 countries and 30 states accepted to run the ultramarathon this year. the 135-mile race, which takes place this year from 15-17 july starting in death valley and and ending at whitney portal, 8,300ft above sea level, is often referred to as “the world’s toughest footrace”. badwater 135 is considered by many ultrarunners to be the crown jewel of ultramarathons, which are defined as anything longer than a marathon. temperatures climbed as high as 127f (53c) last year, and the asphalt road can get even hotter, causing the road to burn to runners’ feet. chapman-markle had the soles on three pairs of shoes melt last year."
"the race traverses three valleys and three mountain ranges, and after 122 grueling miles, runners face a steep final ascent to whitney portal at an elevation of 8360ft. “risk of very, very serious medical issues in a race like badwater is high,” shawn bearden, a professor of physiology at idaho state university and ultrarunner himself, said. “we’re not built to go 50 miles, 100 miles, or badwater 135 miles. “but we are capable of it.” the biggest challenge running badwater is the heat. bearden, who has crewed and paced for the badwater race once and studied the physiology of ultrarunning, notes that the reason competitors are able to complete it is the human ability to thermoregulate and cool down by sweating. but badwater puts a massive strain on one’s thermoregulation and therefore on one’s gastrointestinal system. “the only way you’re going to survive badwater is by consuming enough fluids and getting fluids and nutrients back in,” bearden explained. “that means we’ve got to be able to sweat a lot and send blood to our skin to cool off, while sending blood to our muscles to keep us moving, while sending blood to our gut to absorb water and nutrients. so there’s a massive strain on all of those tissues and systems.” and if a runner attempted to just drink water and not eat? “you have a good chance of dying by the end from a condition called hyponatremia,” bearden said, “where you effectively dilute the salts in your blood because you’re losing some of your sweat and you’re only replacing water.” that’s not to mention the muscle breakdown, which bearden describes on a molecular level looking “like a blender went through it,” and takes months to repair, even if a runner feels good enough to run a week later. ***** matt collins had just left the 100-kilometer mark at forest park in queens and his pacer, a cross country buddy from college, along with it. his feet padded the ground in the fresh shoes that he had changed into at the stop, where he had taped the blisters on the outside of his big and pinkie toes, and for a moment, his calloused and reddened feet were dry. he attempted to get down some pizza as he walked and readied himself for running another marathon and a half. with each stride, his hamstrings and quads screamed. his legs had been cramping for miles, and he knew the pain wouldn’t go away. it’s not going to get any worse, he told himself. collins had been looking to the 100-kilometer marker since the beginning of the great new york 100-miler, as he cut through central park heading north, ran along the hudson and through the bronx, and crossed the bridge into queens with his pacer, where they laughed at collins’ poor form reflected in store windows – his heel strike too hard, hitting the pavement like a heavy man. they sang country songs as they ran along the water in queens and passed picnics and soccer games."
"when they reached the unisphere fountains at flushing meadows corona park, the two jumped in and let the water fall down on them. now that the 62 miles were behind him, as well as the highs of the last 15, collins was exhausted, daunted by the 38 miles ahead he had to face alone. he picked up his legs. collins also had badwater, a mere three weeks away, on his mind. at 28, he would be the youngest competitor in the race, and the 100-miler he was currently running was in part in preparation for badwater. could he keep his hydration at a high enough level? he would need it for badwater’s heat. aware of his tendency to go out too strong, he had begun today’s race at a moderate pace. at alley pond park in queens, around 51 miles into the race, he took down four dixie cups of pickle juice, savoring the salty brine of electrolytes and greedy for more. collins had been behind on training. “intramural hockey games probably don’t get you ready for the hardest race in the world,” collins said, laughing at his attempts to stay fit as he finished up his mba at wharton business school in philadelphia. at times, he would come home from a night out with classmates and head out on a run at 5am. “maybe because we’re a little younger, we definitely have more of a cowboy attitude,” collins said about running ultramarathons with his pacer for badwater, another college cross country buddy. but badwater is the first race he’s pored over online resources for information on how to run the course, even sparing a few minutes during the great new york 100-miler to talk to the race director, who ran badwater, for tips. since then, he has run two to three 20-mile runs a week in his parents’ basement, with the space heaters cranked up until he blew a fuse and had to rearrange the outlets. on the other days of the week, he runs up to six miles, and will sit in the sauna set at 160f for as long he can handle. “the heat impacts everything else,” he said. “if you’re not keeping cool, keeping smart, then you fall behind on electrolytes, which means your body can’t take in food, which means you can’t really move forward, and you’re cramping.” collins’ training is in sharp contrast with chapman-markle. after her first ultramarathon (or marathon for that matter), a 100-miler through the woods in texas aged 55 that left her hypothermic, dangerously dehydrated, and with a stress fracture in right tibia, her grown children drove her to the hospital, where she had iv fluids hooked up to her arm. “no more, mom,” they told her. “try something else.” chapman-markle instead decided to do more research on how to properly train for an ultramarathon. forty-five ultramarathons later, six this year alone, and after two years focusing on proper form, chapman-markle has a strenuous, consistent training schedule and strict recovery routine."
"she has not only remained healthy, but has been breaking usa track & field records for her age group and is pursuing the world records now. based in galveston, texas, chapman-markle runs in 38c weather with 90% humidity regularly, hitting the roads around 2 or 3pm on the weekdays while the sun is still high in the sky when she gets home from her job as a nurse anesthetist. every other weekend, chapman-markle and her husband, who has crewed her since her second race, head to her condo 30 minutes north of austin in the hills. there he will hop on a bike as she runs the hills for two to four hours. “the closer i get to badwater, the more mileage i’ll add on, so sometimes, i do two-a-day trains, i might go out for two and a half hours in the morning and an hour and a half at night.” to prep for the 13-mile hike at the end of badwater, she’ll put on a 10-pound weighted vest and hike her running route. “i think you can walk it faster than you can run it, because it’s an 8% to 10% grade,” she said of the final push. and on the recovery side of her preparation, chapman-markle is just as thorough: she sits in the sauna built into her house every night for 30 to 40 minutes to help her heat train before heading to bed for seven to eight hours. ***** consistency is key to ultrarunning and completing badwater 135, shawn bearden said. “consistency is several fold,” he notes, pointing to consistency in one’s day-to-day training and being consistent in one’s training over years, and keeping one’s diet – whether high-carb, high-fat, or otherwise – consistent. “it takes years for people to build up really to being able to comfortably handle these very long distances.” this is also one reason runners in badwater are, on average, older. the average age for badwater 135 participants is 47 years old, with the oldest at 72. there are a few other reasons bearden points to: as we age, we develop more of slow-twitch muscles that help on long runs. psychological maturity comes with age. “older people have a better understanding that the sun will come up tomorrow,” bearden said. and it takes years for people to develop what he calls “craft”: the skills of ultrarunning and understanding the limits and needs of one’s body. for 51-year-old filipino tess bibal leono, the biggest challenge to her training is the stray dogs. an analyst for the asian development bank in the philippines, leono’s work brings her to islands throughout the pacific, where many hotels don’t have gyms and she will have to run on the road. packs of stray dogs will begin to follow her and chase her if she continues running. “if i see a dog, i try to stop running. so it kind of limits your training,” she said. leono ran the badwater 135 in 2016 and 2018, quitting in 2018 after 80 miles due to acid reflux."
"too excited for the race, she hadn’t slept the night before, and with record heat and unusual humidity, the event had thelowest completion ratein its 41-year history, with many of those disqualified by the time limit or quitting the race having finished the race in previous years. “i didn’t prepare,” leono said. “i thought i prepared well.” her training for the 2018 badwater had been disrupted at times by her busy travel schedule. this year, she made a commitment to get in at least 30 minutes a day if traveling, and she will often get back to the hotel after work and nap, waking at 9pm or 12am to get a run in the hotel’s gym even if it’s just five kilometers. she has been running marathons on the weekends and tack on an extra 10 kilometers as the rest of the marathoners head home. the final hurdle for competitors is the psychological aspect. “i really think that most people who are capable of running a full marathon really could step up and run 100 miles,” bearden said. “it’s all about your mindset and how you can handle every cell your body screaming and telling you, this is stupid. you should stop.” “that’s part of being an ultrarunner, you always get extremely depressed because you’re sleep-deprived, and fluids and sodium aren’t proper, and your brain will want you to stop, to quit, or [ask] why are you doing this? i know why i’m doing this,” chapman-markle said. “the one thing i do have is mental strength. and i think that’s probably 65% of running a race like this.” chapman-markle tries to stay positive and think nothing but grateful thoughts. “if bad thoughts do come in, i think my body needs something so i just try to figure out what it needs, give it to it, and get back to my happy thoughts,” she said. “it’s obviously very physically hard. mentally it is probably harder,” collins said. he recalled his first ultramarathon, a 50-miler he participated in to raise money for roswell park cancer institute, where his brother was battling leukemia. “for me, i had a reason to be out there so that eliminated a lot of the temptation of dropping out and seeing there’s an escape valve. for me, there was just the finish line,” he said. ***** for collins, the 100-mile great new yorkrunningexposition didn’t prompt the usual roller coaster of emotion he normally experiences during an ultramarathon. collins finished first, crossing the finish line at 16hr 11min, jubilant to sit down and cheer on his friend who had closed in on his lead and finished first for the women. “i felt really excited for what we’re going to do in three weeks [at badwater],” he said. “it was exactly the test i wanted it to be.” collins was clear that the race was an exception. “it was the first one ever i haven’t cried,” he said. he had run the great new york 100-miler before, the terrain was relatively flat, and the weather, at 80f, mild."
"badwater would be another beast. but collins has learned a lot since his first ultramarathon at 24 and about what his body can handle. he tried to drive home by himself from that first 50-miler and, in sheer exhaustion, put the car into an embankment. this time, he booked himself a hotel in times square where the race ended, so he wouldn’t have to walk too far. “you just go to such insane lows, and that bring you to such amazing highs,” collins said. “i’m not usually good at race specific training, which this race is a bit of an aberration from that.” before heading off to the desert this weekend, collins flew to puerto rico for the fourth of july weekend, taking the week before badwater off from any strenuous runs. when asked what he’d do with his week off, he said with a smile: “probably nothing productive.”"
"nick griffiths sent two digits lost to frostbite to yukon hotel renowned for sourtoe special the amputated toes of a british endurance athlete are to be given new life, as the centrepiece of a notorious canadian cocktail. as nick griffiths lay in a hospital bed last year aftersuccumbing to frostbitein the yukon arctic race in northwest canada,the world’s coldest ultra-marathon,his mind drifted to an advertisement he had seen earlier in a hotel in the territory. “it said: ‘had frostbite? we want your toes,’” griffiths told the guardian. “i thought it was a bit of a joke, really.” it was not. for more than 40 years, visitors have flocked to the downtown hotel in dawson city for a chance to try the country’s most infamous drink: the sourtoe cocktail. the beverage consists of a mummified human toe floating in a whiskey shot; patrons must let the digit – or its blackened nail – touch their lips in order to receive a certificate and qualify for admittance to the sourtoe cocktail club. upon returning home to bolton, griffiths learned he would lose three of his toes to the frostbite. he asked the surgeon to keep them. during his recovery, he began corresponding with the downtown hotel about possibly donating the digits, but his physical rehabilitation and work hours complicated plans to travel to yukon. months passed and griffiths kept his toes in jars “just in my bedside drawer”. finally, after much back and forth with the hotel, he suggested simply mailing them tocanada. at the post office, he panicked after being asked what was in the polythene envelope. “i couldn’t think of anything. i didn’t want to just blatantly lie and say it was a candle or whatever.” he told the postal clerk he was mailing his toes – and wrote “novelty gift” on the envelope. he kept one of the toes as “insurance” because, he said: “i’m not sure really you should be posting toes.” more than a month later, the toes arrived in dawson city. “we couldn’t be happier to receive a new toe. they are very hard to come by these days,” said the hotel in a statement. terry lee, the hotel’s “toe expert” will now preserve the digits in rock salt for at least six weeks before they are served in whiskey. “the big toe is the money toe,” lee told the canadian broadcasting corporation. “we usually don’t get frostbitten toes. usually, they’re from gout or diabetes, or they’re lawnmowers or chainsaws or accidents … to get a frostbitten toe, that’s phenomenal.” there are currently three toes in use. in recent years, the hotel has grappled witha spate of toe thefts, and the hotel now nails anyone who attempts to swipe a toe with a fine of c$2,500 (£1,500). the establishment is now trying to convince griffiths to make the trip to the yukon to try the cocktail. he is not sure if anyone has ever sipped the whiskey with their own toe swirling around, but is keen to be the first."
"“people look at you as though you’re a bit mad, he said. “but i think it’s a nice little bit of fun.”"
"he was often on the verge of giving up such gruelling challenges, but eventually adharanand finn found that ultrarunning led him to a meditative state inever wanted to run an ultra marathon. i’ve always loved running, the freedom of it, the childish abandon, but i was a 10k and half-marathon runner, a “real” runner (in my eyes), someone who pushed the pace and gunned for fast times.ultrarunning, with all its backpacks, poles and food, was not really running. it was running with all the joy bludgeoned out of it. so when a magazine editor asked me to run the 165kmoman desert marathonto write an article about it, i said no: 100 miles across sand, in the heat of oman. it sounded like hell. but as the days went by, and i thought about it again, i began to wonder why people did these races. ultra races are anything longer than a marathon, starting at about 30 miles, and going all the way up to the world’s longest race, a 3,100-mile jaunt around a single city block in new york. despite the almost incomprehensible distances, the sport of ultrarunning has been growing at an incredible rate, with around a 1,000% increase in participants globally in the past 10 years. what was going on? why were people doing it? was it simply to impress their friends – a symptom of our show-off, selfie-obsessed modern culture? i found that even just talking about doing one had people shaking their heads in wonder. the pictures of me slogging across the desert would certainly be a hit on instagram. but surely there was more to it than that… the more i thought about it, the more i began to see it not as a running race, but as an adventure. to traverse the desert on foot for five days, carrying everything i needed on my back, running at night under the stars, would surely be an amazing life experience. and who knew what i might discover about myself along the way? so i got back to the editor and said yes. “i know it’s a bit bonkers,” he said. “only do the first day if you want.” but no, i now wanted the full experience. the idea had gripped me and was slowly dragging me in. i wanted to know what it was like to take on such a challenge and make it out the other side. in the end, my experience in the oman desert ebbed and flowed. at times i felt strong, powerful, racing like a supercharged hero across the sand. at other times i was a wreck, whimpering and on the verge of giving up. but somehow i made it to the end, to the finish on the beach, where i ran straight into the sea and, bobbing in the waves, swore i’d never do anything so stupid again. but it wouldn’tleave me alone, this urge to push myself further, to test myself, and to come through to the other side. i started entering more and more ultra marathons."
"i ran 100 miles through the pyrenees, hallucinating about cocktail parties on the side of a mountain midway through a second consecutive night without sleep. i ran for 24 hours around a running track in south london. in the end i ran 10 ultra marathons in two years. the training wasn’t too extreme. occasionally, i would get up at 4am and head to the coast path near my home in devon and run for four hours. but mostly the training wasn’t much more exhausting or time-consuming than before, when i was a “serious” road runner. the races themselves were when the big effort happened. my runs became longer, but slower and, in that sense, more enjoyable. i went off-road and took in the scenery. i brought snacks and sat down to eat them. the speed was no longer important. at first, what motivated me, and kept me moving in races, was the outcome. i wanted to reach the finish line and to bask in all the relief and the warm satisfaction that came with conquering these races. the process, however, kept breaking me. in every single race, i reached a moment of crisis, where i sat down on the side of the trail and wanted to give up, where i asked myself why i was in this stupid race. the answer was always elusive and i came close to quitting many times. i noticed that the people who did well in these races were often those with a calm, steely focus; people who seemed to be able to maintain an even emotional state throughout. i, on the other hand, more emotional than i had realised, was as up and down and as out of control as a child on a bouncy castle. i would get surges of energy where i felt i could win the entire race, skipping down mountain sides like a character in a cgi movie. and then, bam, i’d crash and tumble into dejection, anger, frustration. i would get mad at the race organisers for sending me up such steep hills. i would get mad at the hills themselves. seasoned ultrarunners call these moments of crisis – when you’re struggling to find the will to go on – the pain cave. and they talk about how they relish going there, how they love digging in the pain cave. but whenever i got even a few steps inside, all i could think was: “they’re all mad.” the pain cave was horrible, it ate you up, it tore you apart. why would anyone want to experience this level of tiredness, this aching of every limb, seasoned with the thought you still had 50 miles to go? actually, it was often this thought that was the worst thing. the moment you looked at your watch and started to calculate how far you still had to go, the distance was usually so overwhelming that just the thought of it hit you like a punch to the stomach."
"ultrarunners repeatedly told me that the key was to stay in the moment, to run the mile you’re in and forget about the rest. that sounded easy, but it wasn’t. i read about a us runner who had lost some short-term memory function in an operation to cure her of epilepsy. as a result, when she ran, she never knew how far through a race she was, or how far she had to go. so she had no choice but to exist in the moment and just keep moving. it caused her no end of difficulties in her day-to-day life, but it made her a formidable ultrarunner. but how could i emulate her powers in my own ultrarunning? one trick was to ditch my watch, which helped a little. but i still longed for the outcome. one runner told me his big problem was that he always thought about the finish too early. at first, i didn’t see why that was a problem. surely that sweet feeling of conquering the race, of making it to the end, was a positive driving force. but the thought could break you, because the end was usually so far away, and because just thinking about it took you out of the present moment. as the japanese marathon monks ofmount hieionce told me about their challenge to complete 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days, it was a meditation in movement. ultrarunning, done well, was all about the process, not the outcome. and, like a meditation, that meant staying in the moment. eventually, i realised the secret was to embrace the struggle, as they’d told me all along. to stand in the midst of the storm, facing the oblivion, and to say to yourself: this is why i’m here. this is what i came for. a friend who ran two of my 100-mile races with me said an ultra marathon doesn’t begin until 50 miles in. “at the start,” she said, “i have too much energy, but when i get tired, everything melts away and it’s just me and the running.” yes, in the oblivion, deep in the pain cave, if we dig deep enough, if we push on through, we come to a place where it is strangely peaceful, where everything else melts away, even, amazingly, the pain in our legs, the tiredness that had seemed so debilitating, it all clears. and there, out in the mountains, or even on a city running track, we find ourselves fully present in the moment. it’s rare, in our modern lives, to come this close to our stripped-back, primal selves. in the end, i found that in depths of an ultra marathon lies a stillness, an awareness of existence, that makes it all worthwhile. it was strange, but despite initially longing for that feeling of arriving at the finish as the all-conquering hero, glowing with the satisfaction of achieving my goal, in reality the end, when it came, was often an anti-climax."

"nicky spinks, 51, pulled out of 100-mile barkley race in us, which no one finished this year a british runner was one of the last women to drop out in this year’s barkley marathons, a gruelling race that has been completed by just 15 people in its history and has ascents equivalent to climbing everest twice. nicky spinks, 51, a beef farmer and breast cancer survivor from west yorkshire, ran alongside a canadian, stephanie case, in an attempt at the 100-mile mountain event widely regarded as the world’s toughest ultra-marathon. for a second successive year, none of the 40 selected starters finished. spinks and case completed the first 20-mile lap together and dropped out partway through lap two in appalling weather conditions. five male runners completed three laps. staged in frozen head state park, tennessee, the race comprises five laps, each with about 10,000 feet of steep, muddy ascent through thick woodland. there is a 60-hour time limit. runners navigate their way around an unmarked course, tearing pages from hidden books as they go and returning them to the event’s enigmatic organiser, gary “lazarus lake” cantrell. the race was first held in 1986 and was made famous by a 2014 netflix documentary. spinks, from huddersfield, is no stranger to difficult races. last year she became thefirst person to complete a double ramsay roundin the highlands, running 116 miles with 57,000ft of ascent and twice summiting 24 mountains (23 of them munros) in 55 hours and 56 minutes. she also won the women’s race in september’s ultra tour monte rosa in switzerland. recovering in the us, spinks said: “the barkley marathons was extremely tough in many ways. the first lap was run in really hot conditions, too hot for my liking, and then the second lap was the opposite, unbelievably cold with lots of rain. “i ran with stephanie, who is a barkley veteran, and she was brilliant in helping me learn about the unique elements of the race. lap one took us about 11 and a half hours, which was longer than i had hoped, but the temperatures, the difficult terrain and the time spent trying to find the well-hidden books all played a part.” after a quick turnaround with their support crews, spinks and case set off on the second lap in the dark with fellow runners michiel panhuysen and billy reed, but the weather forced them back to camp in the early hours. “the weather forecast didn’t really detail just how cold it was going to be in the mountains and none of us had extreme winter kit in our race packs. it turned out to be incredibly cold and wet, which, together with the darkness and fog, made for slow going,” spinks said. “when we realised we had no chance of completing lap two inside the time limit, we took an escape route. i’m not one to give up on anything, but i’m glad we made the decision we did. it was the right decision."
"even coming back down the valley, away from the higher ground, we were still struggling with the cold. i don’t think i’ve ever felt that cold.” the race was inspired by a nearby prison break by james earl ray, martin luther king’s assassin, in 1977, and it is shrouded in secrecy, with the route changed each year. spinks said: “we returned to camp in the early hours, though i’m not sure when exactly as the watches laz [cantrell] made us all wear didn’t tell the proper time. “i think that to complete the full five laps is, well … i can see now why only 15 people have done that in 33 years. laz makes the race harder and harder, changes the course so even the barkley veterans don’t know where the books are, and this year i think he added in even more uphill climbs. that’s all part of what makes barkley marathons the race it is.”"
"jasmin paris,the ultrarunner who became a global sensationearlier this month when she won the 268-mile spine race, beating her male rivals by 15 hours and the course record by over 12, has been rewarded by selection to run for britain for the first time at the age of 35. paris, who also holds three separate uk 24-hour mountain running records while holding down a job as a full-time vet, is named in a british team of 12 for june’s trail world championships in miranda do corvo in portugal. this follows her victory in one of the world’s toughest races, along the pennine way from edale in the peak district to kirk yetholm in the scottish borders in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. britain’s squad also includes the world long-distance mountain running champion, charlotte morgan, as well as the men’s ultra skyrunning world champion, jon albon. the 2013 world ultra-trial champion, ricky lightfoot, and andrew davies, who ran for england in last year’s commonwealth games, also get the nod. the british team leader, adrian stott, hailed his strong squad and predicted that it would challenge for the podium: “the strength in depth of mountain and trail running in the uk just now is apparent in the strong men’s and women’s teams selected. the british team has traditionally competed well and come home with team medals from these championships. we are sure our team will again be a match to challenge the leading nations like spain, italy, france and the usa. “the fact it is a relatively short but technical 45km course for this year’s ultra-trail championship has been reflected in the selection with a mix of experienced ultra-runners and long-distance fell runners, well suited to doing well in june.” senior women:katie kaars sijpesteijn, jo meek, charlotte morgan holly page, jasmin paris, georgia tindley.senior men:jon albon, seb batchelor, carl bell, andrew davies, ricky lightfoot, andy symonds."
"the winner of the brutal montane spine race on how hiking with her baby helped her to smash the men’s record – despite having to express milk along the way it is britain’s most brutal running race – 268 miles non-stop along the pennine way, from edale in derbyshire to the scottish borders, in january.jasmin paris, who is still breastfeeding her 14-month-old daughter rowan, and was expressing milk along the way, this week beat 136 other competitors – including 125 men – from 15 different countries, to win themontane spine raceoutright. in the process, on wednesday, she smashed the men’s course record by more than 12 hours. paris, who is a vet working at the university of edinburgh and studying acute myeloid leukaemia, told the guardian she had planned to wean her daughter before the race began, but two back-to-back viral infections meant baby rowan refused to take anything except milk for five days, and so by the time of the race she was still breastfeeding to avoid mastitis. “i had to express during the race so it didn’t get uncomfortable,” she says. “at the first checkpoint, it slowed me down a lot and i had to hurry afterwards to catch back up.” as the race progressed she produced less milk, so the expressing became quicker. “in the end,” she says, “it was less of a problem than i’d feared.” to fit her training for the spine race in around her job and family life, paris had to get up at 4am each day, when she would head out for runs in the hills around her home near edinburgh, while her family were still in bed. she also went on plenty of long hikes with her baby. “my coach told me to get a weight vest to practice running with a backpack,” she says. “but i thought, i have a baby, i’ll take her. it was decent training.” in all, she was out on the course for 83 hours and 12 minutes, pausing to power nap, eat and express milk for a total of only seven hours along the way. she had to carry everything she needed, and had to navigate using a map and compass, mostly alone and in the dark. but she was relentless. previous winnereugeni roselló soléfrom spain pushed himself so hard chasing her in second place that he was forced to pull out of the race exhausted with four miles to go. almost 20 hours after she had finished, only two men had completed the race, with everyone else either still out on the course or retired. paris says the hardest part was the first 24 hours. “it’s weird, but i missed my family most then, and i still had so far to go.” she says by the end she was completely absorbed in the race, trying to stay ahead of her rivals, and the thought of seeing her daughter again was spurring her on. she has alsospoken of hallucinationsbecause of lack of sleep."
"“on the final section, i kept seeing animals appearing out of every rock,” she says. “and i kept forgetting what i was doing out there.” top british ultra runner and formerspine race finisher damian hallsays: “her performance was extraordinary – one of the great british ultra-running performances. “what’s especially impressive is that it’s her first time doing a race like this – and she was racing against some previous winners. she showed incredible determination and focus. it’s unusual for someone to do so well when they’re new to this type of racing, which is seriously tiring.” olympian jo paveysays paris’s performance was “awesome and inspiring … it must have been amazing for her to cross the finish line and have her little one there for a hug.” what was that like? paris laughs. “my daughter’s really sociable,” she says. “so she had made friends with all the officials and people at the finish. when she saw me, she wasn’t really that bothered.” since finishing, paris has been caught up in a whirlwind of attention, with television appearances andchelsea clinton tweeting about her victory. “in a way, this bit has been harder than the race,” she says. “at least then i just had one job to do: keep putting one foot in front of the other.” all she craves now is a good night’s sleep. “and then i have a thesis to write,” she says."
"shattered record while beating all male and female rivalsrunner expressed breast milk for her baby at aid stations the british ultrarunner jasmin paris is celebrating after becoming the first woman to win the gruelling 268-mile montane spine race along the pennine way. what made the performance even more extraordinary was that she shattered the course record by 12 hours – while also expressing breast milk for her baby at aid stations along the route. paris, a 35-year-old vet who works at the university of edinburgh studying acute myeloid leukaemia, is well known in british endurance running circles having won the british women’s fell running championships last year as well as a series of leading ultraraces. however, her performance at the montane spine race was undoubtedly the best in her career as she beat all her male and female rivals in completing the course from the edale in the peak district to the kirk yetholm in the scottish borders in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. that time shattered the previous best of 95hrs 17mins set by eoin keith in 2016 as paris became the first woman to win the race outright. the previous female race record was 109hr 54min set by carol morgan in 2017. after the race, in which runners carry their own kit throughout and rest only when essential, paris admitted to having hallucinations in the later stages. “it is really tough,” said paris after running along the full pennine way through the peak district, yorkshire dales, north pennines and over hadrian’s wall in northumberland to the cheviots. “two thirds of the time it is dark and it is completely different from any race i’ve run before because it is non-stop. you have the whole challenge of when to sleep and that becomes very tactical, and then you’re sleep-deprived. “when i was on the final section i kept seeing animals appearing out of every rock and kept forgetting what i was doing – hallucinations. every so often i’d come to with a start. on top of that it’s very cold and i was wearing all of my clothes by the time i finished.” paris’s performance was hailed by jo pavey and the british 2016 and 2017 marathon champion aly dixon,who tweeted: “i don’t understand why anyone would want to race 268 miles across the pennine way, in the winter. but i do know how enormous a woman winning the spine race overall and smashing the outright record is. it’s huge!! !”"
"whether it be a training plan from an app such astrainasoneorzombies, run!, or comparing results with fellow runners via a platform such asrunkeeperorstrava, technology has helped lots of runners off the start line, coached their performance and led them to become obsessed with their digital trails. most start off tracking their runs with their smartphone strapped to their arm, but other devices can capture metrics beyond just pace and distance. this is a hefty watch, with a matching price tag. within its titanium casing is a multitude of sensors that can track your activities (running, rowing, cycling, skiing, kayaking and pretty much anything else), your heart rate, heart rate variability (the time between the beats, an indicator of how stressed you are) and pulse ox acclimatisation (the amount of oxygen in your blood – useful if you are training at high altitudes). it can also prompt you along routes it has created, although in built-up areas these weren’t very runner-friendly. apart from this gripe, it’s almost faultless and a powerful device. it’s straightforward to customise for the activities and data you’re most interested in, the screen is easy to read while running, the buttons make it simple to operate and the battery lasts for an age (garmin claims 33 hours of gps tracking or 20 days on standby). however, if you want something for urban running and some racing, something cheaper, such as a garmin forerunner 30 (£130) or a polar m430 (£175), which have hr monitors and gps, would be more than sufficient. best for:ultra-active, high-net-worth individuals who like to run trails, swim wild, ski cross-country and paddleboard – before breakfast. the newest apple watch is a powerful tool for keeping track of your health and exercise. it can measure hr, hrv and vo2 max; other useful features for runners include the ability to make contactless payments and listen to music without lugging your smartphone along too. the watch is, well, watch-size compared to other sports watches, plus it’s aesthetically pleasing enough to wear all day. tracking a run with apple’s activity app works smoothly. other apps and devices can write data to activity, but this is haphazard, resulting in double entries or oddities, such as mistaking cycling up a hill as climbing up stairs. if you’re happy not to stray from the apple apps, this is less of an issue but if you want to share your activities to another platform you would be advised to install thehealthfitapp, which can export your runs to strava, trainingpeaks and other platforms. for £2.99, this app removes one of the apple watch’s two drawbacks. the other issue is poor battery life, not surprising given its small size and the powerful chips and sensors. you’ll need to charge it most days, so using it to track sleep patterns is tricky and there’s not enough juice for tracking long bike rides with gps."
"a new feature of the series 4 is a wrist-based electrocardiogram (ecg) sensor; however, this isn’t enabled on uk devices until apple gains the appropriate eu approval, since it is classified as a medical device. best for:style-conscious runners this strap for apple watches already has eu approval to take ecg measurements, so it could be ideal if you are impatient for this function on the series 4 or you own an older apple watch. the hr sensors in the apple watch and other devices work by using optical sensors in their rear to monitor blood flow in the wrist but the kardiaband can pick up electrical activity from the heart. but why is this of particular interest to runners? an ecg can detect atrial fibrillation (typical afib symptoms would be a fluttering or pounding feeling in the chest), whichis more common in middle-aged endurance athletesthan the general, sedentary population. to monitor your heart, you simply place your thumb on the metal tab on the strap for 30 seconds and the app will tell you if your heart is displaying any signs of afib. the smartrhythm feature will monitor your heart during runs and will prompt you to take an ecg if it notices anything untoward. if you have any concerns, you can show the results to your gp. best for:runners with concerns about their heart as the name hints, these shoes claim to give a 4% boost to your performance, due to the carbon-fibre plate in the sole.eliud kipchogeandabraham kiptumset world records this year wearing them in the marathon and half-marathon respectively. i ran 5k and 10k personal bests in these very light shoes, an improvement of 2.4% and 3.95% respectively. is there any evidence to back up nike’s claims? the 4% claim originated from a nike-funded study but recently two independent studies have been published by us academics. the first found that the shoes do“enhance running economy”by 2.6% to 4.2% (depending on the comparison shoe). the second study concluded that the boost was due to the carbon plate acting as a lever for the foot and that the foam in the shoe’s sole possessed“superior energy storage”. aside from the price, the only drawback seems to be longevity – their bounce is widely reported to fade by 100 miles. so they are definitely a shoe to save for (personal) best. best for:special running occasions this is asmall podto attach to laces, which tracks how much power is generated as you run. you may be tracking distance, heart rate and pace, so why would you want to know your wattage? after monitoring your running habits for a while, the stryd app can calculate the power you should run at for a particular distance, lessening the chances of you “blowing up” before the finish line. and if you are doing interval training, running in zones defined by power is more exact than using your heart rate, which will lag as you recover from exertions."
"in practice, the stryd app was a bit hit and miss, sometimes underestimating distance by half, which messed up the power data. after reinstalling and resetting (and reverting to using a watch to track speed) it became more reliable. best for:competitive, data-hungry runners looking to maximise the benefit from their training sessions running tights and top bysoar running"
"sophie power was stunned to be a social media hit but is pleased maternal guilt is being discussed it was the image that triggered a global debate about motherhood. a little under halfway through one of the world’s most gruelling races,the 105-mile ultra-trail du mont blanc(utmb), sophie power, 36, was photographed at an aid station near the italian ski resort of courmayeur breastfeeding her three-month-old son, cormac. within days, the image had gone viral and was picked up by newspapers from india to indianapolis. now back at home in islington, north london, giving her first interview to a newspaper, power, who until last week did not even have an instagram account, said she had been ill-prepared for the attention she was to receive on social media, but was pleased about the conversation she had started. “it has highlighted something that women feel really unable to talk about. there is this huge mother’s guilt that all the time you need to be 100% focused on your baby, and i’m saying that by not focusing on your own physical and mental health you can’t be the best mother. for me, personally, i need to be physically fit and have those mental breaks.womenreally struggle to be open about saying that.” she said she had thought little of the photograph when it was taken. “in the picture, i’m just focused on feeding cormac, pumping the milk. probably a metre out of shot is my husband, john, trying to convince me to eat an avocado sandwich and going through my pack, changing over my head torch batteries, putting the food in there. alexis [berg, a photographer with the online running community strava] asked if he could take the photo and we thought nothing of it. we thought it might make a small strava story about women doing something a bit different during the race.” considering she has run almost 50 miles, power, co-founder of a company that tackles inner-city air pollution, seems relatively composed in the picture – especially compared with the exhausted male runner lying flat out on his back next to her. “i’d gone through the first night with no sleep, as a lot of runners had. but as a mother i was really prepared for that. in terms of sleep deprivation, i was probably the best trained person on the start line. i’d had 20 minutes’ sleep over two nights. but i was taking the race really gently. some people racing utmb were pushing themselves to the limit. i had to do the opposite. i was trying to keep a lot of food down for my milk supply. i was almost refreshed when i got there compared to a normal race.” before the utmb, which she finished in just under 44 hours, power had run several of the world’s most famous ultra racesincluding the marathon des sablesacross the sahara and the 153-mile,non-stop spartathlon in greece. “i started running in 2009 pretty much from scratch."
"i’d never run more than a mile in my life when i signed up for the marathon des sables not really knowing what it was. i signed up to an ironman barely able to swim a length of a pool.” to enter the utmb, she needed to earn points by running other ultras. power had a place in the 2015 utmb but had to give it up because she was six months’ pregnant with her first son, donnacha, now three. in contrast with injured athletes, the utmb does not allow women to defer their places if they become pregnant. in 2018, having bagged another place, power faced a dilemma: run or spend years amassing more points. “this would mean missing out. i never set out saying i had to finish the course. i just wanted to be in nature, to see how it goes.” it was the thought of running the final metres through chamonix with donnacha that had kept her going through the race’s toughest stages. “i had to tell him to slow down, he was too fast, my legs were too tired. i picked up cormac about 50 metres from the finish and crossed the line with both of them.” while the photograph has been well received on social media, there has been a backlash. a twitter poll by a runner’s magazine asking if readers thought power’s actions were “gross, a little selfish” or “it’s her business” was taken down after readers complained. overall, though, power feels her 15 minutes of fame have sent out a strong and unambiguous message. “this picture has allowed women to say: ‘when we become mothers our self-identity doesn’t change.’ we shouldn’t have to lose who we were before we were mothers. men certainly don’t. you see all these great pictures of dads crossing finishing lines with their babies. why do we as a society see that as different for the mother?”"
"ultramarathons have never had big financial rewards. a trophy, a t-shirt and maybe some free trainers is considered a good haul – but is that about to change? would you be more likely to set a personal best in your next race if someone offered you £100? how about £1,000? or even £5,000? the people behind theultra gobi, a 400km single-stage desert race in china, are hoping to find out whether money can make a difference by announcing a $10,000 prize for anyone who breaks the 71-hour course record. “in 2017, dan lawson laid down an incredible gauntlet in the gobi” says pavel toropov, the race director. “this unparalleled prize is a tribute to that performance and an incentive for the best endurance athletes in the world to challenge it.” prize money in distance running is nothing new. elite marathon runners receive significant appearance fees just to turn up and get six-figure sums for winning big races and setting records. last year, eliud kipchoge was reportedly paid $1m to take part in nike’s breaking2 project and would have received a bonus had he broken two hours. but barring a fewisolated examples, ultramarathons have traditionally been lacking in major financial rewards. a trophy, a t-shirt and maybe some free trainers is considered a good haul. i once won some money for finishing on the podium in a trail run in hong kong – it worked out as just under £3 for each hour raced. but, given the rising global popularity of the sport, this is may change, with other races and sponsors choosing to follow ultra gobi’s example. there are two clear ways in which increased prize money is likely to improve results: the depth of the field and the intensity of preparation. undoubtedly, prize money draws more competitors. although ultra-running has become more popular, only a tiny proportion of the population ever test themselves over such long distances. if a greater pool of talented athletes were running ultramarathons then winning times should be faster. the east african rift valley, home to many of the world’s greatest distance runners, offers a powerful illustration. winning marathons has become the best route out of rural poverty. competitive running is a central part of life in many communities, with almost every ambitious youngster trying their hand. but the absence of prize money has been cited a reason forthe lack of kenyan athletes in ultra-running. were this to change, it’s easy to see how standards could be raised. super-ultra-distance races such as the ultra gobi suffer from specific challenges in attracting the best athletes. i can personally attest to the fact that running across the desert for three or four days with little or no sleep takes an enormous toll on runners’ bodies and can require significant recovery time. the money is thus a way to compensate athletes who might otherwise have chosen to compete in several shorter races. the second area in which prize money can be transformative is training."
"sponsorship opportunities, primarily from shoe companies such as altra, hoka and salamon have enabled a few elite ultra-runners to turn professional. however, many of the best endurance runners still combine training and racing with part-time jobs. dan lawson juggles running for great britain’s 24-hour team with cycle deliveries andrunning a service for recycling running kit. prize money in ultra-running would enable more full-time professionals. their preparation would also be enhanced by better access to facilities, be that high-altitude training, teams of support professional or simply more comfortable prerace transport and accommodation. (i have known some of the best runners sleep in airport lounges before competing in high profile events.) there is of course the risk that the incentive of prize money leads to less welcome training innovations. ultra-running is in many ways ideally suited to illegal doping. although there have been a few isolated cases, it is generally considered to be a clean sport, unlike marathon running or cycling. big money could provide the motivation and the means for this to change. but what about the impact of money on a runner during a race? all endurance sports involve a tussle between mind and body. in his excellent new book,endure, alex hutchinson carefully analyses the physical limits and, more importantly, the mental limits our brains impose to keep us safe. hence the burst of energy upon seeing the finish line that, a few minutes previously, would have seemed impossible. the late stages of an ultramarathon are often as much about determination and desire as anything else. in a life-or-death situation most of us could push a little harder. and money can be a good motivator. a1986 studyfound that people could sustain a wall-sit for longer if they were paid. as hutchinson says: “it’s sort of like being chased by a lion without the danger of getting eaten.” endurance athletes may just be different. underfed students with no other reason may sustain meaningless pain for a few minutes longer in return for some cash. competitive ultramarathon runners have already chosen an extremely painful hobby and are likely to be driven by intrinsic motivation. in hutchinson’s words, for “well-trained athletes, motivation may well be pretty close to maximal already”. based on my own experience at the end of the ultra gobi, nothing short of an actual lion could have made me go any faster. there are some who are resistant to the introduction of big money into ultramarathon running. fears around camaraderie, honesty and sportsmanship are valid, but i believe it can be transformative for the sport. those nostalgic for the days of amateur athletics often overlook the fact that it was largely the preserve of the wealthy. only people with private means can afford to dedicate themselves fully to an unpaid hobby. consequently, many talented athletes lost the opportunity to realise their potential, and fans were prevented from seeing the best performances, as the sad case ofjohn tarrant (aka the ghost runner)so starkly shows."
"bigger prize money in ultramarathons can enable a wider pool of athletes to dedicate more time and be better prepared. this will improve competition and standards. as a follower of the sport, the prospect of watching incredible runners break records and push boundaries is exciting, providing it is accompanied by appropriate safeguards to keep the sport clean and fair. whether or not this money will drive individual runners to dig deeper is a more debatable point. having seen the grit and determination shown by elite ultra-runners i am sceptical. even the facial expressions of a runner such aszach millershow that he is operating close to his mental limits. it will take a very well-funded randomised control trial to find out for sure. i also suspect that some records, like yiannis kouris’s 303.5km 24-hour run, could withstand almost any amount of funding. as for the ultra gobi, the $10,000 purse will add to what promises to be a thrilling 2018 race. with lawson returning to the desert to defend his title and several other big names on show the competition will be fierce. toropov is tipping a female outright winner: “nikki [kimball] is one of the few athletes at home with these kinds of distances. if she can recover from surgery she will have a good chance.” one thing is for certain, whether motivated by pride or profit, it will take a phenomenal performance to better lawson’s record."
"‘i needed to suffer,’ says kílian jornet after breaking record that had stood for 36 years early on sunday morning, as thelake districtbegan to buzz with hikers walking in the glorious sunshine, kílian jornet took the first step towards another remarkable record. the catalan, who last year climbed everest twice in a week, and can run up and down mount blanc in under five hours, is one of the best known athletes in the fast-growing world of adventure sports. he had his sights on tackling the bob graham round, a challenge that involves running a 66-mile circuit of the lake district, climbing and descending 42 of its highest peaks, in 24 hours. only 100 hardy souls attempt it each year, and barely a third finish. jornet, though, flew around and smashed the fastest known time for the route, which has stood for 36 years, by more than an hour. he reached the finish at moot hall in keswick in an astonishing 12 hours and 52 minutes. “i knew i needed to suffer,” jornet told the guardian. “but it was a beautiful suffering.” the 30-year-old, who is 5ft 6in tall and weighs barely nine stone, started racing up and down the mountains in catalonia as a three-year-old, and has been an ultrarunning star for a decade. but he conceded that the bob graham challenge was among the toughest of his career. “in terms of running it’s very hard, because it’s long – 100km or more – and the elevation is huge. the downhills are very steep too so the legs get very tired and it’s always technical as well.” it did not help either that the temperatures in the lake district were pushing high into the 20 degrees centigrade. he laughed when asked whether there was one particularly hard moment. “it was more the last four hours” he said. “it was very hot and i kind of hit the wall on grey knotts. i knew i just needed to suffer and just keep going. one more step. one more step. that’s where it got hard.” jornet fuelled himself with energy gels, fruit, crisps and water. “there were some rivers in the mountains where i could refill a bottle,” he said, “and people gave me water”, but the biggest help he received was from other runners. there are no official route markings or aid stations on the fells; instead, runners rely on the community to help them navigate and finish. one of the rules of the bob graham round club is that you must be accompanied to the top of each fell – and to run a fast time, you also need people who know the route inside out. luckily, jornet was embraced by the community, and accompanied by some of the fastest and most knowledgeable runners in the lake district. “that’s something that’s a big part of the round,” he emphasised. “it’s thanks to all these people that i was able to finish it."
"it was really nice that the person that organised all the logistics was martin stone [who was part of the road crew when the previous record holder billy bland did it in 1982]. “what made it even more special was that one of my pacers was the son of one of billy’s pacers – and billy was there, too. for me, it was so cool to be there with them: they know every stone of the road, of the mountain, and i learnt a lot during the run.” another tradition is that those who have joined the exclusive club of finishers – there are 2,000 members from the event’s 86-year history – then come back to help other runners having a crack at it. jornet, though, who has big name sponsors, has a host of races in his schedule. will he do the same? “yes! for sure!” he said. “i have some friends who want to do it and i think some of the guys who were pacing me, they have in their legs a very fast time. so i hope that they try soon – and that they can go faster than me.”"
"nicky spinks, a 51-year-old farmer, becomes first person to run ramsay round twice amid the razzmatazz of the world cup, wimbledon and the tour de france, one athlete has discreetly set a world record and raised the bar in uk long-distance mountain running. nicky spinks, a cattle farmer from huddersfield in west yorkshire, achieved the first double of the ramsay round, a brutal and technical circuit of the hills and mountains above fort william. it was the first double achieved on the route and marks another milestone in spinks’s impressive career, placing her among the greats of british fell running such as billy bland, joss naylor and kenny stuart. a single round was first set by the lochaber athletic club member charlie ramsay, from edinburgh, in 1978. spinks completed that and then turned around to retrace her steps, doing the “double ramsay” and covering 116 miles (187km). speaking to the guardian as she reversed a cattle trailer at a market in holmfirth, spinks said it was one of the hardest challenges she had completed. “it was incredibly tough. the terrain was really rough and there were hardly any paths and i really couldn’t run that fast because of the heat. i’m not very fast anyway but at times i was going very slowly,” she said. spinks, 51, completed the run in 55 hours and 56 minutes on monday 2 july, having set out at midnight on friday. after a good start and plenty of rice pudding and fruit salad, spinks said she became “slightly worried” when her knees began to ache. she had hoped to complete the run in 48 hours and despite making up time on different sections was unable to achieve the target. “after starting out in the pitch black i realised that i wasn’t going to easily make time on the schedule. this was slightly worrying especially as both muscles above my knees were aching in a funny sort of way,” she said. “i hoped i wasn’t still tired from thegreat lakes racetwo weeks before. i tried massaging them as i climbed but that made no difference. it wasn’t a pleasant temperature as it was sort of warm and cold at the same time. i was hot but my legs felt cold and clammy.” six hours later, having dealt with cramp, dehydration, midges and the heat, spinks said she was back on track and the rest of the run went well. “despite everything, i still found it very enjoyable. it was an excuse to be amongst those scottish hills and mountains that i have always loved.” ramsay, naylor and spinks’s dog, wisp, were at the finish to congratulate her. wisp ran with her for two legs of the course, including one nine-hour stint, along with 18 supporters who carried her rations and clothes. during the run spinks took seven breaks of no more than a few minutes. she celebrated with a double full english breakfast. earlier this year, spinks was awarded the british empire medal for her services to sport and charity."
"spinks began running competitively in 2001 in a four-mile fell race. she had a hysterectomy in 2012 and has also had breast cancer. in 2011, she set a new women’s record of 64 lakeland peaks climbed in 24 hours. two years ago, she completed a 132-mile fell run across the lake district’s highest peaks in less than 48 hours."
"on a hot, sunny sunday evening, the ultra running star shattered the lake district record that had stood for 36 years the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. he is the biggest star in ultra running; the winner of some of the biggest races in the world. last yearhe climbed mount everest twice in one week, without oxygen. and on sunday night, kílian jornet was to be found making history yet again on the fells of the lake district. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. the bob graham round is one of the most celebrated challenges in endurance sport, comprising a course of about 106km with an 8,200m ascent over 42 fells, which must be done within 24 hours. it was devised by a keswick guest-house owner in 1932 and only about 2,000 people have completed the route within the time frame; becoming members of a very exclusive club. yet, on a hot sunny evening, jornet completed the route in 12 hours 52 minutes, shattering – by just over an hour – a record that had stood for 36 years. billy bland, who set that record back in 1982, and is now in his 70s,was himself out on the route to offer support– and in another echo from the past, one of jornet’s pacers was the son of a runner who paced bland. jornet made a point of thanking bland inan instagram postafter the run. jornet is one of the breakout stars of the ultra running world, with an autobiography –run or die– that was shortlisted for the william hill sports books of the year award, andhalf a million followers on instagram. yet very little fuss was made of the attempt, with indications only beginning to circulate on social media over the weekend that the run was under way. attempts at the bob graham must adhere to very specific rules, including informing the club members that you intend to run the course and being accompanied by someone on each of the 42 fells so that they can verify the achievement (no gps trace will do the trick here). this display of camaraderie and support is very much part of the round – it is an individual challenge that nevertheless relies on help from others, particularly when – like jornet – you are not local and don’t know the terrain intimately. the course is divided into five “legs” and club members who have run the route before accompany the challenger on each leg. the third leg is considered the most difficult, with rocky ground and very steep ups and downs. compared with some of the mountain terrain that jornet lives and trains on, the elevation is not extreme – after all, jornet holds the fastest known time for the ascent and descent of matterhorn, mont blanc, denali andeverest– but the ground can be very challenging, with loose rock and trails that would be easy to stray from."
"jornet is only just returning from breaking his fibula in march, though is doing so in style, having won the marathon du mont blanc just a week ago. but if the amount of time he took off the bob graham round record is impressive, it is also worth noting that jasmin paris broke thewomen’s record in 2016 by two-and-a-half hours– and that the record for completing the round twice, back-to-back, is held by another woman,nicky spinks. then again, there are only a tiny handful of people hardy – some might say foolhardy – enough to take on these challenges."
"having only previously run low-key races, how would adharanand finn rise to the challenge of 120km in the italian dolomites? i’ve been running ultra marathons for about 16 months now, but i’ve been mostly keeping tolow-key, smaller racessuch as thering o firein anglesey, or themiwok 100kin california. these races are intimate: you get to know the other runners, the race organisers. you get to feel like an oddball as you shuffle alone at dawn through quiet country towns with your backpack and head torch. but with theutmblooming – the biggest ultra mountain trail race in the world – last week, it was time to get my first taste of the razzmatazz of the european ultra trail circuit, by taking part in thelavaredo ultra trailin the italian dolomites. the world of ultra running may still be little known in the uk or the us, but in france, spain and italy, these races are huge. in the piazza of cortina d’ampezzo, just before the 11pm start, the town is alive with noise and bustle. as well as the 1,600 runners cramming into the start area, thousands of people have come out to cheer us on our way, sitting high up on walls, dancing on hotel balconies, as a huge sound system gees everyone up. the race is 120km along some spectacular and steep mountain trails. it’s a daunting prospect, so i hang near the back as the moment to start approaches. up at the front, superstars of the sport such as the americans hayden hawks and tim tollefson, fernanda maciel from brazil, and the former nepalese child soldier mira rai, are introduced to the crowd to huge cheers. you rarely see this much excitement or buzz at the start of a road race. this is a sport full of colour and adrenalin, with lean, chiselled mountain men and women with tattoos and expansive handshakes everywhere. and a lot of beards. and then, as the clock strikes 11, and to the strains of the race’s theme tune, the ecstasy of gold by ennio morricone,we’re off. the showboating is over – now it’s time to run. with so many competitors, once we leave the town and head into the mountains, the narrow trails get congested to the point where i’m often forced to walk, or even stop completely. but this is good, i need to force myself to slow down in the early stages of these races. too often in my fledgling ultra career i’ve set off too fast, too eager, and i’ve ended up being that guy slumped by the side of the trail at 90km, not sure how i’m going to continue. not this time, i tell myself, as i wait for another bottleneck to clear. the night ticks slowly by, traipsing up and down through woodland trails, following the highway of head torches, until the chilly morning emerges suddenly and we find ourselves face to face with the immensity of tre cime, a huge trio of rocky peaks that seem otherworldly in the dawn light."
"after some pasta soup at a crowded aid station – who knew mini star-shaped pasta floating in vegetable stock could taste so good? – we begin the first long descent back down into the valley. these mountain races are, of course, a series of climbs and descents, and until today i’ve always struggled with both, having come to ultras from road running. but today, finally, it all starts to make sense. on the climbs, i have a new friend, a pair of leki hiking poles. i’ve always been resistant to using poles in races. it reinforces the walking element of mountain trail running, which i try to ignore. i like to think of myself as a runner, not a hiker. this is ultra running, i tell myself, not ultra hiking. besides, the runners i’m most impressed by, people such as kilian jornet and zach miller, seem to cope just fine without them. but the truth is that in a 120km mountain race like this, i’m going to spend a fair amount of time hiking up steep climbs, and poles certainly look like they might help. when i ran the100 mile sud de francein october, i was pretty much the only person in the race without poles. of course, you’re supposed to practice with poles before you use them. so you don’t trip yourself up. so you know how to store them when you’re not using them. so any number of a thousand possible unseen problems can be avoided in advance of the race. but practising with poles when you don’t live near any mountains is not easy. i tried them out on the coast path near my home in devon, but the climbs are so short – even though they can be very steep – that i’m forever putting the poles away and getting them out again. it’s all good pole practice, but it slows your run down. so i do it once. it doesn’t seem so difficult. in the event, the race becomes the practice. by the time i’m finished, i have it nailed. i barely grip the poles, but let them mostly dangle in the straps around my wrists. that works better, and doesn’t rub my hands. and they really seem to help. it’s like having a rail to hold on to up the biggest ascents. throughout the race, even though getting them out of my bag is a hassle, i use them on every climb. but it is the descents where things really click for me. i keep waiting for my legs to start complaining, but on each downhill i just let myself go, flying and skipping along through the field. from 900th position at the first checkpoint in the race, about 10 miles in, i gain around 100 places on every descent. people look at me racing by, particularly near the end, with a touch of annoyance. it does seem a little unfair to be making up so much ground on the downhills. they’re the easy bit. but why doesn’t everyone else go a bit faster?"
"i know why. i’ve been there before, where your legs are so tired that even going downhill is a struggle, where your legs don’t want to, or can’t, lift your feet from the ground. where all you can do to stop yourself sitting down is to keep up a slow, pained, forward shuffle. but after 10 ultra races, for the first time, i’m not that guy. i’m that other guy. the one who comes from nowhere, full of energy, skipping past you, and you think,bloody show off. in the end, i finish, 120km later and in 366th position, back in the buzzing town of cortina. twenty-one and a half hours. i grab my free beer and sit down in the square to take it all in. something has shifted. my whole perception of time and distance seems to have changed, because suddenly it doesn’t seem that crazy to have been out running for so long. when i started ultra running, the thought of running for more than four hours felt a little insane. i remember the first time my gps clicked past 30 miles and finding it hard to process. but now, well it seems sort of normal. seventy-five miles is a long run, sure. but not that long. still, i’m shivering and tired and night is falling, so i’m grateful that giovanni, the owner ofhotel villa argentina, is a runner and has given everyone in the race his phone number so that when we finish he will come and pick us up and scoot us back to the hotel bar for pizza and lemon soda, followed by a long, warm bath. all those things that are just bloody incredible after a long run. even if it’s only a 21.5-hour-long run."
"neuroscientists have studied treadmill runners, ultramarathon athletes – and a number of lab animals – to investigate the effects of running on grey matter the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. it may seem obvious – as you push on through a long run, veering wildly between sensations of agony and elation – that running can have a huge effect on your state of mind. it is an intuitive idea that a growing number of neuroscientists have begun to take seriously, and in recent years they have started to show us what actually plays out on the hills and valleys of your grey matter as you run. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. their findings confirm what many runners know from their own experience: we can use running as a tool to improve the way we think and feel. and we are now learning preciselywhyrunning can return focus, vanquish stress and improve mood. plus we know why – if you’re lucky – you might get a brief glimpse of nirvana. it would be crazy to believe that running is a universal solution to all of our psychological challenges. indeed, from your brain’s perspective, you may not want to push it too hard. german neuroscientists scanned the brains of some of the competitors before, during, and after thetranseurope foot race, in which competitors slog through 3,000 miles, over 64 consecutive days. in the middle of this absurdly extreme ultramarathon, the runners’ grey matter hadshrunk in volume by 6%: the ‘normal’ shrinkage associated with old age is just 0.2% each year. luckily, the story doesn’t end too badly: eight months later the runners’ brains were back to normal. but if covering immense distances can be counter-productive, it is clear now that more moderate runs can result in very real benefits. first, in a world where smartphones bombard us with stimulation and blur the boundaries between work and life, a clutch of recent studies shows why going for a run can help regain a sense of control. a2018 experimentfrom west michigan university, for example, showed that running quickly for half an hour improves “cortical flicker frequency” threshold. this is associated with the ability to better process information. two others, from the lithuanian sports university and nottingham trent university, showed that interval running improves aspects of “executive function”. this is a suite of mental high-level faculties that include the ability to marshall attention, tune out distractions, switch between tasks and solve problems. among the young people studied, measurable gains were clear immediately after10 minutesof interval sprints. they also accumulated afterseven weeksof training. a brainimaging studyled by david raichlen at the university of arizona ties in neatly with these results. they saw clear differences in brain activity in serious runners, compared to well-matched non-runners. for obvious reasons, you cannot run while you are inside a brain scanner, so the neuroscientists studied the brain at rest."
"first, they saw increased co-ordinated activity in regions, mainly at the front of the brain, known to be involved in executive functions and working memory. this makes sense. second, they saw relative damping down of activity in the “default mode network”, a series of linked brain regions that spring into action whenever we are idle or distracted. your default mode network is the source of your inner monologue, the instigator of mind-wandering and the voice that ruminates on your past. its effects are not always welcome or helpful, and have been associated withclinical depression. raichlen’s was a preliminary study, but if corroborated in the future, it will lend fresh weight to the idea that running can be a form of moving mindfulness meditation. brain scans show thatmeditationand running can have a somewhat similar effect on the brain; simultaneously engaging executive functions and turning down the chatter of the default mode network. again, this seems intuitively right: in the midst of a run, you are likely to be immersed in the present moment, tuned into your bodily state, and conscious of your breath. these are all key aims of mindfulness-based practices. lacing up your trainers and going for a run could, therefore, be a way to reap some of the psychological benefits of mindfulness. companies, too, are cottoning on to the therapeutic effects of running: i recently worked with running-shoe companysauconyto create apodcastabout the effects of running on the mind. all of this might start to explain why some people find that running, like mindfulness, can be a useful way to overcome stress and depression. recent research from the karolinska institute in sweden shows, at a chemical level, how running can defuse at least one important biological stress pathway. when you are under stress, metabolic processes in your liver convert the amino acid tryptophan into a molecule with the mumble-inducing name of knyurenine. some of that knyurenine finds its way into your brain, where its accumulation has been stronglyassociatedwith stress-induced depression, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. when you exercise, the levels of an enzyme called kynurenine aminotransferase build up in your muscles. this enzyme breaks down knyurenine into the related molecule kynurenic acid, which, importantly, cannot enter the brain. in this way, exercising your skeletal muscles by runningclears from your bloodstreama substance that can cause mental health problems. it is important to note that, for technical and ethical reasons, some of the details of this mechanism have been proven only inlaboratory animals. at first glance, it is not obvious why working your leg muscles should have a direct effect on your mental state. this work provides rare insight into the often-mysterious links between brain and body – and is a powerful reminder that your brain is just another bodily organ. what you choose to do with your body will, inevitably, have psychological consequences. running can do more for your mood than smooth out stress. some lucky souls gloat about their experiences of the “runner’s high”, which, they claim, is a powerful feeling of ecstasy andinvincibility."
"running has never quite done that for me, but we do now know more about the potent chemical rewards that running triggers in the brain. the popular idea of the “endorphin rush” was born in the 1980s and 90s, when a series of studies showed that the levels ofbeta-endorphin increasein your bloodstream during the course of a run. beta-endorphin targets the same receptors as opiates, and has some similar biological effects. the endorphin rush hypothesis always had a flaw, however, since beta-endorphin does not cross readily the blood-brain barrier. and if it didn’t make it into your brain, how could it give you a high? in 2008, german neuroscientists put that right. they usedfunctional brain imaging to showthat, in trained runners, beta-endorphin levels do indeed spike in the brain after a two-hour run. increased levels endorphin activity in the brain also correlated with the runners’ self-reported feelings of euphoria. it is not just home-brew opiates that can dull the pain and raise your spirits while you are on the run. endocannabinoids are a diverse family of bodily chemicals which, like cannabis, bind the brain’s cannabinoid receptors. the levels of endocannabinoids circulating in the blood rises after 30 minutes ofmoderately intense treadmill running.rigorous experiments, conducted on lab mice, show that running-induced endocannabinoids are responsible forreductions in anxiety and perception of pain. it is a good bet that the same mechanism works in our minds. for many of us, running may never deliver a drug-like high. but we now see why a run that feels like murder at the start can leave you feel satisfied and at ease by the home straight. some of these studies are preliminary and need fleshing out. and it is definitely the case that your gender, genetic profile, fitness, expectations and many other factors besides will influence the way your brain responds to running. even so, i read all these neuroscientific studies as good news stories. while the physical benefits of running and aerobic exercise are well established, we are starting to see why running can have profound benefits for mental health, too. hopefully, knowing this will redouble your determination to get out there and run more often. ben tweets at@mountainogre"
"the utmb is a serious challenge – at 105 miles, with a route that ascends 34,000ft, and traverses three different countries. but just getting through the qualifying races is an epic feat in itself when you tell otherultra runnersthat you are training for theultra-trail du mont- blanc(utmb), they give you a certain look. oh, you are a serious ultra runner. you can almost feel your trail cred rising. not because theutmbis the toughest race, or the longest, or in the most extreme conditions – although it is fairly extreme, being a 105-mile race around mont blanc that traverses a route with a total ascent of 34,000ft (10,300m) and passes through three different countries. the main reason they give you that subtle nod of kudos is because just qualifying for the utmb is an epic feat in itself. to even enter the ballot for a place, you have to accumulate points by running three qualifying races. while you do not need to win or do particularly well in any of these races – unless you’re shooting for an elite place at the utmb – you do need to finish them all within the cut-offs. that might sound reasonable, but the three races i had to do last year to accumulate my points included a 135-mile run around the welshisle of anglesey, and a100-mile slogup and down the slopes of the pyrenees in the south of france. both these races have drop-out rates of around 40%. the second one took me almost 40 hours, running non-stop through two nights, hallucinating cocktail parties on candlelit verandas along the way, and leaving my toes feeling numb for months after. and that is just to qualify for the ballot. but now i have a place. the utmb is also the most competitive ultra trail in the world, with more of the top elite runners turning up each year, treating it as the grand final, the unofficial world championships of the sport. i have no illusions about being competitive anywhere near the front of this race, but after just over a year of ultra running, when something has gone wrong in every race i have run, i am working on being as good as i can be, for what will be the culmination of my two-year ultra running adventure. it began last february when i decided to shoot for the utmb and ran the first qualifying race, and my first ever ultra, a 35-mile jaunt along the coastal path near my home in south devon. since then, i have got lost in races, worn the wrong shoes, forgotten to carry water, had extreme lows – clinging to the side of a mountain during a storm in the night –and extreme highs, when i felt like superman, flying up holyhead mountain 130 miles into thering o fire anglesey race, unable to believe that these legs that had struggled even to walk a few hours earlier now felt brand new, straight out of the box and filled with rocket fuel."
"and so, with my entry to the utmb confirmed, last weekend i took on one of two final warm-up races before the big one. it was a mere45-mile race along the jurassic coastin dorset. “just a baby ultra,” i kept telling people beforehand. my latest lesson in this sport is never to underestimate an ultra race. the numbers in ultra running are so big and insane that they start to become meaningless in the space between the races, when you’re talking and thinking about them rather than actually running them. after some of the races i had already done, 45 miles seemed like nothing. that was until about 20 miles in, when i started cramping while climbing up some steps after running alonglulworth cove beach. it was a hot day and i hadn’t taken in enough salt. luckily the cramps went away, but then came three brutal hills in quick succession, cliffs, pure vertical madness, interspersed, of course, by three terrifying descents. by then, i was on the point of dropping out. i had my reasons clearly laid out in my mind. this was only a training race, and so 25 miles was quite far enough for a training run. and it was dangerous to run with cramps – they had come back a few times on those three hills. what if i got stuck on my own somewhere remote and couldn’t even walk. it was irresponsible to carry on. but something, and it is still hard for me to fathom quite what it is, pushed me on. every time i resolved to stop, it said no. go on, go a bit further. after a while, the miles still left to go and the distances already run started to blur, and my mind stopped counting, focused completely on the simple act of moving, even if it was merely shuffling. the cliff paths and seaside towns were full of holidaymakers enjoying a balmy weekend. i ran through them with my rucksack and the number pinned on my shirt like an oddball. but word of who we were had got out, and people cheered me on, telling me i was amazing, telling me to keep going. i tried to wave or smile back. when did i become the maddest guy in town? there were moments of exquisite beauty, when you would come across an isolated cove that took your breath away. in these ultras, you are so raw, that everything is more extreme. a hug from a loved one at an aid station, or the sudden appearance of nature in full bloom, can bring you close to tears. but you must go on. perpetual forward motion is the goal. race positions stop mattering – it ceases to become a race. i had started out with a goal time and position, but six hours on, none of that mattered. all that mattered was to keep moving, one step after another. the race ended atold harry rocks. it was a setting to lift the spirits, but just finishing was ecstasy."
"to sit on the warm grass, take off my shoes and stare out to sea after eight and a half hours of running. in that moment, it all made sense. and so i have one more warm-up race left to go. a78-mile run through the dolomitesin italy. it is a scary prospect, lots more big numbers, but for now i am going to bask a little longer in the glory of another ultra completed. another step along this crazy path i set out on when i decided, last february, to enter the utmb."
"as i trudged up scafell pike, i saw ricky lightfoot on his way down, on his way to setting a new course record. it made me reconsider how i’d previously felt about underprepared race stragglers ... ‘oh boy,” i thought, watching a tiny figure descend through the mist towards me. he was heading back towards the fork in the path where i knew he should have turned right. “that guy is in trouble.” i was about a third of the way round thescafell pike trail marathonbut he, it turns out, was not. he wasn’t in trouble. he was ricky lightfoot and he had taken that right, done a loop of the summit and was now heading swiftly back down in perfect accordance withnominative determinism. he was about two hours ahead of me –going by my speed, not his – and well on his way to setting a course record for the race we were both (supposedly) running. i trudged on up through the mist. i had trained hard for this event: i’d banked plenty of quality miles, run shorter fell races and got in a fair whack of hill training. it wasn’t enough. as i clomped up the severe, boulder-strewn flank of england’s highest peak i reflected on the steep, technical training that west yorkshire hadn’t offered me and my failure to seek it out elsewhere. this was my fourth marathon, and it was not going well. a year or so earlier, i was running the edinburgh marathon, a race that has a kinda-sorta out-and-back route, watching people go past me in the opposite direction. i was somewhere around mile 24 and on track for a respectable but thoroughly unremarkable sub-four-hour time. they were somewhere around mile 11, and already walking. it stuck right in my craw. i had trained hard, put in the miles, stuck to a plan and made a proper go of it. these day hikers clearly hadn’t. they hadn’t respected the distance, hadn’t felt the need to train properly and weren’t looking great for finishing inside the cut-off. i felt blearily indignant, personally affronted that these people thought they could just saunter through an event that i had trained hard for. as i blundered down scafell pike, now more than two hours after my lightfoot sighting, i considered the fact that if i just relaxed a little along the tough, technical descent, i would probably roll an ankle. there would be no choice: i would have to drop out and i wouldn’t have to tell anyone that i just wasn’t up to it. ireallywanted to not be running. i didn’t relax, though. yet another few miles along, the route left the lake shore to swerve up another hill. purely, i think, to round the mileage up to the required 26.2. i cursed the race planners and fought the urge to throw my pack on the floor in a hissy fit. when i finally tramped over the finish line i had been out running for seven hours and 40 minutes, almost double my fastest road marathon time."
"the annoying, radio-friendly house music the organisers had been playing at the finish had stopped by this point and there were just a few people left milling around. i was not quite the last, but i came 128th in a field of 154 finishers and was one of the few runners in that back 50 who didn’t fall into one of the senior categories. it took quite a while for me to draw a line between those mile-11 edinburgh runners and myself, but i got there eventually. i am quite proud of my seven-hour, 40-minute scafell pike marathon. it was the best i was able to do at the time, somewhere out beyond the limits of any endurance event i’d done previously. but along with those mile-11 edinburgh runners, i knew was part of a group you might call undertrained and underprepared; or who you might – if you were feeling more generous – consider to be stretching ourselves and redefining what we deem possible. it might depend on whether we have had the self-awareness to stand well back from the start line where we can’t get in your way. the scafell pike race was my last marathon. as i hobbled past that mercifully silent sound system, though, i learned that i could run for well over seven hours. that knowledge eventually led me to guess that i could probably run 100km, which in turn pointed me towards my upcoming attempt at 100 miles, a distance that was utterly incomprehensible to me a few years ago. i will almost certainly finish at the back of that pack, too. if there’s a crap dj who’s already gone home by the time i stagger over the finish line, that will be fine. mark e johnson is a writer and a runner. you can find him oninstagramor (occasionally) his food site,yorkshire grub"
"he spent 46 days running more than 2,000 miles through the appalachian mountains – what got him through it? at home, it’s a smoothie: fruit, greens, nuts, nut butter or flax oil and protein powder. then, before my morning workout, some oatmeal and wholegrain toast with more nut butter. on a normal day i do 3,000-4,000 calories. when i was doing theappalachian trail, though, that went up to 6,000-8,000 cals and i still lost 8.6kg over the 46 days. breakfast there was at 5am: a banana, a cliff bar, and, my daily comfort, a coconut-milk cappuccino. i do all the cooking, and lunch is usually leftovers from the night before. on the trail, my wife jenny and i were living in a van and, twice a day, she’d bring me a sandwich, or something warm – fries, hashbrowns, whatever she could find in the local diners or supermarkets that was vegan. on an ultramarathon, i snack twice an hour on sports gels and energy bars. at home it’s lighter: fresh fruit, popcorn, a second smoothie if i’m doing an afternoon workout. and lots of water, although i go by thirst as opposed to measuring it out. on the trail, i’d long for homely dinners with a beer and some friends – thai curries, slow-cooked soups, stews … north: finding my way while running the appalachian trailis out on 12 april (random house books)"
"they are an almost-impossible test of the human body and spirit, yet the number of ultramarathons has increased 1,000% over the last decade. adharanand finn asks what’s behind this rapid increase – and whether racing 100 miles or more is actually good for you awhile ago, i was standing at the office tea point when a colleague who had heard i was a runner asked me if i did ultramarathons – the term for any foot race longer than the 26.2 miles of a standard marathon. he looked disappointed when i told him i didn’t. “triathlons?” he asked. i shook my head. “oh, just marathons?” in terms of impressing work colleagues, family and friends, it seems marathons no longer cut it. we are in the post-marathon age, when everybody knows somebody who has run a marathon. now, it seems, a genuinely impressive feat has to be something longer and more extreme. fifty miles is ok, but it’s better if you can reel off numbers in the hundreds, and preferably over an insanely steep mountain range, a desert or some perilous jungle. with more and more stories of ultra races circulating, you have to feel sorry for the person looking for sponsorship for a little marathon jaunt. but what is behind this inflation? why are more and more people taking on races than can last days rather than hours? and is it any good for us? steve diederich runs therun ultra websitewhich lists the world’s biggest ultramarathons. he says that when he set up the site 12 years ago he found 160 races listed globally. this year he has over 1,800 races on the site – an increase of over 1,000%. thegerman ultrarunning website duvadditionally lists the results of many smaller ultra races, its database going all the way back to the first 89km london to brighton footrace in 1837. over the last 10 years it plots a similar 1,000% increase in the number of races. ultra running magazinein the us collates figures for north america, and again they tell a similar story of a rapidly rising sport, with the number of races and finishers increasing every year since 1981. in 2003, for example, almost 18,000 people in north america finished an ultramarathon. last year the number was 105,000. and asia, too, has seen an explosion in the number of races. nic tinworth, a race director in hong kong, says that 10 years ago there were six ultra races in the territory, but that now there are more than 60. “in previous years,” he says, “you could just turn up on the day and enter, but now the most popular races sell out in minutes.” many of the world’s most oversubscribed races, such as theultra-trail de mont-blancin france and thewestern states 100in the us, have had to implement lottery systems to cope with the numbers wanting to take part. diederich manages the entries for themarathon des sables– one of the most iconic ultras, traversing 156 miles of the sahara desert. despite the £4,250 entry fee, diederich says the race sells out in minutes."
"so why are ever more people putting themselves through challenges that for most of us are barely imaginable? since that conversation at the tea point, i have actually completed a number of ultramarathons. the intial attraction was the call of the wild. i had run six marathons when someone suggested i run the six-day, 165kmoman desert marathon. as a runner the race held little appeal, but as a life experience, an adventure, it was exciting: to cross a vast stretch of barely charted land with only myself and a backpack of energy bars to keep me going, was a thrilling prospect. extreme athletekarl egloffknows the feeling. the ecuadorian has run up and down both kilimanjaro and aconcagua (the highest mountain in the andes) quicker than anyone in history. he says the appeal of racing up the mountains, rather than hiking up them, is the sense of freedom: “when i go up a mountain travelling light and moving quickly, it’s different. i feel free, like flying, like a condor.” while adventure has always appealed to the human spirit, diederich puts the boom down to the growth of social media, which spreads the word and fires people’s imaginations: “people see their friends’ pictures and go, ‘wow, i want to do that,’” he says. some in the ultra world, however, are disdainful of the social media influence, saying it gives rise to people looking for kudos by calling themselves ultrarunners, and the sport has lost its edge as a result. race director mark cockbain says: “so many races have popped up to capitalise on people’s desire to be ultrarunners and organisers make it so easy for runners to achieve this ‘status’ with ‘everyone-that-enters-is-a-winner’ and finisher-hand-holding events. once all ultras had a sense of danger.” paul albion, who organisesbig bear ultra eventsin the midlands, agrees that social media has played a role, but sees the inclusivity as a positive. “with greater exposure to these sorts of events, people see that not all of the finishers are whippet-like men who climb like mountain goats,” he says. “our finishers come in all shapes, sizes and ages.” diederich feels there is a natural race inflation behind the rise in ultras. “so many people have done a marathon, that now if someone tells you they’re running one, you ask if they’re doing it in a panda outfit or something. just running a marathon doesn’t mean much.” another race director, melissa martinez, whoputs on events in north carolina, agrees. “as people continue to see the marathon as more achievable,” she says “the human spirit will always crave more. it will always crave that feeling of pushing itself to the edge, and then continuing on in spite of the pain.” i often hear ultrarunners talking about pain and finding their limits. at theself-transcendence 24-hour track racei ran in south london last year, the race director told me it was to witness that moment when a person finds the strength to carry on, when they thought all was lost, that keeps her putting events on year after year."
"and i can say from experience that to be forced to dig deep inside yourself, to face pain and doubt, and yet to come through it, can be a life-affirming experience. lindley chambers, chairman of thetrail running association, says the ever-growing contrast between our normal, sedate lives and the feeling you get in an ultra of being fully alive and on the edge is key to the sport’s growing appeal. as the world becomes ever more sanitised and automated, where even cars drive themselves, a deep stirring grows to get out of our comfort zone, to feel something of our wilder selves. “as our regular, mundane lives become ever more sedentary,” he says, “we have a need for something more.” it was this need that first drew me to the desert in oman, and it was there, on the start line on the last day, that i met a german couple in their late 60s. they looked completely shattered after five days pushing themselves on through the scorching heat. “why do we do this?” gudrun asked rhetorically. “we have such a nice home.” her husband, hansmartin, looked at her and said simply: “because we have such a nice home.” in the brilliant documentarythe barkley marathons: the race that eats its young, one competitor in the 100-mile race puts it more bluntly: “most people would be better off with more pain in their lives.” getting through the pain barrier, the wall, pushing beyond your limits, was once part of the appeal of standard marathons. but, according to ultrarunner nick mead, the feeling you get, the fabled runner’s high, is proportionally bigger in an ultramarathon. after completing his first ultra,mead wrote: “the race pounded me almost into submission before i broke through and was lifted on a wave of euphoria unlike anything i’ve ever experienced … an almost spiritual high.” in his autobiography, ultra legend scott jurek describes being driven by a similar feeling: “the longer and farther i ran, the more i realised that what i was often chasing was a state of mind – a place where worries that seemed monumental melted away, where the beauty and timelessness of the universe, of the present moment, came into sharp focus.” the euphoria of running has indeed been proven to help relieve stress and alleviate depression, but does running further feel even better? catra corbet is a former addict who took up ultrarunning after she got arrested for drug dealing. “i’m always high out on the trails,” she says, when i meet her at a roadside starbucks somewhere near her home in san francisco. she’s 53 but looks about 28, with red hair, tattoos cascading down her arms and legs, and piercings all over her face. she has run 100 miles (in one go) over 130 times. “i like to do one or two 100-milers a month,” she says, as though they are trips to the beach. “running saved my life. people go to aa or whatever, but i don’t."
"my recovery is out on the trail.” yet, while it may bring a feeling of wellbeing, can running a hundred miles or more, often through the night and through challenging terrain, really be good for your body? in 2012, cardiologist-runners carl lavie and james o’keefe caused a stir when theyreleased a research paperthat found that while moderate running was clearly healthy, those health benefits began to tail off and possibly even reverse if you ran “excessively”. initially they defined that as more than 2.5 hours a week – though after further research lavie revised it to five hours a week. ultrarunners, of course, undertake much more than that, often in a single day. lavie and o’keefe’s main concern was heart damage and a hardening of the tissue around the heart brought on by extreme exercise. in ated talk on the subject, o’keefe said that while exercise was one of the best medicines for good all-round health, “like any drug, there’s an ideal dose range. if you don’t take enough, you don’t get the benefits. if you take too much, it could be harmful. maybe even fatal.” mark hines is a professional adventurer, author and an exercise physiologist. he shares the health concerns about ultrarunning. “the biggest issue is permanent scarring of the heart tissue,” he says. “anyone middle-aged running a marathon or more is likely to develop some level of scarring, and it is irreversible.” lavie and o’keefe were accused of putting people off running, and are now keen to stress that any exercise is better than no exercise. dr andrew murray, a sports and exercise medicine consultant at the university of edinburgh, who once ran 4,300km over 78 days from john o’groats to the sahara desert, emphasises the point: “there is a ceiling [in the amount of running you do] beyond which you start to lose the sweet spot healthwise. however it is very difficult to do enough to return you to a greater risk than couch potatoes.” the problem with relating o’keefe’s study to ultrarunning is that he conflates intensity and duration of exercise to define “extreme”.ultrarunningmay, on the surface, seem to be extreme, but in practice it is usually undertaken at a very low intensity – with walking forming a large chunk of most ultra races for most competitors. indeed, hines says he has started running longer races since he learned about the risk of heart scarring, because, he says, they are generally safer due to the lower intensity of effort. in 2014, dr martin hoffman, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the university of california,ran a more specific studyon health issues related to more than 1,200 ultrarunners. he concluded that they were healthier than the non-ultrarunning population, with a low prevalence of virtually all serious medical issues, and that they had fewer sick days off work. “at present,” he told me, “there is no good evidence to prove there are negative long-term health consequences from ultramarathon running.” but are ultramarathon runners doing it to be healthy? no one i spoke to cited that as the reason."
"hoffman followed up his research with a fascinating question posed to another 1,394 ultrarunners: “if you were to learn, with absolute certainty, that ultramarathon running is bad for your health, would you stop?” seventy-four per cent of runners responded: “no”. adharanand finn is the author of a forthcoming book on ultrarunning, to be published by guardian faber in may 2019. thebarkley marathonsis a 100-mile, unmarked trail race in tennessee inspired by a 1977 prison escape. the brutal course and quirks of the race, such as an unknown start time, make this race so tough thatin its 33 years only 15 people have ever finished. the sri-chinmoy self transcendence 3100 mile raceloops around a single block in queens, new york city – that’s 5,649 laps. this is officially the longest race in the world, and one of the least scenic. the fastest-ever winning time was 40 days and 9 hours. the tunnel ultrais 200 miles back and forth through the uk’s longest foot tunnel, situated under bath in somerset. race director mark cockbain calls it “a mindbending test of extreme endurance and sensory deprivation”. 6633 arctic ultracalls itself the “toughest, coldest, windiest ultra distance footrace on the planet”. crossing the arctic circle and traversing 350 miles of snow, ice and temperatures down to -50c, it is limited to 12 starters, of whom all but a couple will drop out before the end. the spineis a self-supporting, self-navigating race along the full route of the 268-milepennine wayfrom edale in derbyshire to kirk yetholm, scotland. in january. while most of the running time takes place at night, runners often have to contend with snow, sleet or driving rain. the course record is 95 hours 17 minutes."
"when faced with donald trump’s plans to destroy areas of astounding beauty and cultural significance, an eclectic group of runners and native americans joined together to have their voices heard when an eclectic group of ultra-runners and members of the navajo nation were faced withdonald trump’s plans to destroy their natural playground, they protested in the only way they could – they ran. if you asked the average runner what they enjoy most about their weekend runs they would probably all say something slightly different. but when you delve far enough under the surface, it all boils down to the same elusive concept: freedom. and nothing symbolises the liberating thrill of connecting to nature more than running through the panoramic expanses ofutah’s bears earsandgrand staircasenational monuments. so, when donald trump announced plans to sweep all of this away in the largest elimination of public land in us history, the obvious thing for runners and film-makers johnie gall, andy cochrane and greg balkin to do was to bring everyone together and run across it in six mile relays – all 250 miles of it – in a single weekend. the result is one of the most inspirational and unique environmental protest films you’re likely to see. “the idea was to use something we love – running – to celebrate the area and the immense cultural significance woven into it,” explains cochrane. “we wanted to explore south-eastern utah first-hand and build a relationship with the canyons, towers, mesas and the dirt, to better understand why the land – and places like it across the country – should stay public and protected.” and besides from their passion for the sport, gall feels running is the perfect way to illustrate this. “when you have to carry your body across an entire landscape, you appreciate it differently. the speed of running allows you to see all kinds of nooks and crannies that you wouldn’t otherwise, but it’s still fast enough to cover a lot of ground quickly. in 30 hours, we covered 250 miles from the east side of bears ears to the far end of grand staircase-escalante.” and with some of the most challenging ultra-running trails in the world, it’s also no surprise that the project attracted everyone from the world’s most formidable elite athletes to people who simply love pursuing the childlike wonder that you can only get from such an unforgiving landscape. “the group of 17 runners are all friends and friends of friends. the outdoor industry is a pretty small place once you’re in it”, balkin says. “andy’s biggest passion is trail running and he’s fortunate to have a big network of runners that he was able to tap into, from olympians and professional runners to more casual, recreational runners to navajo runners who consider it a big part of their history.” the navajo have worshipped and lived off the land between the two monuments for centuries."
"there are more than 100,000 native american archaeological and cultural sites in the area – which are still considered sacred by the ancestors of the tribes who worshipped here. as you would expect, they too have been tirelessly campaign to protect the area. in july 2015, leaders from five area tribes founded thebears ears inter-tribal coalition– a consortium of sovereign tribal nations – to make the case for conserving the bears ears cultural landscape. “we have a navajo friend named len necefer who is a pretty vocal member of the outdoor industry,” says gall. “when the idea for the relay came up, we reached out to him to talk about how we could bring a strong navajo voice to the story. he was stoked and helped recruit a few navajo runners for the project. we learned so much from them during the run and have continued to do so since.”far from sitting back with their feet in ice buckets, all three film-makers continue to dedicate themselves to the wilderness. it’s a way of living that sometimes flippantly earns them the nickname of ‘dirtbags’. but cochrane doesn’t mind. “dirtbag is a term of endearment in the outdoor world. it was first used to describe pioneering rock climbers of decades past – guys who would live in tents and eat cat food to have the freedom to pursue rock climbing year-round. all three of us and some of our runners have lived in vans, buses, trucks or tents at some point or another, pursuing our passions.” and as long as the great open spaces we treasure continue to resist the destructive forces of development, we should probably be thankful for all the ‘dirtbags’ championing our running trails."
"east africans dominate long-distance running up to 26.2 miles – but longer races are almost exclusively white affairs. as ever in top-level sport, money has a lot to answer for in the world of ultrarunning, one race stands out as the most competitive, the super bowl, the london marathon of ultrarunning: it is theultra-trail mont blanc. since getting involved in ultrarunning a few years ago, i have followed the race online each august. the start is stirring stuff: more than 2,000 athletes gather inthe town of chamonixin the alps, with the sport’s crème de la crème gathered at the front. these are the supermen and superwomen who will race around the 105-mile route at mind-boggling speeds. they are among the greatest athletes on earth. yet, watching it, i saw a big, red flag flying that no one else seemed to mention. everyone on the start line was white. if these were the world’s greatest distance runners, where were the kenyans? i don’t need to explain to readers of this blog that kenyans, along with their neighbours in ethiopia, dominate the world of long-distance running in distances up to and including the marathon. after that, however, they don’t feature. why? asking people at the centre of the kenyan running world,in the town of iten, about ultrarunning brings mostly puzzled looks. what is this thing you speak of, they ask? running further than a marathon? is that possible? i told one 2hr 4min marathon runner that i had run 100km. he looked at me in disbelief and asked me how many days it had taken. i know 100km is a long way, but if you can do 42km in just over two hours ... well, do the maths, it is less than a day. but the concept was so alien that he couldn’t get his head around it. left with this puzzle, i decided to do something potentially disastrous, but also potentially gamechanging for kenyans and for ultrarunning: i decided to introduce them to each other. the big barrier to this is, of course, was money. in kenya, there are no managers looking for ultrarunners, no one willing to pay for a plane ticket to a race in the hope of cashing in on a share of the winnings. this is because the winnings are small or non-existent.money is a key motivator for many kenyan athletes: running offers them a way to change their lives, to escape poverty and to help their families and communities. they don’t always have the luxury of doing it just for the love of it. yet, as the sport of ultrarunning grows, so do the opportunities to earn money. a handful of top ultrarunners now have agents securing them big sponsorship deals and a few races are putting up big cash prizes in the hope of luring the top competitors. so, for those thousands of kenyans who dedicate themselves to training and live like professional athletes, but who can never get a spot in a road race, ultrarunning could offer an outlet for them to express their talents."
"not everyone in ultrarunning loves this idea. one senior person in an ultrarunning company told me he hoped kenyans would never discover ultrarunning, for fear they would “kill it by winning all the races”. he said he believed it was a question of branding, that people don’t care when a kenyan wins a marathon, because they are “machines made for running”. but kenyan runners are not machines: they work hard to achieve what they do and they deserve the same opportunities as everyone else. their stories are just as compelling if people take the time to listen. luckily the rest of the ultrarunning community has been more welcoming, with top us runners sage canaday and gary gellin alreadyputting some money forward to help the project. ultrarunner zach miller told me he would relish the opportunity to race some top kenyans and had invited them to train with him in colorado. my belief is that kenyans taking part in ultrarunning can only elevate the sport and add another layer of interest by making it even more competitive. it will be a global sport only when its doors are open to everyone. so, a wheel has been spun. some friends in california and i are crowdfunding to cover the costs for two kenyans to train for and race inthe lake sonoma 50-mile ultra racein northern california in april. the race team is delighted, with race director john medinger saying he was “thrilled to have them” at sonoma. convincing kenyans to take up the challenge has not been easy, but two athletes agreed to put their marathon-running aspirations on hold for a few months to see what would happen if they took to the trails. the first is francis bowen, a 2hr 8min marathon runner at his best (he ran his pb in 2011). now 43, francis may be the fastest marathon runner ever to try a trail ultra. that is an exciting prospect. the second is risper kimaiyo, who has in fact run one ultramarathon, the 50km world championship in 2016 in qatar.she won. “i just enjoy running long distance,” she says. she trained in south africa for a while – where ultrarunning is more common – and says she used to run 70km every saturday. that is why she decided to put herself forward for the world championships. “i went to qatar and i came up liking it [ultrarunning],” she says. yet, despite being the world champion, she hasn’t been able to race an ultra since. the opportunity just didn’t exist. until now. to help francis and risper train for and travel to the lake sonoma 50,please pledge your support here."
"how can a runner celebrate their birthday? by running their age in miles or km this week i turned 30. my to-do list for the day read: i can’t stand the fake intimacy of general, automated emails, so no 3 acts as a good annual cull. and i’ve never understood why birthdays are about celebrating the child for a passive act of which they have no recollection rather than the mother for whom it was probably arduous and highly memorable, hence the flowers. but throughout my adult life, i have found myself at a loss for what to do with the rest of the day. eating cake is undoubtedly pleasurable but, as an ultrarunner, it is also an at-least-daily occurrence. so, from now on, i intend to run my age in kilometres each year. cynics will no doubt point out that i have taken the easy option by choosing metric rather then imperial measurement. but 30 miles before work seemed a tall order and i need to think a few decades ahead. it turns out i am far from being the first to adopt this annual tradition.david mcgillivray, the race director for the boston marathon, has been running his age in miles since his 12th birthday, back in 1966. he was still going strong at 60. ultrarunning is, after all, a sport for the older runner. theaverage age of participants is 43and runners in their 60s, 70s and 80s are not uncommon. and records for mature runners continue to fall. at 70,bob beckercompleted the notoriousbadwater ultra(135 miles) in 41 hours.gunhild swanson, also 70, finished the gruelling 100-mile western states race. and in 2016,ed whitlockbecame the oldest sub-four-hour marathon runner at the incredible age of 85 (he also held the sub-three-hour record at 74). with this sort of pedigree, the birthday ritual could be continued almost indefinitely – provided, of course, it doesn’t hasten life’s final ribbon. have any of the guardian running community been following similar traditions? does anyone want to start? i can attest that it definitely makes the cake taste better ..."
"offering beautiful views, steep flights of stairs and the option of post-run pizza refuelling, the paths of the amalfi coast are a trail runners paradise the amalfi coast is stunning - and hotels and restaurants in the area can have prices to match, particularly in high season. so the best option, particularly for a group or a family, is to hire a villa. theluxury travel bookhave numerous properties along the whole amalfi coast (and the rest of italy, and indeed beyond) ranging from €700 (£613) for a week to the sky-is-the-limit. we stayed in the beautifulviale pasitea, a split level property (you can hire it as separate apartments, or as one huge villa) with a beautiful terrace over the sea. the full property, beautifully furnished with classic pieces and comfortable beds and sofas, will comfortably sleep 12 people, and the bedrooms are generous, with plenty of space for as many outfits as you could possibly bring. after all, to fit in in stylish positano, you need multiple wardrobe changes daily ... the villa is right in the heart of the town, up (or down) one of the innumerable steps that criss-cross positano, and indeed the whole coast. down the steps is the main beach, where you can sunbathe, look beautiful or scoff gelato while waiting for one of the local ferries, which can take you to naples, sorrento, amalfi, or the islands of ischia and capri. up a few flights is an excellent local minimarket after an active day working up a sweat on those trails, it is the perfect retreat. positano can be busy at peak times, but shut the gate to the villa’s garden terrace and you are in sunny oasis of calm, the perfect spot for sipping a well-earned aperol spritz. the kitchen, too, is excellent: huge and remarkable well-equipped, ideal for whipping up pasta. if the evening is still warm you can dine on the terrace, if a nip is in the air then the large dining table inside. oh, and there is - of course - excellent wi-fi, so you can upload your day’s activities to strava the second you are back. who wouldn’t want to walk in the steps of the gods? or, at any rate, run and/or hike thepath of the gods. this stunning route winds through and along the sheer cliffs of the amalfi oast. around every corner is a view of the sparkling mediterranean, or a bird’s eye glimpse of the coastal towns and villages, like so many dolls houses interspersed with the dark green of olive tree foliage. the full path is about 13km (8 miles), and you can travel it in either direction, though the views are better if you go from east to west (starting in bomerano, ending in nocelle, just outside positano). moving in that direction means the best views are always in front of you, and also means the sun will be behind you in the morning – better for both taking photos and not boiling if you are there in the summer heat."
"this direction also gives you slightly more downhill, though the trail is technical at times, and there certainly plenty of unrunnable stretches – and why would you want to hurry anyway? some parts of the path also require careful map reading – for which i thoroughly recommendthis guide/leafletwith helpful photos fromgiovanni visetti.this detailed guideis also worth printing out, as it lists some picturesque views/pit stops for water en route. for those who prefer a smoother surface, road running is possible. you just need to keep your wits about you, andget up very early. the roads along the coast soon become very congested with slow-moving coaches (followed inches behind by impatient italian drivers) and there aren’t any pavements to speak of, so you are taking your life into your own hands. a much better option – if you don’t want to embark on a long trail run – is to find a quiet stretch of hill path and run hill repeats. of course, you could enter an organised race. the stunningamalfi coast trailtakes place on 26 march and is a stage race totalling 94km, with 5,300 metres of elevation gain. it’s a very small race, of just 40 runners, with an option for 20 trekkers too – this is split over five stages, so it is entirely doable with a reasonable level of fitness. it also functions as an active form of run-tourism itself, incorporating a visit to pompeii, a section taking in vesuvius and a start on the island of capri. another beautiful option in the early summer is theamalfi-positano ultra trail, taking place on 26 may 2018. this is actually a series of races, from the50k ‘full’ ultra, down through a 35km ‘trail of the sirens’ to a 17km ‘trail of the gods’. the same organisers also run the wonderful-soundingamalfi positano wine trail, two races in the furore vineyards, on 27 october. then there is the newcoast to coastrace, travelling from sorrento direct to positano. last year’s race comprised an ultra – 54km – and a shorter, 28km race, as well as a 2km funrun open to all. the dates for 2018 haven’t yet been announced, but it’s likely to be in december. then, of course, there’s a marathon (isn’t there always?). the naples marathon takes place later in the year – date, again, tbc – but thehalf marathontakes place on 4 feb. and really, what better place in the world could there be for pre-race carb loading than the birthplace of the pizza? an important note for all racers, however: in italy (as in france) it is mandated by law that you must present a medical certificate, authorised or signed by a doctor, to prove you are fit enough to run. many races provide a sample form that you can print out and bring to your gp (who may or may not charge a small fee). driving in italy is, well, less than relaxing."
"getting our hire car back from positano through a thunderstorm, around coastal winding roads, during rush hour, to naples was an experience i never, ever wish to relive. but providing you don’t mind public transport and can live without your own car, it’s entirely possible to get from naples to positanoby bus– there are two direct ones each morning, or you could get the hourly train to sorrento then a bus onwards from there. or you could even explore the ferry timetable, to do part of the journey by sea. a more pricey option is to hire a taxi, though you could save some money by sharing ashuttle."
"it’s a simple conceit – a slightly more than four-mile loop that you run once an hour until all your competitors have dropped out. all very straightforward, until you hear how far the winner ran .... run a single loop measuring 4.16667 miles within a single hour. now do it again. and again. now keep doing it – starting a new loop on the hour, regardless of how fast you finish the previous one – until there’s only one runner willing or capable of doing so. welcome to the simple – some might say sadistic – concept of thebig dog backyard ultrain bedford county, tennessee. “the apparently weird loop-distance has in fact been carefully chosen so each 24 hours equals running a perfect 100 miles,” saysguillaume calmettes, the frenchman who is the current big dog backyard ultra champion. “another twist is that every 12 hours you change between a daytime trail loop to a night-time road loop, and because the road loop has less elevation gain – and is of course less technical – than the trail loop, then reaching the road loops gives you the opportunity to get a bit more rest time in between loops, and more time to take care of yourself before starting the next one.” calmettes winning distance wasan incredible 246 miles. that’s 59 loops over 59 consecutive hours. obviously the bad dog backyard ultra isn’t for everyone. it’s leftfield events like this and theinfamous barkley marathons– both devised by the savant of suffering, lazarus lake – that attract a certain breed of ultra runner. the 2017 edition had one of the deepest fields to date, or as calmettes puts it, “everything you want for good entertainment: barkley finisher; 24hr world championship medalist; badwater champion; vol-state 500k champion; six-day running specialists; 100-mile winners, and so on. it was pretty humbling being surrounded by greatness everywhere,” he says. so how to approach a race with no discernible end – a race where your competitors dwindle as the physiological and psychological torment picks off victim after victim? quite easily, it seems, if you’re calmettes. “because there is no predefined finish, you cannot think in terms of ‘how many miles do i have left before this thing is all over’, so in fact, i found it very easy mentally. i just had to think about the next loop. the next loop, always the next loop, it’s very easy thinking,” he says. “you’re never overwhelmed by what you have left to run, because you simply don’t know what you have left to run.” in this case ignorance is, without doubt, bliss. another unique aspect of the big dog that turns the traditional race experience on it’s head is position. it doesn’t matter if you finish a loop quickest or slowest. once you finish it within the given hour, every runner begins the new loop tied for first place. in fact, it almost sounds easy. until it sinks in once again that calmettes ran for almost two and a half days straight – through storms and rain – to take the prize."
"it’s a measure of his character that the race’s highpoint for him wasn’t, in fact, winning but a moment when his last surviving rival, harvey lewis, finished loop number 56 with only two seconds to spare. the two took off into the next loop like a couple of sugared up school kids – ticking it off in just 41 minutes. “pushing on a muddy and slippery trail loop with a friend after 57 hours is something special and pretty fun,” he says. the end came soon after, lewis quietly dropping out during the 59th loop – leaving calmettes to unknowingly complete what was to be his final, winning lap. “the problem when you win big dog backyard ultra is that it means that you did not really reach your limits; your race stopped because all the others runners called it quits, not because you decided that it was enough,” he says. “now that i know that i can cover at least 246 miles and stay awake for 59 hours straight, i am even more curious of what i can really do. so yes, i am definitely coming back, and hopefully we’ll hit a third night next year.” as a final, devious twist, the prize for winning is a starting place at the barkley marathons. will calmettes take up the offer? “of course! you cannot say no to a barkley entry,” he says."
"being an experienced runner, i was mistaken thinking that ultras would be more of the same. but making sure you prepare your head, body and your feet makes a world of difference the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. before this year, i was a reasonably proficient marathon runner (pb: 2hr 50min), but i had never run an ultra – a foot race longer than a marathon. intrigued by the ever-growing popularity of these races, i decided to ratchet up the distances. i ended up running six ultras in 2017, the last three of them in a mad five-week period, culminating with the epic100 miles sud de francein the pyrenees last month. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. it has been a steep learning curve, and by the end of these races i knew things about how to survive and complete an ultra that i didn’t know before – things that might help others embarking on one in the future. of course, not everyone will agree, and there are many ways to approach an ultra, but just turning up with a pair of running shoes, some water and a few gels, as i did for the first one, and like you can in most shorter races, is not advisable. ultras take planning. you need to be organised. that’s lesson one. it’s a lesson i learned the hard way, and many are the times i’ve stood alone in a stew on the trail cursing my poor preparation. one time was near the end of the second day of thering o’ fire ultrai ran in anglesey in september. the race is one complete lap of the welsh island on the coastal path. i can just follow the signs, i thought. but when i got there, the other runners were all clutching well-marked maps. others had phones with advanced trail finding apps downloaded. and all with good reason, because it turns out the coast path is not always easy to follow. the first day, a mere 35 miles, i got around by sticking like glue to other, more organised runners. but i realised this was not a foolproof system, so that first night i found a map and hastily drew the course for the remaining two days on it. i also installed theviewranger appon my phone and downloaded the gpx file of the course, which had been on the race website all along. but 62 miles into day two, as darkness was descending, i came to a crossroads. the sign for the coast path said turn left. my map said go straight on. i pulled out my phone. it was dead. did i trust my map or the sign? i went for the sign as, in my haste i’d been far from careful plotting the route, i now realised. i’d just drawn it on my map roughly, thinking that would be close enough."
"an hour later i was waving down cars, knocking on the doors of tiny cottages, scaring the life out of the local people, trying to find out where the hell i was. after more 12 hours running i was a mess. a mess of my own making. case study number two: coming out of py in the pyrenees, 11 hours into the 100 miles sud de france, as night fell, i pulled out mybrand new petzl myo head torch. a top-of-the-range beauty straight out of the box. the light it gave off, though, was a bit dim. maybe this was some clever lighting system that i hadn’t seen before. dim light so you could see other things? no, that didn’t make sense. then i realised – the batteries were dead. i couldn’t believe i hadn’t checked them before the start. i stood cursing myself once again. (luckily the organisers insist you bring spare batteries and a spare head torch, so i did just about manage to make it through the night.) every article on ultra running talks about this, and i’d read them all. i’d heard the quote countless times that an ultra is really just an eating competition with some running thrown in. but when you come from a road running background, it can be a hard message to fully take on board. so in themiwok 100km race in california– my second ultra – i spent 20 miles struggling, weary, barely able to get myself beyond walking pace. then at an aid station at 50 miles, some guy saw me trying to fill my pitiful thimble of a fold-up cup with a drink. “that’s not a cup,” he said. “this is a cup.” he thrust a cup the size of a pint glass in front of me and filled it to the brim with an energy drink. i drank the whole thing down. ten minutes later, i was running like a maniac, sprinting up hills, whooping as the other runners grimaced at this hyperactive imbecile in their midst. i felt so good i ran right passed the next aid station without even stopping. big mistake. lesson still not learnt. ten minutes later, i crashed again. so, eat, drink, run, eat, drink, run. that’s an ultra. for those races that make you bring your own cup, i now carry a huge, lightweight plastic vessel attached to the outside of my bag. and, at every aid station, i fill it to the brim. this may not be an issue for those with feet made of hardened leather, but for people with regular, soft, delicate feet like me, take note: you will need more cushioning for an ultra. this may be obvious, but i’m a steadfast believer in minimal running. i’ve spent a long time learning to run with good form and i long ago stopped heel striking. it means i can (usually) run in nice light racing flats. even in marathons i cruise around wearing shoes specifically designed only for 5ks and 10ks."
"so i thought i could do the same in my ultras. i couldn’t. in each race, i spent the last third or so with my feet on fire, trying to avoid any bit of hard ground, preferring whenever possible to run through long grass (slower) than on baked earth or tarmac (faster). this impacted on the rest of my body as i tried to change my form to protect my feet. i would finish each race in my minimal trail shoes glancing jealously at those people wearing those big fluffyhokas. “it’s like running on a bouncy castle,” one hoka runner told me.eventually i caved in and got a pair. and i have to say, they were a revelation. in the 100 miles sud de france, i was on my feet for almost 40 hours. that is a long time. my hip flexors ached, my quads were like bricks, by the end i was hallucinating ... but my feet? my feet were fine. this won’t be popular with everyone, and it has its drawbacks, but i found knowing that i still had 40 miles, or 50 miles, left, when i was already feeling dead on my feet, only stressed me out. then, after what seemed like forever of running, i would look at the watch again and i’d have 39 or 49 miles left. it killed me each time, like running into a hedge. so in the 100 miles sud de france, i didn’t start my gps. i just used the time, to get a rough idea of whether it was day or night. and mostly i felt more relaxed. i asked many top ultra runners for their advice before i set out on this journey, and almost all said to try to stay in the moment, to take it one step at a time. this is sensible advice, crucial even, but almost impossible with a constant bleeping reminder on your arm of how far you still have to go. without it, i just kept moving, legs turning, up and down, through whatever the race threw at me until i got to the finish. which, it turned out in france was more than 100 miles from the start, according to those whodidkeep their watches on. seeing your watch click past 100 miles and to realise the end is still nowhere in sight must be incredibly debilitating. but me, i ran on in blissful ignorance, churning away, like a monk mediating on the moment. well, sort of. so, now i’m an expert, which is lucky because i’m hoping to run the most competitive ultra in the world next year,the ultra-trail du mont blanc. i’ll need every advantage i can get to finish that in one piece, so if you have any tips of your own, please share them below."
"in the world of ultrarunning, he is a cult figure, winning his very first race in record time and charging towards the finish line while others jog. what’s his rush? zach miller is stirring porridge on top of a wood-burning stove. outside, snow lies on the ground surrounding his log cabin. we’re halfway uppikes peak, a 14,115ft mountain in the colorado rockies. the front door opens and a runner steps in, a man in his 50s, red-faced from the effort of getting up the mountain. through the door, the early morning sun flashes off the frozen forest. “i can’t believe you’re here,” the man says, beaming at miller. “you inspired me to run, man.” miller, 29, is something of a cult figure in the world of ultrarunning – long-distance races of any length beyond a marathon, often 100 miles or more. i first heard about him last year, when he was tearing away at the front of the world’s most competitive ultra race, the 105-mileutmbin france. he finished sixth, but for me, along with many others, the most memorable thing about the race was miller’s swashbuckling attempt to destroy the field from the start. the accepted wisdom is that it’s best to start off steady and conserve energy: if you go charging off like a startled horse, you’re usually in for trouble. but miller ran without fear, constantly pushing the pace, and buckling only at mile 92, when he finally surrendered the lead. later that year, miller popped up again ina video that went viral in the running world. it’s the last mile of another fiercely competitive race, the north face 50 (miles) near san francisco, and he is leading. he’s well clear of his rivals, but again he’s turning conventional wisdom on its head with his guts-out approach. in ultrarunning, competitors usually finish at a jog, enjoying the last section of the race, waving to friends, often embracing family before the finish line and crossing it with them. what’s the rush, after such a long race? but here is miller, well clear and heading for an impressive victory, still running as if his life is in danger, arms pumping and breathing hard. he keeps it up right to the line, before collapsing into the arms of his girlfriend. it’s this all-or-nothing approach that has made miller such a hero. “this guy has a god-given gift to connect with people,” the visitor says. “he’s so inspiring. my friends laugh at me, say i have a man crush. they don’t get it.” the man has time for only a quick selfie with his hero before he has to head back down the mountain. it’s six miles to the nearest road. it took me three hours walking briskly, leaving in the heat of a warm day down in the town of manitou springs and trekking up through dry scrub to forest and then snow. miller’s cabin is part ofbarr camp, an off-grid hikers’ refuge halfway up the mountain. it gets electricity from solar panels and filters water from a stream."
"along with his sister and her husband, miller is the caretaker: his jobs include cooking breakfast, chopping logs for the fire and mountain rescue. many hikers who stop by have no idea who he is, but often, his sister says, people come up all this way simply to catch a few moments with him. if he’s out for a run, they’ll sit and wait. “people think it’s lonely living up here,” miller says, “but i interact with people more than if i’m in town. people don’t just burst in through the door like that if you’re in your home.” miller has lived here for two years, coming off the mountain only for races, often in far-flung corners of the world. it’s perfect training country. for his core strength, miller likes to chop wood. “i spend a lot of time up here doing manual labour. i love it. the north face 50 race was at the end of the fall, and i’d spent all fall splitting wood and hauling it into the store. i was pretty strong.” when he’s not chopping wood or clearing snow, miller heads off into the mountains to run for hours at a time. he is a low-tech guy: he doesn’t have a coach or follow a training schedule, and his watch doesn’t have a built-in heart monitor or gps; it’s a $5 casio he bought in a market in portugal. he used to race without a watch, but he kept missing his meals: in ultrarunning, you need to eat at regular intervals, otherwise your energy stores can crash badly. he usually runs about 20 miles a day, sometimes 30. “i don’t really count,” he says, “but something like that.” in winter, when it gets dark early, he often runs at night in special snowshoes fixed to the bottom of his trainers. it may seem a hard existence, but the effort is something miller relishes. “i grew up in rural pennsylvania and loved helping my dad outside. i have this fascination with manual labour, just getting things done, seeing progress, whether it’s mowing the lawn or clearing snow.runningcan be like that.” pain is not something he shies away from. “i love digging in the pain cave,” he says. “i hate it, and i love it. and i think people identify with watching someone who’s really trying their best, someone who’s struggling, but is still trying to push as hard as they can.” once, when the camp was busy and he didn’t get his run in, he decided to run to the top of pikes peak at 2am. the summit is 4,000ft higher and usually a day’s hike from the cabin. he enjoyed it so much, he went up again the next night. and the next. “i ended up doing it seven nights in a row,” he says. “i don’t know why. i just felt like it.” sometimes, after running all day, he gets a call telling him someone is in trouble on the mountain and he has to head out again to find them."
"does he skip training when that happens? “no.” he grins. “i think of it as bonus training. when i first got the job as mountain rescue, i was like, ‘whoa, my running is actually useful!’” after breakfast, he invites me to join him on a gentle run. i’m an occasional mid-pack ultrarunner, so i’m nervous about keeping up, but he assures me he’s taking things easy this week, after stumbling on the trail and twisting his back. we set off heading downhill, off the snow and into the pine forests. he chats as we go and i trip along happily behind him, catching glimpses of the surrounding peaks through the trees. the farther we descend, however, the more worried i get. it’s going to be a long slog back up. sure enough, at the first minor incline, miller is gone. he waits for me at the top of the hill, but eventually, i have to cut him free. we’ve run a couple of miles. “you go on,” i say. “i’ll follow the trail straight back up from here.” keen to run at his usual pace, he doesn’t argue and, with a quick nod, he’s gone, scarpering off into the trees, leaving me to walk the last mile back to the camp. life up on pikes peak is a long way from miller’s early ultra training. after graduating from college, where he ran track and cross-country, he got a job working in the print shop of a cruise ship, thequeen mary 2. most runners would probably consider their training days over if they got a job like that, but miller made it work. “i could write the book on how to stay in shape on a cruise ship.” whenever the ship was docked, he would go out and run. “we’d go to chile, patagonia, and i’d just go and run in the mountains. wherever we were, i’d look around for the tallest thing or the coolest mountain, and try to run to the top and back before the ship left. sometimes, i had to run really fast to get back in time. if you miss the ship, you have to get yourself to the next port – then, when you get there, you may or may not have your job any more.” he never missed it. on sea days, the best place to run was up and down the crew stairwells. after an hour or so running up and down stairs, he’d go to the gym to run on the treadmill. “my co-workers thought i was half-crazy. they’d be in the bar, usually drunk, yelling at me to stop running.” it was during a break from the ship that he entered his first ultra race, a 50-mile run in maryland, thejfk 50.“my family thought i was crazy. my grandmother thought i was going to die or something. and i didn’t know what i was doing.” halfway through the race, he found himself running at the front with another guy. “i said, ‘my name’s zach."
"what’s your name?’ and he said, ‘rob.’ i said, ‘rob who?’ he said: ‘rob krar.’” at the time, krar was one of the biggest names in ultrarunning, having just won thewestern states 100, the biggest ultra race in the us. miller felt like an idiot. “i mean, i didn’t know much about ultrarunning, but i knew who rob krar was.” they ran together until mile 38, when miller started to pull ahead. “at the next aid station, when i arrived ahead of rob, everyone went crazy, pulling out their phones, trying to figure out who i was. but there wasn’t really anything to figure out. i had been a college runner, but i wasn’t that good. i mean, i ran 31:23 for 10k, which is pretty mediocre. so they asked my friend, ‘what’s his marathon pr [personal record]?’ and he told them i hadn’t run a marathon.” he won, running the third fastest time in the history of the oldest ultra race in the us. “it was pretty fast, considering i didn’t know what i was doing,” miller says. “that’s when i got signed by nike.” he was 24. “i’d always dreamed of being a pro-runner,” he adds, “and it happened – just not the way i expected it to.” for a long time, ultra and mountain running was on the far fringes of the sporting world, but recent years have seen a huge expansion in events, participation and people following the sport. as a result, faster and younger athletes are taking it up. “the course records tell the story,” miller says. “times people thought were untouchable are being broken by big chunks.” legendary ultrarunnerdean karnazes, who has been active for 25 years, says he has also noticed the difference: “the biggest change is the number of really fast, young guys.” the increased competition has led to a rise in sponsorship money. after three years with nike, miller has just signed a bigger contract with north face. “five years ago, if you told someone you were a trail runner with an agent, they’d have laughed at you,” he says. for the first time, he doesn’t need to work, apart from his running, but he loves barr camp so much, he plans to stay as caretaker for the foreseeable future. the evening after our run, pikes peak is hit by a huge snowstorm that leaves a fresh 4ft of snow over the mountain. miller is a bundle of excitement at breakfast the next morning, bristling to get out. “running is the closest we can get to flying,” he says. “someone else said that, but i like it. for a brief moment, you’re off the ground. and when you run as far as i do, you get lots of moments like that.” commenting on this piece? if you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please emailweekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."
"andy palmer of multiple-award-winning races organisers white star running answers your questions, from how to set up a race to how to divert errant bulls my name is andy palmer and i ownwhite star running. we organise trail events, from one-mile kids’ races up to marathons and beyond. these are some of the questions we are often asked. how do we plan a new race?a marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards. well, road marathons are that distance, as most are officially measured. but if you organise a trail race, things become a bit more flexible. that exact distance is very difficult to achieve if you are running over rights of way, national trails, hills, mountains paths, through streams, over stiles and around the beautiful british countryside. generally, the off-road world happily accepts that trail running isn’t an exact science, and trusts race organisers to be close enough. however, woe betide the race that comes upbelowthe 26.2-mile distance – people want over, not under. more miles for your entry fee is a good thing. we tend to use the term “ish” for our race: 26.2-miles-ish, half marathon-ish. it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card when the “marathon” is an extra mile or two. how do you decide where to start?the first, and the most mundane, thing we have to consider when route planning is, “have we got enough parking for all the runners?” that’s before we look at any routes. then we need a decent area for the start/finish, safe routes in and out of the area, access to water, shelter – and dozens of other things. all races need a good base camp. so once we have a base, we get the ordnance survey maps out and the fun really starts. we look for major roads that we need to avoid, safe routes to run and whether we need to cross private land. we ask ourselves, “would we want to run here?” dorset and wiltshire are smashing; it’s a good bet that it’s going to be scenic, and nice views are a really good selling point. once we have an idea of a race route and a good hq, we ask the all-important questions: “how far do we want to run?” “are we creating a marathon or ultra marathon?” “can we create a half or 10k or 10-mile race?” ‘can we set up aid stations easily?” “can the ambulances and medics get to people?” so, now we have the kernel of a race route. next we ask, “what time of year?” we hold a lot of races in the summer and it’s back to that mundane issue again: parking. finding hard standing in the countryside for 1,000 cars is difficult in january. we are lucky that the races we do hold in winter – atlarmer tree gardensin wiltshire andthe tank museum, in bovington, dorset – have access to dry parking. how do you measure the routes and mark them?with all that in place, we then need to get out and check the routes."
"we have walked and run our race routes many times, and have seen many parts of the country only a hardened rambler would see. we then measure them, mainly with gps watches and online mapping. we create a race plan with directional signage (a wooden stake in the ground and arrow pointing, hopefully, in the right direction). our trail races tend not to have mile markers, as they are hard to lay out; one person’s mile five is frequently someone else’s 5.3 or 4.8. we go on foot to lay out the signage – this can take days. the larmer races, for example, take two teams three days to signpost. how do you work out the logistics for each runner?we position aid stations approximately four miles apart. we use clean water containers and recyclable plastic cups instead of bottles, to cut down on waste. as a rule of thumb, we have three cups of water for each runner; on a hot day maybe more; our water containers hold 75 cups of water. for a race of 500 runners, we would need 10 20-litre water containers for every aid station. with five to seven aid stations, that’s a lot of water to move. during the giants head marathon last year we used 1,200 litres of water, 9kg jelly babies, 6kg of jelly beans, 1,500 gels, 100 litres of flat cola, 4 bottles of homemade blackberry vodka, 12 giant watermelons, four dozen oranges, 66 pints of our local brewery’s beer, 66 pints of dorset cider, 13 family-size packs of pretzels, nine giant packs of crisps, 63 packs of jaffa cakes and 600 portions of cake. what are the obstacles?it’s not easy running in the countryside. we work with the farming community and try to fit our races in with them. at a race this year, a concerned farmer rang me up at 6am: “morning andy. dave has escaped; we are dealing with it.” dave is a massive british white bull. a herd of cows had decided to escape from their field, and seeing them walk past his field, dave decided to join them by demolishing a barbed-wire fence. unfortunately, dave and his harem were now at mile 19 of our race, and the first runners were due to arrive at 10.30am. they managed to tempt dave out of the field at 10.15am. at the larmer races last year, a tree fell down on the race route. time for a quick plan b; we frantically re-routed before the farmer who owned the land called to tell us he had shifted the tree out of the way for us. so it was back on to the re-routed bit– back to plan a. we re-routed the ox half marathon and found a hill we called moah – the mother of all hills. moah is so steep that even the sheep walk around it. we made 400 runners go up it. they thanked us … sort of."
"when i wrote the race instructions for the bovington races, which takes place on tank-training ground, i had to tell the runners not to pick up anything that looked as if it could explode … and on the first year of the ox races, we had to re-route the ultra marathon the day before the race, as flooding had created puddles 100ft long and 4ft deep. we have to delay the start of the invader races every year because everyone want to take photos of themselves dressed as romans. trail running is great."
"during the ultra gobi in 2016, i felt more aware of my own body as it gradually disintegrated. according to scientists, this might be partly why i enjoyed it why would anyone want to run 400km across a desert? it’s a good question and one that i confronted last yearwhen i completed the ultra gobi, a single stage, self-navigated 250-mile footrace in china. this year i face an even harder question: why would anyone do it again? in moderation, running improves both your health and physique; in extremes, it does quite the opposite. the feet blister and swell to the point where multiple pairs of shoes in ascending sizes are required. toenails turn black and fall off or, worse, fill with fluid and require puncturing. some runners even choose to strike pre-emptively and have theirs surgically removed. stress fractures are customary. tendons rub and become enflamed, sending shooting pains up the leg with each agonising step. muscles seize up, cramp unpredictably and eventually wither away, leaving a gaunt and haggard appearance. clothing and pack straps rub the skin raw and bloody. the stomach often ceases to function, leading to vomiting or diarrhoea – a serious issue when one needs to drink 10 litres of water and eat upwards of 6,000 calories each day. but the greatest effect is less visible: the mind, addled by lack of sleep and constant battles with the body, begins to lose its grip on reality. hallucinations are common. emotions can oscillate from elation to anger to melancholy in rapid succession. speech becomes slurred; planning, rational decisions and accurate navigation almost impossible. it is not, by any conventional definition, pleasurable. so, why then, are increasingly numbers of people paying good money to put themselves through it? fortunately, this is a question that academics at the university of cardiff have sought to tackle. published in thejournal of consumer research,their research confronts the seeming conundrum that, on one hand, consumers spend billions of dollars every year to alleviate different kinds of pain, while, on the other, millions of individuals participate in extremely painful leisure pursuits. the paper’s title,selling pain to the saturated self, implies a key premise: that, unlike many sports and activities, where pain is a risk to which participants are prepared to subject themselves, in endurance sport pain is a core part of the appeal. even a brief conversation with most ultrarunners is enough to confirm this. races are reverentially described as “brutal” and “savage”, and suffering is discussed with gleeful awe. similarly, the marketing of many races highlights the opportunities for pain that they are, in effect, selling. although the research study technically focuses on assault-course racing (the lead researches using her body “as a tool for inquiry and knowledge creation”) rather than ultramarathons, the three leading motivations they uncover are equally transferable. firstly, pain makes us more aware of our own bodies – or, in the study’s terms, enables us “to rediscover our corporeality…through sensory intensification”."
"in a world where our bodies have largely ceased to be useful tools for survival and instead merely act as receptacles, it is perhaps little surprise that some form of disconnect has arisen. for the frustrated, sedentary office worker, sensory intensification – be it through self-inflicted pain or stimulatory drugs – presents an opportunity to bridge this dualistic divide. in the gobi desert in 2016 i certainly felt much more aware of my own body as it gradually disintegrated. it follows that the popularity of ultramarathons is closely linked to the comfort of modern life. try explaining to people whose lives are physically uncomfortable by necessity that you run in circles for pleasure, and you receive a blank look of confusion.chinameanwhile, with its exploding middle class, is witnessing and unprecedented growth in endurance running. secondly, there is a degree of mental escapism. as the authors, somewhat morosely, put it, “by flooding the consciousness with gnawing unpleasantness, pain provides a temporary relief from the burdens of self-awareness”. escaping from self-awareness would appear to be a common characteristic of the human condition. alcohol tends to be our society’s favoured fix, althoughbinge-eating, antidepressants and ultimately suicide are also associated problems. in this context, ultramarathons begin to look quite benign. it also helps to explain the abundance of recovered addicts and depressives in the sport, many of whom, asdiscussed by the famous american runner nikki kimball, use running as a form of therapy. and there are many others, myself included, who fear that without ultrarunning they might have been more susceptible to other, more damaging, forms of escapism. finally, the authors assess the role that painful experiences play in retrospect. pain helps people “craft the narrative of a fulfilled life through wounds and scars”. as a runner and occasional writer, that statement is as depressing as it is true. samuel johnson once said that “every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier”.ultrarunningcan provide ideal faux-battle wounds to remedy that feeling. some runners even motivate themselves during races by pretending to be fleeing the gestapo, or the burmese military, or another genocidal enemy. in reality, ultramarathons are lonely, arduous and largely uneventful. as a spectator sport they are marginally better than england football friendlies, but not quite as good as jenga. and yet, through social media and blogs, they are dramatised into heroic struggles and atheist pilgrimages, a transformation that is reinforced by the well-intentioned, if misguided, puritanical attitude that perseverance is, by its very nature, worthy. overall, the paper presents a somewhat bleak but probably quite accurate assessment. i’m left not entirely sure whether my return to the gobi is an attempt to escape the futility of existence or to find purpose through pain, to discover or forget, a therapy or a drug, self-harm or self-help … or all the above. i am, however, thoroughly looking forward to it. you can follow the progress of theultra gobi from 27 september hereand on instagram@jogonalfie"
"running round and round in circles for a full day and night? the things adharanand finn will do in the service of the running blog ... the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. many years ago, i worked as a writer for which? magazine, and often had to visit its testing laboratory in milton keynes. without giving away any secrets, they test things vigorously at which?. there were rooms for overheating microwave ovens until they exploded. there were sound labs peopled with experts sitting with their eyes closed. they had a bumpy treadmill-type thing for testing baby buggies to see how they performed over hundreds of miles. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. i thought of all this when i signed up, in a moment of madness, to theself transcendence 24-hour track race in tooting. i would be a human guinea pig, i thought, running around in circles for hundreds of laps, testing out running products to see if they could really stand the heat. this was which? magazine-level product testing.like the duracell bunny, i could be the ultimate kit tester, for a day. so, how did it go? i started out dressed head to ankle in inov8. rain was forecast, so i had on theinov8 stormshell jacket. over the first seven hours or so, we got frequent heavy showers, interspersed with bright sun. the jacket kept me completely dry, and was a joy to run in. it’s very lightweight and breathable, so i didn’t overheat in the slightest, and the hood was easy to pull up and down and comfortable to wear both ways. i actually enjoyed the rain spells, running with my hood up and peering out snug and dry, as though i was in my own portable tent. i had planned to change to different shorts and leggings during the race, but as the day/night/next day wore on, the thought of needlessly getting changed was too tiring to contemplate. this duracell bunny started running very low on juice after about 12 hours and so only the most vital kit was tested ... which in itself was part of the test, i guess. luckily, theinov8 shortsi started in were so comfortable that i didn’t feel any need to change them. they were lightweight and didn’t cause any problems of the chaffing variety. the only slight issue, if i’m being finicky, was the back pocket could have been a tiny bit bigger. my phone is quite small, but it was a squeeze to get it in. anyone hoping to carry around a bigger phone, such as the more recent iphones, may struggle. and why did i need my phone? for music. i don’t usually run to music, but i thought for a 24-hour race on the track, it might help pass the time. people had suggested it could get boring out there running in circles for 24 hours."
"in the event, it was many things, but it was never boring. after a few hours, every lap was a journey in itself, an epic challenge to be overcome, and music was mostly a distraction. i did have two periods of the race when i felt like listening to music, which was good, as i had brought along two wireless headphones to try out. theplantronics backbeat fitwere comfortable to wear, lightweight and have amazing sound quality. they promised six hours of playtime fully charged, which was plenty for my needs. however, i may be the world’s dumbest headphone user, because i found it difficult to turn them on. i seemed to have to press and hold down the on-button about five times before it worked. and occasionally the tracks would skip if i bumped my phone. later on in the night, i switched to thebose soundsport pulse. these had none of the skipping problems, and the sound quality was also excellent. rather than hook over your ear, though, these fit by burrowing in. i’ve never been a fan of this type of headphones as i always feel like they are about to fall out. however, despite my concerns and my movement (i’m not sure i could quite call it “running” by this stage), they stayed in place throughout. socks can make a big difference on a long run, so i can happily report back that the two pairs i tried, fromlululemonandinov8, were light, snug and comfortable throughout. they did a 12-hour shift each with no problems, no blisters, no rubbing, which i would say is highly commendable. of course, on a long run, the vital piece of kit is the shoes. i brought three pairs along with me with the plan to change them occasionally so my feet weren’t spending 24-hours running on the same surface in the same shape shoe. i started with my favourite running shoe of the moment,the brooks hyperion. i use these to train in and love the lightweight feel. they also seem to have a nice, soft touch on the ground, even when you are running on the road. some shoes seem to make a sharp slapping sound when you run, which always make me feel like i’m doing it wrong. but in these i feel light and smooth. of course, being racing flats, these aren’t really designed to be worn for more than a few hours, so i knew that, after a while, i would need to switch to something with a bit more cushioning. next up were thenike air zoom pegasus 34. these are a classic shoe and i felt as though i was stepping into a tried and tested product when i pulled them on, like when you get into an expensive car and everything feels comfortable and sleek. the shoes felt plush, and they looked good, too (i had the fetching pale blue edition). “almost good enough to eat,” one of my fellow runners commented as he went by, eyeing them admiringly."
"but these, too, are not designed to be run in for ever. i managed four hours before my feet were ready for the final pair. if any of the kit i tested was actually designed for such a race, it was thehoka clayton 2. i’ve always been a minimalist runner at heart, but i’ve done a few ultras recently, and i always end up with sore feet, looking jealously at those people bouncing along in hokas. so, i thought i would give them a try. as well as the ample cushioning – which six hours into the race, i was very happy with – they also had space for my swelling feet to expand into. i did get a pair half a size too big, which helped, but they are intentionally wide with a big toebox to allow your feet to expand on landing as they will naturally want to do. four hours later, i tried switching back to the other shoes for a bit, but i soon realised that, after 12 hours running, there was only one pair of shoes i could wear and that was the hokas. so they quickly came back on and stayed on until the end. at which point i collapsed in a heap on the ground, my batteries well and truly drained."
"135 miles, but with sleeps in between stages - how hard could it be? come share your tales of weekend runs, whether they were round mont blanc or round your local park in ultra running, ridiculous numbers are bandied about so much - 100 kilometers, 24 hours,3,100 miles- that it’s easy to get blasé and begin to think it’s all possible and reasonable and sane. if other people can do it, surely you can too, right? so when i signed up for thering o fire, a three-day race around the entire coastal path of anglesey, i saw it as a tough but manageable challenge. i mean,the utmb was on this weekend. that’s 104 miles, in the alps, in one go. this was just 135 miles around a reasonably flat island in wales, with sleeps in between. no problem. so i started the race on friday afternoon full of the joys of late summer, chasing runners around beautiful coves in isolated stretches of northern anglesey. the coast path follows the cliff tops, across beaches, around estuaries and along quiet roads past antique fish and chip shops. but by nightfall, as the 100 or so runners bedded down in a leisure centre gymnasium in amlwch, it was already starting to resemble a war scene, with the wounded being bandaged, guys writhing with cramps, the pungent smell of mud, sweat ... and fear. for in a few short hours, at 5am, we had to be up again ready to tackle the long day - all 66 miles of it. at 4:50am the gym strip lights buzzed on and quentin, the race director, walked through the rows of bodies, playing the race theme tune, jonny cash’s ring o fire. oh hell, even standing up was tough, with the aches and pains. setting out on such a long run with already battered legs suddenly didn’t seem so manageable - it seemed insane. without going into too much detail, lets just say that by the end of 15 difficult hours running, i got to the village hall at the finish in aberffraw that night in a dark place. i don’t know, even now, if i was hallucinating, but something around me was popping incessantly, as i crawled into a ball inside my sleeping bag and attempted to cry myself to sleep. it didn’t work - my legs, hips, feet, everything ached too much for sleep. and most of the other runners were still out there in the dark, scrabbling around looking for barely marked trails in the woods. and the biggest insanity of all? in a few short hours - again at 5am to the wakeup call of jonny cash - we had to haul these broken bodies out into the now driving rain, for another 51km run. so, what did you do this weekend?"
"this year’s ultra-trail du mont-blanc has the strongest line-up ever assembled for a trail ultramarathon – a visceral adventure of rawness and vulnerability i used to change the screensavers on my laptop and smartphone every month or so. but i have had the same picture on both for almost exactly a year now. it is the photo above of my kids meeting me in chamonix, france, in the final few metres of 2016’s 105-mileultra-trail du mont-blanc (utmb). after the birth of said children, and that time danny dyer put the phone down on me, it felt like the greatest moment of my life. i only placed 19th, yet the generous crowds treated me like i’d won the thing. the surge of euphoria was huge. the chronic soreness in my legs temporarily erased. my kids didn’t know or care how well i’d done, they just thought the whole thing hilarious. and soon went back to calling my pooh head. the utmb is the tour de france of trail, ultra and mountain running. there are tougher 100-mile races, and wilder, more technical courses. but this is the big one; the world’s most popular and prestigious trail race. around 2,300 people from over 90 countries – nearly 1,000 of whom won’t complete the circuit around mont blanc which nips into italy and switzerland. on top of the distance, the 10,300-metre of ascent – and more painfully, the descent – make it the equivalent of 10 snowdons (or 14 times via the popular but shorter pyg and minerss tracks). and never before in trail-ultramarathon running has there been a field as stacked as 2017’s utmb. a frenchman has won for the men’s race for the last five years, but the sport’s biggest star and three-time winner,spaniard kíllian jornet(remember that guy who ran up everest twice in a week? oh and then won the notorious hardrock hundred despite dislocating his shoulder at mile 13), is returning for the first time since 2011. frenchmen françois d’haene and xavier thévenard have both won utmb, twice, and both return. to see those three pitched against each other in a race known for its kamikaze-fast starts and, not coincidentally, high dnf rate amongst elites, is enthralling enough. but the race’s perennial subplot is that despite having many of the sport’s biggest stars, no us athlete has ever won the men’s race. if utmb was decided on strava uploads or self-flamed pre-race hype, american jim walmsley would win it. the only runner with a higher itra (international trailrunningassociation) ranking than jornet is highly talented. but 100-mile races require a unique skill set, and in his two to date he hasn’t shown he understands that. the deservedly popular zach miller – similarly fast and furious – returns, having lead the race for much of 2016 before fading (he’s also won utmb’s little sister race, the 63-mile ccc). simply to watch these two race each other has fans’ mouths watering."
"yet the americans who’ve raced utmb the smartest are david laney (3rd in 2015, 4th in 2016), tim tollefson (3rd in 2016; 2nd at ccc in 2015) and jason schlarb (4th in 2014), who all return. jeff browning, too, is a textbook 100-mile runner. other european favourites include lithuanian gediminas grinius (2nd in 2016), spain’s tòfol castanyer (2nd in 2014), miguel heras (2nd in 2013) and pau capell (several ultra-trail world tour wins) and norway’s diderik hermann. british hopes lie with france-based andy symonds, who won the lavaredo ultra trail in 2016 and has hardly raced this year to prepare fully for utmb after a dnf last year. other brits to keep an eye on are kim collison, casey morgan and danny kendall. but brits are disadvantaged. it’s tricky to train for the alps’ quad-hammering 1,000m ascents and descents in the uk. the heat, altitude and too much french cheese can also trouble les rosbif. jez bragg won a shortened version (due to severe weather) in 2010, but otherwise us-based ryan smith has posted the best british performance on the full course, placing eighth in 2015. however, in the women’s race, derbyshire-based doctor beth pascall is a podium contender. the debutante will duel with 2016 winner france’s caroline chaverot – who’s won just about every race she’s entered in the last 18 months – compatriot juliette blanchet (4th in 2016), switzerland’s andrea huser (2nd in 2016), spain’s núria picas (2nd in 2013 and 2015), brazil’s fernanda maciel (4th in 2010 and 2014) and america’s magdalena boulet (5th in 2016), stephanie howe violett (8th in 2015) and kaci lickteig. brits sophie grant (10th in 2016), anna-marie watson and sabrina verjee could all do well. despite a huge boom in popularity, trail-ultramarathon running is still a niche activity in britain. so it’s both exciting and frustrating to see what a huge sport it is just across the channel. the crowds at utmb give it a city marathon feel. cameras are everywhere. families gather by campfires halfway up mountains ringing cowbells long into the night. shouts of “bon courage!” echo around the valleys. in the two previous years, i’ve loved the crowds, the competition and the course, especially the night-time section; bright moonlight bouncing back off the huge white peaks, stars blending with the long zigzag of headaches, the whistle of invisible marmots. my personal fascination is to see how close i – aged 41 (but only five in running years) with two young children and working typical self-employed hours – can get to the professional, full-time runners with sub-2:20 marathons who train regularly in big mountains. i was thrilled to finish in 25 hours and 12 minutes last time, but some issues were holding me back and i think i can do a little better. even if it simply comes down to how much i’m willing to suffer. though i know i’ll be cursing the next sentence during the race, i love 100 milers."
"above all because, as legendary us runner ann trason said, running 100 miles is like living a whole year in one day. i love the visceral adventure, the rawness and vulnerability, the unusual amount of time spent in the present moment, the sense of feeling alive – even if alive can be pretty ouchy. equally, 100 milers have great potential to deposit you in a puddle of your own tears, vomit and smellier bodily fluids. either way, i’ll be thinking a lot about that finish line on 1-2 september. hopefully it’ll provide me with a new screensaver. the utmb starts at 5pm (gmt) on friday 1 september and can be followed live athttp://utmbmontblanc.com. inov-8 trailroc 285 my inov-8 trailtalons were superb last year, but i’m tempted this time to try the new trailrocs. as well as unrivalled grip on rock and stony terrain, they’re comfortable and deceptively well cushioned, while a gnarly plastic toe-bumper protects me in that ‘kicking rocks seems like a good idea’ phase of the race. inov-8 waterproofs & race vest inov8’s new superlightweight (an impressive 108g) ultrashell waterproof meets utmb’s strict kit-list rules, while the new inov-8 ultrapant waterproof trousers weight just 86g. we must carry leg cover and waterproof leg cover, so i take two pairs of these in my excellent, versatile inov-8 all-terrain pro vest. black diamond distance carbon z trekking poles ‘cheat sticks’ help your legs last longer. while there are lighter and stronger ones, these are the perfect compromise between the two. they’re quick and easy to get out and put away, don’t give my hands issues and wrist straps mean i can eat while using them. nutrition i love 33shake’s gels made from all-natural, mostly organic ingredients. clif’s caffeinated shot bloks keep me ticking over during the night. and when it’s harder to get vital calories in, mountain fuel powders go down well. petzl myo the myo isn’t petzl’s newest or brightest torch, but it’s a great compromise between lumens (280 – 370 in boost) and weight (168g), while the 26g e-lite is the perfect back-up (we have to carry two torches) follow damian ontwitter,instagram, or indeedstrava"
"looking for something social and visually stunning? the 100km race to the stones could be for you. after all, how hard could running with friends be? distance running is often looked at as a lonely pursuit, where the closest thing to conversation is the bleeping of a smartwatch. but it doesn’t have to be like this. having spent the early part of the year training for the milton keynes marathon, i was looking for something completely different; something social, relaxed and visually stunning – without a roundabout in sight. race to the stonesticked all these boxes. starting in the chilterns, the route heads west along the ridgeway, believed to be “britain’s oldest road”, before finishing at avebury stone circle, the largest megalithic stone circle in the world. runners can choose to complete the 100km distance in one heroic push, or in two 50km efforts, camping overnight at the halfway point in wantage. for reasons unclear, i went for the first option, convincing my friends nick and isaac to join me. we decided we would be “completing not competing”, an approach made necessary by our distinct lack of training. worryingly, my longest run in preparation for this hilly ultra-marathon was a half-pint half-marathon (13 miles, 13 half pints) around the pancake-flat streets of south london. at least we had the weather on our side. a mild, overcast day with some light drizzle – perfect conditions for ultrarunning. our tactic was simple: walk the uphills, run the flats and the downhills. we’d start slow and inevitably get slower, but hopefully not so slow as to miss our pre-booked bus in 14 hours’ time. the early part of the route is stunning, taking in the appropriately named field of dreams – a bright yellow crop field – and the not-at-all-grim grim’s ditch. moreover, unlike a road marathon, an ultra affords you time to strike up conversation with friends and strangers. after a quick game of marooned 5 – a twist on desert island discs, in which you name the five tracks you’d like to maroon on a desert island, never to hear again – we began talking with two israeli runners, one of whom had accidentally left his usual running shoes in his hotel. “that’s the thing about ultras,” he said, cheerfully. “they rarely go to plan.” stocking up with some hot food at the halfway mark, a quick calculation revealed we’d have to do the second 50km in under eight hours if we were to bus back to swindon station. easy, right? unfortunately, what with ultras rarely going to plan, isaac had managed to become separated from both his two water bottles and had become seriously dehydrated. an extended stop at the 70km aid station was required, while isaac rehydrated and nick and i attempted to eat our own body weight in bananas and watermelons. with the clock ticking, we arrived at the 80km mark to be met by a volunteer who cheerily told us there were “only four parkruns to go”."
"with two-and-a-half hours left before our bus departed, you might think such news was met with relief. however, with our current speed roughly that of an arthritic tortoise, it instead confirmed that we’d have to get a move on if we were to avoid being stuck overnight in avebury. yet, even in these testing moments, there’s the sense you’re in it together. perhaps it’s a result of the preposterously long distance, or the fact that pbs are of concern only to the very front of the field, but the atmosphere here was one of friendliness and support. even so, those final “four parkruns” were agony. in today’s hotly contested game of ‘my sorest part’, my right hamstring was now just edging it from my left shin, and the finish line couldn’t come quick enough. finally, thrillingly, avebury stone circle came into view. alas, race to the stones should really be rechristened ‘race beyond the stones’, as exhausted runners then have to about-turn and head another kilometre to the finish. rubbing one of the ancient boulders for strength, i shuffled onwards, crossing the finish line in a tad over 13 hours, with nick and isaac close behind. our preparation had been poor, our fitness questionable, but we’d done it. in doing so, a number of discoveries had been made. firstly, 100km is a long, long way to run. secondly, the ridgeway is one of britain’s best-looking paths. and finally, ultramarathons – far from being lonely pursuits – are great places to form and cement some long-distance friendships. register your interest for 2018s dixon carphone race to the stoneshere"
"ceri rees explains the history and terrain of the dragons back race – and what you need to tackle it the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. the dragons back is a 315k mountain run which has already attracted legendary status as the beast of all endurance events. unlike many events of this type, that reputation that is fully justified. it was first held in 1992, when martin stone and helen diamantedes completed the 16,000m of ascent from conwy castle to carreg cennen castle. only 15 pairs and six solo runners followed them across the line at the end of the five days. the race was revived in 2012. in 2015 only 65 people finished the race. this is strictly forseriousendurance athletes. or so i thought, until a series of group recces acquainted me with a handful of fellow ‘dragons’. we come from all walks of life and fit in training around family and work. there is one thing we all share however, which is the sense of awe we have for the challenge we have taken on. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. it can be a ruthlessly exposing event, challenging your self sufficiency and navigation skills to the max, quite apart from the physical endeavour. no assistance is allowed along the route or at the evening base camp and you can even be disqualified for sneaking a roll in to your bag from the catering van. i began my training with early morning 90 minute runs in the dead of a dartmoor winter. at the end of a 20 mile bog run, i questioned how i was going to double this distance, add on an extra 3,000m of ascent per day and repeat five times over. whenever work or family life has permitted it, our merry band has met up. since february, those of us lucky enough to live in the uk but not in close proximity to the welsh mountains, have been journeying up or down the m5 corridor to knock off chunks of each leg. gpx downloads, shoe changes, foot hygiene and cake have become regular topics of conversation on the official facebook page. my navigation and packing skills have improved considerably. perhaps the biggest scale on the spine of the dragon’s back is getting your head around the sheer volume of ascent and mileage every day. day one alone includes 3,800m of ascent. thankfully the organisers, ourea events, have left no stone unturned. their checkpoints, often placed on mountain summits by trig points or cairns, are intended to be logical waymarks rather than complicated puzzles. unlike the first participants, most of us will be wearing gps devices, strapped to our wrists like invisible shields."
"the early stages are defined by their technical difficulty and rocky descents, while day 3 to 5 involve vast horizons which stretch out in front of you as vast tussocky planes, making the several checkpoints on each stage quite possible to miss. overshoot one and you have to retrace your steps or get disqualified. no mercy will be shown by the race organisers. a challenge such as this involves bringing someone else along with you, whether you like it or not. our nearest and dearest have to suffer the weekends away on recces, and ‘another’ box of shoes arriving. kit, kit and more kit. for one of the cheapest sports around, there certainly seems to be a lot of it for this odyssey. these feet have already been through two pairs of shoes on successive recce weekends. we’ve all got our own dragons to slay. one friend is doing it to raise money for a cancer charity because his wife has second stage cancer. another recently split with his wife and doesn’t want to sit around moping. another was eliminated on day three in the 2015 event after missing the cut off. he has the lame excuse of having an artificial hip. i decided early on that i needed another form of motivation, so made the decision to raise money formind. i feel privileged to have an opportunity to share such a life enhancing journey, with super motivated and determined characters. whether we make it or not, collectively and as individuals, we are a tiny bit closer to becoming dragon slayers. good shoes:the most crucial of all the kit. i have chosen theinov-8 x-talons 212for their grip and responsiveness and will be inserting my own fleece insoles for extra comfort. while the inov8 terraclaw will provide a bit of extra cushioning for the tarmac stretches and trails in the latter half of the week. a running backpack:packs need to be durable, capable of storing enough food and water and other mandatory kit, which includes taped seemed over layers, the five day bespoke map, a compass and survival blanket. i’m using theultimate direction pb 3.0, which is lightweight and surprisingly roomy. a reliable gps watch with enough battery life to last multiple 10 to 14 hour days:a popular choice is thesuunto ambit(i use the peak) and thegarmin fenix, which both have excellent navigation features for following routes. an accurate altimeter and the ability to display checkpoints are essential features. a mastery of the software is also a pre requisite. several pairs of comfortable socks:since it is british terrain our feet will be dealing with, i’ve gone british and will be wearingsock mine’s very comfortable fell socks. a good blister kit:the organisers do bespoke supplies. poles:these are optional but black diamond (z pole) mountain kings are the ones i would choose. ceri is raising money for mind. you can follow his progress atberghausdragonsbackrace.comorwildrunning.co.uk"
"in his latest book, the ultramarathoner takes on the ancient greek 153-mile spartathlon. he talks about the magic in misery and why he has stopped stoking up on pizza hi dean. you have a new book out,the road to sparta. what is it about?it is the story and the lore of the marathon, from its genesis in ancient greece 2,500 years ago to the modernmarathon. it’s how the marathon became the marathon. and in the book you take on the spartathlon race [a 153-mile race from athens to sparta] in greece, right?well, what i learned in researching the marathon is that there’s more to the story than a lot of us thought, and it goes beyond 26.2 miles into an ultramarathon.pheidippideswas recruited to run from athens to sparta to recruit the spartans for battle. he was actually a professional runner, they were calledhemerodrome,which meant “day-long runner”. the athenians realised that an elite ultrarunner could outrun a horse; they could essentially dispatch men quicker than horses if needed. so the spartathlon is the modern-day version of that journey. as anultrarunnerwith greek heritage, you must feel a strong connection with this story?very much so. my dad used to always say that we’re from the same village as pheidippides. if you go to the village where my father’s from, everyone looks alike. you’ve run hundreds of ultramarathons in all seven continents – how did the experience of running in greece compare?it was a different sort of experience in that i’m a modern-day ultramarathoner. i have all the kit, i’m eating gel packs, hydration fluids and everything … but in this race i tried to recreate what pheidippides did 2,500 years ago, running in leather sandals, eating figs and olives and cured meat … i mean, they were a tougher breed back then. what i found when i was running for 24 hours eating only figs, let’s say i had some gi issues, my bowels kind of shut down, so i really couldn’t eat anything for the last half of the race … only water for 75 miles. i mean, he died at the end of his run, and i can see how it could kill you. there was a point when i was maybe 120 miles into the race, i was extremely dehydrated, my electrolytes were out of balance, and as i was running along i saw what appeared to be a grasshopper, or a praying mantis, a little stick figure in between my feet moving along as i was running. and i was looking down at this thing, trying to make sense of it, trying not to step on it … and then i realised, it dawned on me … that’s me! it was as though i was in a helicopter or a hot-air balloon. so i think i had an out-of-body experience. i’ve never had anything like that happen to me before and i thought, maybe this is how you feel right before you die. your books have inspired a lot of people to take up ultrarunning."
"is this a good thing?i’ve been conflicted about this a little bit. there’s a race called the western states 100 that’s in my first book,ultramarathon man, and there’s a lottery to get in. you used to have a 50-50 chance, but now there’s 15 applications for each entry, so it’s almost impossible to get in and people blame me, they say: “you told the world about ultramarathoning, and now everyone’s getting into it.” i respect that, but i think it’s something of a myopic point of view because ultrarunning is a noble pursuit and has brought purpose to many people’s lives, as it has mine. i wrote about this in my book and, in a way, that gave permission to other people to try these sorts of things. i think people can identify with my story because it’s every runner’s story, we all feel pain together. this latest book is about a very difficult race of mine. i could have had a good race and it would just be a standard race report, but this is about a guy falling apart, it’s a commonality that unites us. do you think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy putting yourself through this sort of pain?i think there’s magic in misery, and that’s been lost in western culture. we thought if we took all the pain and struggle out of our lives, we’d be happy, and i think we’re so comfortable, we’re miserable. when you’re struggling, when you look back at that experience, that’s when you feel most alive, and i think people seek that out because life is so mundane now. you’ve done so many races, can you say if one was the hardest of all?the badwaterultramarathon across death valleyis a very challenging race, 135 miles non-stop, over 50c, with a headwind. do you record your mileage? do you know how far you’ve run in total?not really, but for the back of the napkin calculation, probably about 100,000 miles. do you ever listen to music while you’re running?i listen to audiobooks. i probably have 500 on my playlist. i ran across america one time from la to new york and i probably listened to 50 books in 75 days of running. what’s the furthest you’ve ever run in one go?i once ran 350 miles in an 81-hour continuous push. what do you like to eat while you’re running?i’ll never live down the story in ultramarathon man of ordering a pizza and getting it delivered to the roadside as i ran by. but i don’t eat that sort of food any more. i really likenut butters, i find they sit better with me than gels. i likecoconut waterfor hydration, i find that works well. what’s your favourite place in the world to run?it was london today [we did a loop along the thames in central london before the interview]. my favourite place is wherever i am that day. but that was a glorious run."
"to you, it was all normal, but it would be like me taking you for a run across the golden gate bridge [near his home in san francisco]. do you ever run barefoot?on the beach, or the infield of a track, yes. i love running barefoot, but not on pavements. but i did run a marathon barefoot … i wanted to see what it was like. how was it?it was horrible! my legs were not as sore, amazingly, but my feet were really beat up. who is your running hero?probably my dad. i remember going to the inaugural la marathon [in 1986]. i was just a young boy and i remember he ended up in the medical tent at the finish. he was a mess, he had an iv in his arm, he was shivering, and i looked at him and my first thought was: why would anyone do this, i’m never going to run a marathon, this is the most ridiculous thing. so he influenced me, but not in the way you would think. but something about it must have resonated. the road to sparta is published by allen and unwin (£12.99). to buy for £11.04 go tobookshop.theguardian.comor call 0330 333 6846. free uk p&p over £10, online orders only. phone orders min p&p of £1.99."
"if you’re an ultra marathon runner, the standard 26.2-mile marathon must be a breeze, right? well, it depends i have run the london marathon twice before, and i have also stood on the embankment cheering runners along those last few miles before the finish. for most people taking part, this is a place – the last few miles of a marathon – they have rarely, if ever, visited. it’s etched across their faces in grimaces or manic grins. each step is a small mountain, the crowds are a blur ... everything is a blur. yet for a few runners, reaching 23 or 24 miles and pushing on is nothing special. for some, it’s not even that far. when i spoke to the famous ultra-runner scott jurek, before he ran the boston marathon last week,he was hardly nervous about the distance. “i don’t want to say it’s just like brushing my teeth,” he said. “but to run around in 3hr 30min ... i mean, i want to respect the distance, but it feels comfortable. almost like a warm-up.” ultra-runner karl meltzer wears a t-shirt that says “100 miles is not that far”. well,for him, it isn’t. he recentlybroke the record for the appalachian trailin the us, which is a mere 2,190 miles. after that, 100 miles may well seem short. twenty-six miles? pah, it’s barely worth getting changed. i bring all this up because having runa 34-mile ultra race a few months ago, i’m hoping to feel like i’m breezing along in this year in london, come mile 24. that’s how it works, right? of course, jurek’s answer contained a little caveat. “to run around in 3:30 …” he said. for one of the world’s best ultra-runners, that’s clearly not full speed ahead. but while running the marathon distance may not be a problem for an ultra-runner, running it fast is still a big challenge.ali young, a british international ultra-runner, says: “the london marathon is still a big race. for me, i find it the most intense training. it’s the only distance i have a coach for.” young says she will line up in greenwich on sunday looking for a fast time. “yes, if was doing a marathon just for fun, it would be an easy task, but i defy anyone to say when ‘racing the marathon’ that it was easy. just thinking about running 26.2 miles in sub-7 min/mile pace is hard. but that’s always my aim.” it is a perennial grievance of non-ultra runners that people are more impressed if you run themarathon de sablesor thesparthalonthan if you run a fast marathon or 10k, even though the commitment, talent and effort required for the latter can be just as demanding – if not more so. even to run one mile in a fast time is difficult in its own way – more people have climbed mount everest than run a mile in under four minutes. yet the fact remains, that there will be a select few runners on sunday who won’t be remotely intimidated by the distance. another is peter thompson."
"come sunday, he will be midway throughan epic challenge to run 44 marathons in 44 days– one in each country in europe (“i’m using the un definition of europe,” he says). thompson says that by running all these marathons he has, oddly, cured himself of his fixation with the marathon. he only started running in 2009 but he was soon obsessively training, running over 100 miles a week, and eventually, he ran a marathon in 2:25. this year, however, he says he will probably run london in “four or five hours”. “but,” he says, “it will be so much more rewarding.” rather than chasing fast times,he is now running for two mental health charities, a cause that is close to his heart. “my focus is very much on the charity,” he says. “i have had family and friends suffer mental health issues and i have dealt with it in my job, so i really just want to encourage people to talk about it.” this focus on using his running as a way of raising money, and also to travel and experience new things, has improved his relationship with running, he says. he sounds like a recovered addict when he says that, before, it took over his life, that he couldn’t relax in the morning unless he had had his run. “i still have friends who run and when they go to the pub all they talk about are splits, times, mileage. i’m really glad that’s not me any more.” so if you’re struggling along the embankment and a runner next to you is barely sweating, chatting and generally enjoying himself, it may be thompson, or some other ultra-runner out for an easy sunday jaunt around the capital. that is, unless they’re “racing” the marathon."
"despite hosting the race for 28 years, morocco still fails to attract female participants – but, this year, a global collective of ultra-runners hopes to change that on 9 april, for the first time ever, an international women’s team will take their places on the start line of morocco’smarathon des sables. the x-bionic women’s team, supported by the charityfree to run, will compete in the 250km run across the sahara desert in the hope of inspiring more moroccan women to take up running. “there aren’t enough female role models in this sport and by coming together as a team we hope to help change that,”saidjenny davis,team captain and driving force behind the project. davis will be joined in the desert by two highly talented moroccan runners, aziza raji and touda didi. all three are accomplished ultra-marathoners and have been training hard in the sahara for the six-day race. the marathon des sables, or mds, has long been established as one of the world’s most famous ultra-marathons. although it might not quite live up to its claim to be “the toughest footrace on earth” (there are other candidatesfor this controversial title), its size and popularity make it a special event, as i discovered when i joined a thousand or so othersshuffling across the desert in 2014. the mds’s popularity has not been limited to weekend warriors from the uk and france either, although they are by far the two largest participant nationalities. over the years, it has also become a major national sporting event in its home country of morocco. the famous moroccan brothers,lahcen and mohamad ahansal, have achieved national hero status after winning a staggering 15 victories between them. so far, however, mds has tended to be a heavily male-dominated event and has particularly struggled to attract participation from moroccan women. in 2016, 15% of the field was female and there were only three moroccan women out of a total 973 finishers. admittedly, ultra-marathon participation in general tends to be weighted towards men but in other races the divide is smaller and, in many cases, shrinking further all the time. the difference between the male and female winning times is also notable. whereas in many long distance and multi-day events one will find a gap of perhaps 10-20% between male and female times on average, for mds, the differential over the past five years has been more than 30%. there are numerous reasons for this, not least that the race requires runners to carry their kit – which is likely to be heavier in proportion to body weight for women. but the lack of “serious” female runners from morocco – runners who might be more used to the terrain – is another. davis and her team are hoping to change this. recognising that there are cultural and religious taboos surrounding women’s participation in sport, team x-bionic hope that their publicity can help to change attitudes and inspire a future generation of runners."
"aziza raji, who is aiming for a podium finish in the race, explained: “these opportunities are rare for women in morocco. i have noticed remarkable progress in recent years for women’s rights and equality here. having this women’s team bolsters that progress and i hope i can be considered a role model to other moroccan women who are considering getting involved in running.” the free to run charity, which “uses the power of sports to help women and girls overcome the harmful effects of conflict and discrimination”, has been helping to organise and promote the initiative. previous examples of their work include setting up sports groups in refugee camps in south sudan andhelping women to participate in afghanistan’s first marathon’. founder stephanie case is confident that team x-bionic can succeed. “having seen first hand the positive impact of our programs over the first two years of operation, i am even more convinced of the power of sports to change lives.” you can support the team, and their plans to expand the initiative to races in other countries, atjustgiving.com/fundraising/womensinternationalteamand you will be able to follow their progress in themarathon des sables from 9 april, or on twitter at@xbwomensteam"
"the ultramarathoner on running around outer mongolia and eating bananas and custard with his two-year-old daughter the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. hello! what crazy adventure have you been onrecently?at the end of january, i was running in outer mongolia,in the genghis khan marathon. at -32c, it was even colder than my native aberdeen. we had what may have been the world’s coldest burns supper out there. now i’m back working at the scottish running clinic (university of edinburgh), for the sportscotland institute of sport and golf’s european tour. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. what’s next?for 2017, i’ll be doing most of my running in the uk, which is great – i love the hills – and will also do the ryder cup run with a friend. we’ll start at the home of the european tour in england and jog over to pariswhere the next ryder cup is being played. we’ll play some golf each day also – some speedgolf, wild golf as well as the more conventional 18 holes. i love running and golf for different reasons – but both are great for health, so we’re keen to promote that. where’s your favourite place to run?the isle of skye in scotland.absolutely epic with the mountains all around youand plenty nice ridges to get up on to. even the bus/drive there is beautiful. although in the summer, the midgies are the size of golf balls. do you remember your first race as a school kid?i came third in my school cross-country race. it wasn’t really cross-country but a load of laps of the playground. that qualified me for the school team, but we arrived for the scottish championships a week late – our teacher had misread the information sheet. when people ask you for a training tip, what do you tell them?start slowly and build up. this will help avoid injury and get the race finisher’s medal you deserve. then enter a race you really want to do – i think a focus is really helpful and gets you out the door when it’s raining. eat decently and sleep at least seven hours. training is much easier if you’ve had a decent sleep. do you ever struggle with motivation?every runner will struggle with motivation at some point. with most races, i’ll try and break them into smaller chunks. getting to the next checkpoint is a lot less daunting than thinking of the whole race distance. i always leave my alarm clock on the other side of the room, so i have to get out of bed to shut it up. do you listen to music when you run?mostly not. most of the time i’m happy looking around or chatting to friends when i’m running. sometimes, if i’m training for something long and have to do a 50 miler along a canal or similar, i’ll put some music on to distract myself."
"although, the last time, i borrowed my brother’s ipod and he had all sorts of rubbish on there. do you like a running gadget?my shoes. currently, it’s usuallymerrell all-out crush.my feet are the tools of the trade so i need to look after them. i’m not really a man for gadgets. i think training hard (and smart), eating right and sleeping well are far more important than fancy watches and the like. the kenyans tend to do fine without them. i think we’re a bit over-reliant on them in the western world. i will usually take my phone to take some pictures if i’m up in the hills along with decent clothing, map and compass, etc. what’s the worst thing about running?having to clean rank socks and shoes from a day in the hills. terrible. what’s the best thing?seeing stuff. i’m convinced that you see and even smell and hear far more running than in a car or even cycling. it’s a great way of seeing things in the local area and further afield. also getting regular exercise keeps me happy. i’ve had a couple spells out with injuries and it’s no fun at all. what’s your post-race indulgence?i’ll tend to go all scientific and have some protein (to repair muscles) and carbohydrate (to replace the fuel i’ve used). this might be a chicken sandwich or a baked potato with tuna. but my indulgence is custard and bananas – both myself and my two-year-old daughter love custard and bananas! what do you eat before your big runs or a big race?it depends – for a race i’ll eat about 100g of carbs two hours prior – maybe a couple of bananas or a sandwich. i’ll have carbo-loaded the night before so just a small top up. if it’s a longer challenge of, say, 100 miles, i’ll eat something more substantial. have you ever run barefoot?i grew up in kenya, so used to run around barefoot to play football and the like. but actually as soon as kenyans run in competition, pretty much everyone wears shoes. lighter shoes offer performance advantage, but no shoes is harder to race with. when i came back to scotland aged eight, wearing shoes all the time didn’t come naturally, but was definitely needed for the snow. who would you choose to watch, mo or usain?there is something compelling about both of these legends.usain bolt for the theatre; mo farah for the utter determination and hard work he has put into being the best in his business. who is your favourite runner?kílian jornet is pretty exceptional – this guy thinks it’s normal to run up the matterhorn. he is the king of ultra-long distance running. kenenisa bekele is one guy thatmany of the really fast runners admire. his engine is so big, it’s scary to think what he would have done had he stayed fully fit throughout his career. but, if push comes to shove: my wife, jennie."

"ultrarunning legend jurek on his toughest race, his love of tempeh and why he’s running the boston marathon you’re a famed ultramarathoner. how come you’re running theboston marathon?i’m a lover of all distances and i love to jump into marathons. boston is such a special race, the energy, the people, the history [boston is the world’s oldest annual marathon]. i usually run guiding a blind runner or helping a friend. it’s my chance to give back. this time i’m running with my wife, jenny, and the founder ofclif bar, gary erickson. so this isn’t your first boston marathon?no, it’s my third. the first time i guided a blind runner, tom panek, the ceo of the charityguiding eyes. it was a special way to experience boston, seeing it for two people, not only thinking about myself, such as at the hydration stations, but helping someone else. it was an amazing experience. i guess as an ultramarathon runner, completing a marathon is just a short training run, right?well, i don’t want to say it’s just like brushing my teeth, but to run around in 3hr 30min ... i mean, i want to respect the distance, but it feels comfortable. almost like a warm-up. i take it you enjoy road races, not just trail races?all events have their own energy and experiences. in many ways i’d rather be running in the mountains, but i love to experience all aspects of running. i notice you haven’t run many competitive ultra races recently. are your ultrarunning days behind you?right now i’m not entering as many formal races. i’m more intrigued by exploring my limits. in 2015, i broke the record for the appalachian trail [a mere 2,189 miles] and i’m lining up something else for later this year. these adventure runs and trail records are what i find most alluring now, at the end of my career. the appalachian trail record [it took him 46 days, eight hours and seven minutes] was one of the hardest things i’ve ever done. you’re tapping into primal instincts of survival.runningin mountains and woods for that long, you have to be adaptable, almost animalistic. being uncomfortable like that brings us back to our roots of who we are as humans. you’re famously a vegan. when and why did you become one?in 1999. it wasn’t for performance benefits, but for long-term health. i was reading a lot about what makes a healthy body and i was working in hospitals, seeing what people were eating, and i just decided that that was the best option for me. i was eating a lot of junk food at the time, so i needed to do something radical. is veganism good for ultrarunning?being vegan keeps me on track. if i just tried to eat healthy food, but kept eating meat, i don’t think i’d be as focused. am i faster than another guy because of my diet? probably not, but it forced me to eat foods i had never eaten, or even heard of before."
"i was a meat and potatoes guy ... what sort of foods are we talking about?simple foods, such as brown rice – i hadn’t eaten that before. quinoa, lentils and beans, these are staples in many parts of the world. it’s not flashy, but by combining grains and legumes you have a perfect protein. then there’s tempeh, that’s one of my favourite foods. it’s like tofu but has a great nutty flavour, and it’s a dense protein. i’m a big fan of avocados, olive oil, coconut oil; they all form a big part of my diet. you don’t have to be vegan to eat all this stuff, of course. during a race, what do you eat?for a race like boston, carbs are the most important thing. for a marathon, i tend to stick to sports food – drinks, gels, bars. they’re quick and portable. i remember when gels were a new thing, but now there are all sorts of things, such asclif bloks, which are a chewy carbohydrate. and i’ve been working with clif to come up with what we callorganic energy food, which is like real food in a form easy to transport and use during a race. we have a sweet potato flavour, a pizza flavour, things like that. on longer races, people want something that is closer to real food. over the years, i did a lot of experimenting with what to eat while running, so i’m putting all that experience to good use. what do you think about that other popular dietary trend in ultrarunning, the paleo diet?it’s not a diet for long-term health. people can get results initially, because they’re cutting out sugar and processed foods, butstudies have shown that eating meat in those quantities is not good in the long-term. we’re not the same as we were in the paleolithic era, when people only lived to 30 or 35 years of age. carbs are not the enemy. even people who follow the paleo diet will use carbs on race day, because that’s what we need. the brain needs glucose to survive. you’ve done some pretty epic races over the years. which was your toughest?the 24-hour world championships. it was a one-mile loop that you ran around and around for 24 hours. that was the toughest, both mentally and physically. you’ve run the badwater [135 miles through death valley, in july,in temperatures of 54c] and hardrock 100 [which he won in 2007]. but this was the toughest?yes, without a doubt. ok, those other races look tougher on paper, in fact they’re two of the hardest races out there, but the 24-hour race was a different challenge. i call it the phd of running – no change in scenery, no running from a to b, no finish line. mentally, it’s a killer. trail running is mostly walking and running, but this is different. and i was pretty proud of the result – i broke the us record [running 165.7 miles]."
"where is your favourite place in the world to run?the himalayas is probably the most incredible place i’ve ever run. the scale of the mountains there is just mind-boggling. do you remember your first race?yes, i was a fourth grader in middle school and i somehow got picked to run a cross-country race for the school. i placed second. i didn’t really like running then, but the excitement and energy was pretty captivating. do you listen to music when you run?i do when i’m running on the roads, and if i go super-long, such as on the appalachian trail, then i do at times. but i also love to hear the sounds around me and tap into that, especially if i’m in the mountains. do you have a favourite gadget?well, a watch is pretty essential. i never thought i’d say this but on the appalachian trail, my iphone was invaluable, for taking pictures, getting in contact with people. i used a mapping app, too. i also love myultimate direction running vest. it has pockets, a hydration pack – it’s like a second skin at times. you featured a lot inchris mcdougall’s bestselling book born to run. did he convince you to take up barefoot running?the funny thing is i already did barefoot running in the infield and i was already using minimal shoes. this stuff was already around before the book, and i was always a fan of lighter shoes with less support. so, i’m a believer in barefoot and minimal running, yes, but as a tool for building foot strength and honing form. i wouldn’t run a race barefoot. it wouldn’t be efficient on rocky trails. finally, who is your running hero?yiannis kouroshas always been a hero of mine. when you look at the scope of his world records, it’s pretty incredible. in more conventional road and track running, i guess my heroes are probably steve prefontaine and emil zátopek."

"earlier this year, the 49-year-old made fell running history by becoming thefastest person to run a double bob graham round. what’s the secret of her success? the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. the 49-year-old breast cancer-survivor marked 10 years post-diagnosis by running thedouble bob graham round–132 miles and around 54,000ft of ascent – in a record-breaking time of 45 hours and 30 minutes. the guardian’s journalism is independent. we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.learn more. where is your favourite place to run?it’s got to be the peak district, where i live, even though it’s not hilly or very remote. actually, it’s very accessible – 20 minutes in a car and i’m there with my dogs and i don’t see a soul. there’s a place called rocking stones, which is a set of stones that look down the valley towardsladybower reservoirand, on a nice day, you can see for miles so you run with your dogs?yes. i was going to get a lurcher but, when i rang up, the lady said: “actually nicky, i know you are a long-distance runner; lurchers don’t like long distance! but i have got a collie cross that would suit you down to the ground.” so i did deliberately get a dog that could run a long way. did you run as a child?i lived in glossop on a farm, and i used to run around the farm to get the horses in or to go and see my friend on the neighbouring farm. so i was a good runner, but at glossop comprehensive we weren’t encouraged all that much. it was more team sports, such as netballl, which i didn’t get on with. hockey was ok. what’s your top training tip?get a pair of shoes. ok, so you need some other clothes to run in. clothes are good! but get a pair of shoes that fit you and are suitable for where you’d like to run. so if you are into road but thinking about off-road, get a pair with a bit of grip so that when you do get off the road you don’t fall on your arse. do you do much cross training?i didn’t used to, because with farming, it’s really all about upper-body training. but i’ve just been on a fell-running coaching course to teach people, and they were talking aboutplyometrics, so i’ve started doing some of that as well. i think it will make a big difference – core strength and so on. do you ever listen to the radio or music when you run?no. i like the silence of running in the outdoors or listening to the birds or the wind. well, i don’t like wind … but i don’t get why people like to run with music, it’s never been something i like to do. even when i’m driving in the car, i’ll often turn the radio off because it’s annoying me."
"what’s the best thing about running?being able to run whatever the weather, whatever the time of day. enjoying it for different reasons. i’ve just had flu, so i haven’t run for a week. when i went for a run again it felt like i was running on one half of a lung. but just the fact that i could run after missing it for a week – i was noticing different things. it was dark, i was going very, very slowly, just noticing that the moon was out, and the reflection on the road. what’s the worst thing about running?feeling frustrated when you can’t. that’s probably the thing that your partner will also say is the worst thing! a non-running runner is the worst person to live with. what is your post-run treat?fish and chips with curry sauce, and a pint of beer. or a curry. something spicy. um, silly question for you, but what’s the furthest you have ever run?well, 132 miles. but that was a run-walk! how did you fuel that?i had a big selection because i knew at some point i’d go off everything, which i did. so i went round in full circle. i started off with muesli bars, which are quite easy to eat. but then you run out of saliva after six hours or so. not totally, of course, but the bars feel very dry. so then it was rice pudding, fruit salads, baked beans. then, after about 18 hours, i struggled with that, so i went back to the muesli bars. you now have the record for the double bob graham round, and it seems that more and more women are winning ultra races outright. do you think there’s a point at which the gender balance becomes more equal?i think, off the roads, it’s probably about 20 miles. thinking about whatjasmin parishas done – in the lake district, when fell races are about 20 miles – she’s very near the men. i think she’s got a much more consistent pace. i think there will be more as well. what do you eat on the morning of a long run?porridge. with sultanas. sugary. some honey too. do you ever run barefoot?no. it’s something that i can see would work, but i don’t know if it’s for me. do you watch athletics?i coach juniors atpenniston footpath runnersand it’s an athletics club, so if athletics is on, i’m fascinated. athletics is so complicated – all of the long jump, the hurdling. it’s so many different things broken down that they’ve got to do. coaching juniors, i’m always trying to pick up the perfect form: what it is, how to get the juniors to do it. so watching, even looking at pictures on the wall here [we are talking inthe running works cafe], i’m wondering: “is that perfect form? triple extension?” for you, who is the greatest ever runner? [long think] i really admiresarah rowell. she was winning races outright, too. i think she’s a uk athletics selector now."
"so not only did she do a lot for running years ago, showing women what women could do, she’s also still in the sport working really hard now. she really pushed boundaries in women’s fell running. nicky spinks is supported by running brandinov-8, for whom 2017 is all about #getagrip"
"running legend ron hill has finally finished an unbroken streak that stretches over half a century this article includes content provided by facebook. we ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. to view this content,click 'allow and continue'. even the greatest streak must, eventually, end. andron hill has announced that, after 52 years and 39 days, he’s finally going to have a day off. for those not steeped in the history of distance running, hill, 78, is probably less a running legend than a brand name for somewell-priced kit(though he sold the brand named after him in the early 90s, and now runshillyclothing). yet he is undeniably one of the british all-time greats. in his heyday, he set world records at multiple distances (10 miles, 15 miles, 25km) and was the second man to break 2hrs 10min in the marathon (the first being australian derek clayton). he ran in three olympic games – tokyo in 1964, mexico city in 1968 and munich in 1972. he won the european championship marathon in 1969. in 1970, he won the boston marathon – the first british runner to do so – and in july of the same year, won the commonwealth games title in edinburgh. most athletes would see that as an illustrious career and retire for a slightly easier life – not just from competitive sport, but perhaps even from running itself. not hill. not for another 19,032 days. in a statement to streak runners international, hill explained: “it is with great sadness that i have to report the end of my streak. i have been having heart problems, and have been waiting for some time now to have the problem diagnosed and hopefully rectified. one-mile runs have not helped, and on saturday 28 january i ran my last one mile. after less than 400m, my heart started to hurt and over the last 800m the problem got worse and worse. i thought i might i die, but just made it to one mile in 16min and 34secs. there was no other option but to stop. i owed that to my wife family and friends plus myself.” streak runners internationalkeeps a tally of all ongoing streaks, from the “neophyte” (who haven’t even made five years yet) through to the hills – 50 years plus, in honour of ron himself. their official definition is a run of at least one mile every calendar day, and tracking streaks is largely a matter of trust – or indeed, honour. after that many years, the question of whether or not it’s entirely healthy, or if the body might need the odd day off, surely becomes moot. when he reached 50 years, hill told runner’s world that the most serious threat to his streak up to that point had been when he broke his sternum in a car accident in 1993. luckily, he had already run that day. here’s wishing ron hill a speedy recovery, even if when he starts again, he’ll be a mere neophyte."

"ultra-running is one of the fastest growing sports, usually taking place in remote, scenic landscapes. not a running track in london. will competitors reach nirvana? ‘ihallucinated, of course. i always do,” pat seabrook says. she is 76 and has spent the past 24 hours running round a 400m athletics track in tooting, south london. she sits in the front seat of her car, peeling plasters off her toes. “at some point i began to think the white lines on the track were ropes, rising up around me, and i was pushing them away.” she laughs: “usually i run with my friend and we take turns to hallucinate.” along with 44 other runners, seabrook has just competed in thesri chinmoy self-transcendence 24-hour track race. ultra-running, in which competitors take part in races longer than a marathon and often 100 miles or more, is one of the fastest growing sports in the world, with new races launching all the time; the biggest ones have been forced to introduce lottery systems to cope with the numbers who want to enter. but part of the appeal of these races is that they usually take place amid some of the world’s most remote and scenic landscapes, such as the sahara or the rockies. not around a track in tooting. the winner, james stewart, runs a mind-boggling 160 miles over the course of the day. it’s hard to grasp, watching him plug away, lap after lap: 160 miles, without going anywhere. he could have run all the way to cardiff, but he’s still here, on the track in tooting. seabrook is the oldest competitor here and covers 83 miles during the race. “it’s not that great,” she says, pulling off another plaster. “last year i ran 87.” as well as countless 24-hour races, she has also run 456 marathons. she didn’t even start running until her late 40s, when all her children had grown up and left home. “i needed something to keep me busy,” seabrook says. “what else am i going to do on a saturday?” yet in spite of her low-key attitude, something else is going on here. the race was started almost 30 years ago by followers of the late indian spiritual teacher sri chinmoy, who believed that running was integral to a spiritual life. in 1977, chinmoy started a marathon team, which began putting on races in new york and is now one of the biggest organisers of endurance events around the world. while most of the volunteers and organisers in tooting are followers of his teachings, only one of the runners, mahasatya janczak from poland, is part of the sri chinmoy team. he has done the race twice before. does he find self-transcendence through it? “at moments, definitely,” he replies, a glint in his eye. “it’s really something. you can only understand it if you try it.” diana celeiro has come all the way from argentina for the race. it’s her second time here. her husband, gustavo, acts as her support crew."
"most of the runners have someone who stands diligently by the track watching, offering encouragement, preparing snacks or helping with any issues that arise, from blisters to emotional breakdowns. some of the support crews have brought tents; one family even has a motorhome parked up on the edge of the track. a few of the runners have no crew and have just set up a table on the grass – or, in one runner’s case, an ironing board – laden with their supplies. some supporters disappear home or to a hotel during the night for some sleep. gustavo, though, stands vigilant throughout, always smiling. “this is different from running 100 miles in the mountains,” he says. “when you run 100 miles all around a track, it is a battle with your mind.” i ask how his wife is, after completing a race like this. “very quiet,” he says. “almost dead.” in japan, monks on mount hieirun 1,000 marathons in 1,000 daysin a effort to reach enlightenment. one of the monks once told me that the idea behind the constant movement is to exhaust the mind, the body, everything, until nothing is left and you are almost dead. “when you are nothing, then something – pop! – comes up to fill the space,” he said, miming a bubble popping. that something, he told me, is the vast consciousness that lies below the surface of our lives – a sense of oneness with the universe. none of the runners here in tooting vocalises it quite so lucidly, but there are glimpses of something deeper than pbs and course records. “sometimes, you can get into that space; a few laps go by and you don’t realise it,” paul corderoy says. “there’s a nowness to it, that’s for sure,” says jamie holmes, a management consultant who lives less than a mile from the track. he has recently completed the legendaryspartathalon ultra-marathonin greece, which is 153 miles. when i ask why he keeps doing such long races, he says he can’t really explain it, but thinks he’s trying to break himself. “i suppose i’m trying to find my limit,” he says. “maybe when i find it, i’ll stop.” shankara smith, the race director, says that the biggest challenge is yourself. “sri chinmoy used to say it’s not mind over matter, but heart over mind. if you can’t silence that mind, then you can’t do it, because your mind will tell you you can’t. here, you can’t tell yourself it’s you versus that mountain, because there is no mountain. it’s just you versus you.” smith has watched the race every year since it started in 1989, when her father was the race director. “i love it,” she says. “if you’re here at 3am, the city is quiet, nothing is going on, but on the track, the atmosphere is zinging. but also peaceful.” i spend a few hours watching the runners lap the track."
"everyone seems in good spirits; it’s a chilly, overcast afternoon, which is fine for the runners, and while a few have gone off fast at the front, most are running well within themselves, chatting to each other and joking with the officials. i decide to get some food and rest. driving back to the track at 3am, i find it hard to imagine they are all still going but, sure enough, out on the floodlit track 15 hours after they started, the runners are still going around and around. about 10 (mostly those who started at the front in the first few hours) have dropped out. some of those left look as if they’re in pain, their running styles twisted and contorted. many are walking, but even that looks difficult. one man with a shaven head is walking slowly with his fists clenched; he looks as if he wants to punch someone. they have nine hours left to go. some people stand out, calm and composed. one of them is 68-year-old ann bath. she’s not very fast, she’s a little bent over, but she is unrelenting. while others occasionally stop for a massage, or to eat something, she presses serenely on, never stopping. in the end, she runs an incredible 116 miles, an age-group world record. holmes, the management consultant, smiles when he sees me again. he is now walking gingerly and his knee is heavily strapped. “i think i’ve found my limit,” he says. at the end of every lap, the runners pass a tent full of people with big clipboards and lists of numbers. the lap counters have to wave to their runner each time to show they’ve registered the lap, and the runners usually wave back to double check their lap has been counted. as the hours progress, an intimacy builds up. they get to know each other well, and there’s lots of laughing and joking. the runners say it gives them a lift. “some races, you have a chip counter tied to your shoe,” one runner tells me, “but what i like about this race is that you have people doing it.” another runner and his counter are trying to name a new animal each lap. after a while, the runner, his brain frazzled, stops and leans on the table edge. “i can’t think of any more,” he says. “i’m done. no, wait, flamingo!” and, with that, he’s off again. “you’re looking great,” one of the lap counters shouts to holmes. “you’re looking beautiful,” he replies, his dazed smile now fixed permanently across his face, perhaps shielding the pain. when i catch him along the back straight, he tells me he misses his friends. “normally i run with friends,” he says. “without them here to tell me to stop being an idiot, i can’t find the will to try running again.” so he walks. but he doesn’t stop. around the track, many of the support crews are sleeping on chairs or on the floor."
"lauren howes, whose boyfriend, cameron humphries, is doing his first 24-hour race, is struggling to understand what she’s doing here. “i don’t get it,” she says. “it’s like a cult. his heroes are notbrad pittorgeorge clooney, but some ultra-runner guy.” “kilian jornet?” i venture. he’s just about the most famous ultra-runner i can think of; he runs up and down mountains. “yes, that’s it. he’s got four pairs of his shoes.” some of the crew are race veterans who can’t stay away. one tells me she was a marathon runner when someone at her club told her he had seen a race where people were eating sandwiches while they were running. “i didn’t believe it,” she says, “so i went to watch. i turned up in the morning and there was a group of people wandering around the track like zombies. i’ve been hooked ever since. if i’m not running, i’m crewing.” although at times it seemed that it would never come, finally, at just before midday, we get the bell marking the last five minutes of the race. for the final few laps, the runners are joined on the track by family and friends. fathers run holding hands with their children, couples run, or walk, arm in arm. one man decides to start sprinting, his support crew struggling to keep up, while another carries his young daughter. one woman, clearly in agony, is accompanied by her concerned husband and two teenage sons. when the hooter goes to signal the end, she bursts into tears. others collapse on the ground where they are, or hug the nearest person. i find myself close to tears. one runner, the shaven-headed man with the clenched fists – he didn’t unclench them the entire race – is walking back alone across the infield. i ask if he’s ok. he looks at me blankly for a moment, as though i’ve just appeared out of the ground. “i just need to lie down,” he says in the meekest voice i’ve ever heard. and so it ends. i guess they’ll all go back to their jobs and people will ask them if they’re mad. “why?” people will ask. “why would you do such a thing?” and they’ll probably be unable to answer. but they’ll be back next year to do it all over again."

"open only to serving soldiers, it has a dropout rate of more than 90%. in the tv version, contestants undergo enhanced interrogation, involving sleep and food deprivation, as well as ceaseless physical punishment administered by men with neck tattoos. what i have experienced so far is just a taste, and it doesn’t taste very nice. the fear begins weeks before, when i have nine injections, one of which contains live yellow fever virus. the nurse points to a map of the area of ecuador i’ll be flying to: it’s the deepest red imaginable – red meaning risk. aggressive daytime mosquitoes carryzika,chikungunyaanddengue, while malaria is a high risk at night. “you won’t have time to build immunity to rabies, so don’t get rabies,” she advises, not altogether helpfully. “because it’s fatal.” the immunisations are followed by a psych evaluation in which a mental-health professional advises me on the likely fallout of the trip. “you’ll be disoriented, possibly depressed. it will be harder for the people you live with,” he says, which is the closest thing to comfort he offers. i’m questioned about my mental health history, the stability of my relationships. i’m warned that being displaced and undergoing trauma may lead to mood swings lasting weeks or months. my interrogators might dig up sensitive information and use it to manipulate me. then there’s a physical exam in which i strap on a mask and power an exercise bike until my lungs burn. the doctor pronounces me of “below average” fitness. not so unfit i can cancel (the sick note i was looking for), but unhealthy enough that i leave convinced i am going to die. with admittedly circular logic, i am putting myself through this to understand why people put themselves through it. i know people want to be on tv, but why notcatchphraseordeal or no deal, where you might win some money? the appeal of hunted and eden i understand: they’re a chance to challenge the power of the surveillance state, to rewind the alienating complexity of globalisation. but why am i drawn to sas: who dares wins? i loathe machismo, scorn exercise, and would laugh if presented with anandy mcnabnovel, so what is it about lunkheads doing burpees until they’re sick that i find compelling? where did this cultural appetite for self-punishment come from? “we lead very regulated lives, where almost everything is done for us,” explainsdr rhonda cohen, a sport psychologist at middlesex university. “but knowing we can survive is a very important part of being human. we crave the feeling of being alive that comes with breaking routines and overcoming challenges. it’s extremely satisfying to use our bodies in new ways, and important developmentally. kids get that feeling of reward all the time, because they’re always learning new things. it’s harder as adults.” this urge to push our physical limits can be seen in the rise in popularity of what i call lunatic or non-fun runs. since 2011, there has been a 20% increase in people doing ultra marathons and extreme obstacle courses."
"there are plenty to choose from:thames path 100,spartan race,the spine race(268 miles along the pennines in winter). there areironman, double ironman, triple deca ironman triathlons.tough mudder, which involves only 12 miles of running, compensates by filling those miles with electric shocks, tear gas and rings of fire. as unimaginable feats become commonplace, elite competitors are seeking more extreme settings.the marathon des sablestakes place in 50-degree heat in the sahara, while the 135-milebadwatercourse runs from death valley, the lowest point in the contiguous united states, to mount whitney, the highest. meanwhile,spending on gym membership has risen by 44% in the uk in the last two years, and there has been a parallel increase in free,outdoor workoutssuch as park runs, wild swimming and cycling. we’ve changed the way we work out, too, moving from repetitive, machine-assisted exercises to more functional training. where once we jogged sedately for hours, now we run, jump, squat and lift, movements the natural world once demanded of us. increasing numbers of people want to train like soldiers, the most functionally fit people on the planet.british military fitnessruns 400 classes in 140 locations, and is adding more. “athletes aren’t robust, they snap easily,” saysdr sundeep chohan, a medic who has worked extensively with the special forces and is dismissive of gym‑fit instagram posers. “military fitness is a combination of 20 factors – things like peak flow and blood pressure. these are supremely adaptable and robust people. someone with a six‑pack won’t last long in the antarctic, where you need body fat to survive.” chohan is here with me in the jungle. so is jason fox, aka foxy, a former sas demolitions expert and the most approachable of the directing staff on who dares wins. (directing staff, or ds, is how the instructors are addressed; they prefer this to sadistic inquisitors or total bastards.) foxy puts another myth to bed, about the sas and masculinity: “macho guys who come to prove a point about their hardness usually quit first, having proven nothing,” he says. “a course like this strips you down to your base level, which a lot of people don’t want. they don’t want to know what their real character is. the people who get through need to explore themselves, or something that’s happened in their lives.” foxy joined the sas because he disliked bullies, craved autonomy and was “fed up with the pageantry and bollocks of the regular military”. he is a gentle individual, with a lisp. it’s hard to remember, as we bounce down a dirt track in a truck, that he is a trained killer with exceptional military capabilities. of the 350 men with whom he trained for sas selection, only 14 made the cut. the other instructors are equally surprising. there’s matthew “ollie” ollerton, who advises us on resisting interrogation. (humanise yourself; practise the controlled release of information; never answer questions with a simple yes or no, because this can be manipulated into a recorded confession.)"
"ollie is referred to by another instructor as the “short-haired hippy”, and at one point i spot a whiteboard on which he has written: “when ego is lost, universality exists.” jason and ollie runbreak-point, a company that teaches special forces techniques on corporate awaydays, which i would happily pay to watch. then there’s mark “billy” billingham, grizzled, blue-eyed and scary, the sort of man i imagine gordon ramsay fantasises about being. billy is a spotter: crossing a line of leafcutter ants, he explains that humans are the only animals clumsy enough to break it. “everything else will step over. if you see a broken column, there’s an enemy less than 18 to 20 minutes ahead of you – which is how long it takes the ants to reform.” billy teaches us that immersion in the jungle eventually makes your skin reek of urine, due to the production of ammonia, “but you start to blend into your surroundings. i can smell soap on a person half a kilometre away.” he tells us his training turned around an unpromising childhood on a west midlands council estate, where he was stabbed at the age of 11. “suddenly i’m learning serbo-croat, performing throat surgery in the field, advising prime ministers.” who dares wins features no weekly eviction; in the first series, there was no overall winner. contestants simply try to endure: evading capture, rescuing casualties, being subjected to surprise interrogations and mind games, supporting each other through pain. like billy, many are aiming to turn their lives around, or overcome traumatic experiences. one contestant in the new series signed up after his son was killed in afghanistan, having recently begun his own sas training. another, a young british muslim who has suffered racist attacks, wants to prove himself as a role model. reformed gamblers and ex-gang members rub shoulders with posh boys who want to be shorn of their privilege. it’s much more than vicarious thrills; whole life stories are being played out. even so, i have to admit something makes me uneasy about survival television. it’s a strange thing to do, passively watch other people absorb punishment. how much further can shows such as this go? are we headed forthe hunger games? the sas selection process was last year the subject of a judicial inquiry after three soldiers died on the same training march in 2013.the deaths were attributed to neglect, butanother death followed in july this year,on another sas march in the brecon beacons. tests that explore the limits of human endurance may be necessary for those who want to join an elite fighting unit; it’s less obvious that civilians need go anywhere near them. the ultra-fitness craze is supremely at odds with the comforts of the first world: what are we compensating for? i’m marching through the jungle with a bag over my head, blackout goggles strapped over the top. it is 35c, the humidity 95%. i stumble over branches and snag myself on thorns, to the irritation of my captors."
"every step feels irrationally as if i’m being walked over the edge of a cliff; and then they make me jog faster, totally blind. i’d like this to stop, i think. semi-delirious, i no longer feel like myself and my thoughts run away with me. maybe i should change my job. or move house. maybe i will run into a tree and be granted unconsciousness. the only way for a contestant voluntarily to withdraw is to remove their numbered armband and hold it in the air. due to an acute lack of bicep, my armband has long since slipped off my arm and been lost. the feeling is akin to being chained in a dungeon with no safe word. (probably.) soon, that’s almost exactly where i find myself, when i’m dragged to a cell and made to hold various stress positions. these are unnatural poses in which one’s bodyweight is balanced on single muscles or joints – holding a deep squat for long periods, for instance. even keeping my arms above my head proves agonising after 10 minutes. threats are whispered in spanish while my body convulses with pain. i’ve reached my limit. today i have hung from ropes surrounded by hornets, holding my entire bodyweight until my arms crumpled. i’ve scrambled up banks through thick vegetation. there are vines to support me when both legs fail, but they bring the palms up in stinging boils, prompting a tricky cost/benefit analysis. i have fallen down steep climbs, slid face first through enormous webs, and now i can’t take any more. at this point, i am interrogated by billy and another soldier, in scary mode, screaming questions in my face. i can remember neither the mission i am supposed to be on (something about reconnaissance on a drug plant), nor the cover story we invented. i know i have some names and coordinates on a square of notepaper tucked under my testicles, which i don’t want anyone to go looking for. even when the hood is lifted and i find i am kneeling at the edge of a shallow grave, i give nothing away. the two men seem impressed by my resilience. the reality is that my brain has checked out. yet i’ve been here only one day; the real competitors endure this quasi-torture for three sleepless days, spending 10 days in all pushed to their limits; when foxy, ollie and billy went through real sas selection, they did this for six months. reality tv can never replicate these former soldiers’ experiences. in the first season of who dares wins, foxy revealed he was discharged from the sas after suffering from ptsd. how does he feel about military training being mined for entertainment? “it’s education and exploration first,” he says, thoughtfully. “it’s about showing people that our humanity gets us through tough moments, not about being tough. we’re not invincible superheroes, and people can relate to that."
"it drives them to do better for themselves.” it’s hard to make the connection between physical achievement and emotional satisfaction if you haven’t experienced it; but, once you have, it’s hard to break. back in the uk, after my arms and legs and face have recovered, i find myself mentally reliving the few moments when i didn’t let myself down. scaling a tower of logs and throwing myself into deep brown water from the top. accurately recalling the location of our camp when questioned, out of breath and disoriented. spying the kidnappers early, gaining a time advantage and having the confidence to brave the bush. even if it was just for a minute, i freed myself. i am left with an entirely unexpected feeling: pride. a few months later, i am turning into one of the people i hate. someone who does exercise, and even worse, talks about it. i’ve started running, and swimming. i’ve started running around my local park. on holiday in france i circumnavigated a lake, clearing 8km without realising it, then 10km. i’m wondering about a half marathon. it helps clear negative thoughts, gives me a sense of self-reliance, a scale of achievements i can be in control of reaching. i finally understand the value of exercise, and all it took was a simulated kidnapping and some piranhas. given the choice, though, i’d still choose deal or no deal and a large cash prize. no contest sas: who dares wins begins on 17 october, channel 4, 9pm"
"during this race, our reporter will face temperatures ranging from -20c to 30c, wild dogs and 250 miles of inhospitable desert – and the clock never stops ticking aweek is a long time in running. or, to be more precise, a week is long time if you are planning to run pretty much continually throughout it. after a few rash decisions and some naive optimism, i am now in the gobi desert inchina, about to face this exciting, if somewhat daunting, prospect. theultra trail of the gobi(utg) describes itself as a 400km (250-mile) single-stage, self-navigated, self-supported race. loosely based on the journey of aseventh-century buddhist monk xuanzang(he took several years), the route passes some truly inhospitable terrain in gansu province. in his records, xuanzang describes it as a place that contains “nothing but barren sand and dry river beds”, where “when it is hot, the heat sears you like a flame; when it is cold, the wind cuts your flesh like a knife”. based on information from someone who has checked out the course, it doesn’t sound as if much has changed in the past 1,400 years. during this race, the 49 other competitors and i will have to battle with temperatures ranging from -20c to 30c, avoid underfed wild dogs and wolves and face a 3000-metre mountain thrown in for good measure. the cut-off time is 150 hours – and the clock runs continuously. the utg is part of a growing trend among runners to experiment with just how far they can physically go. twenty years ago, people might have been impressed with a marathon, but since then, distance inflation has been rampant. much as most long-distance runners hate to admit it, impressing others can’t be ignored as a motivation and, when aslightly overweight, middle-aged standup comedian ran 27 marathons in 27 days, they ceased to produce the requisite awe. it’s perhaps unsurprising therefore that ultramarathons (technically anything more than 26.2 miles) have been rising in popularity over the past decade. in the us, the number of runners completing races of more than 50km (31 miles) rose from roughly 11,000 in 2000, to more than 72,000 last year. in the uk, there has also been an explosion in the number of “ultras”, with many selling out at the speed of glastonbury tickets. with a growing middle class, china has also seen the races’ popularity rising fast in recent years; it seems life has to be quite comfortable before one voluntarily choses to make it uncomfortable. the utg is in its own league of “super ultra” races. to put the distance into perspective, the world’s most famous desert race,the marathon des sables, which i trudged my way through in 2014, is 250km and is broken into six stages over six days. add in the navigation, the extremes of temperature and the need to develop a “sleep strategy” and the gobi ultra becomes a logistically complex form of self-flagellation. signing up for the utg in june didn’t leave a great deal of time for training."
"the advice i received from others who had done similar events was simply to run as much as possible. with an 11km plod to and from work and a couple of long runs on the weekend, i was able to build up to 120-150km a week quite quickly but, between work and travelling, i struggled to go much beyond that. food, both the eating of it and the planning of it, was the other priority. while training, i discovered a new appreciation of all-you-can-eat restaurants. for the actual race, the rules require competitors to bring 25,000 calories, most of which can be placed in drop bags along the course. in the past i’ve found most energy bars too sweet and synthetic, but recently i’ve been fortunate to discoversome people in londonmaking sports food out of beetroot, goji berries and just about every other “superfood” you can imagine. my medical certification for the utg wasn’t without complications. in february, i visited a doctor in kathmandu for a routine checkup. much to my, and i think his, surprise, he found a large hole in my heart. one open-heart surgery, a week in hospital and three months of impatient recovery later, and i was back to running again, a little out of shape, but now with the advantage of a fully functional heart. joining me in the gobi will be an impressive bunch of experienced masochists. the international field includespavel paloncy, multiple winner of thebrutal spine race;harvey lewisandmarshall ulrich, both multiple winners of the famously gruelling135-mile badwater race in death valley; andjenny davis, professional ultra-runner and campaigner for women’s participation in sport. the chinese competitors, including some who have already run the course, are known to be formidable. if i’m able to keep up for more than a few hundred yards, i might even be able to find out more about them. signal and sanity permitting, i will be updating the guardian running blog with my progress across the gobi from 28 september. you can also follow my deterioration on instagram@jogonalfie"
"he started out strong from the pacific coast with the goal to run 3,000 miles in 45 days. but things took a bad turn when suspicions arose over his rate of progress walking stiffly down the shoulder of a busy road on the outskirts of indianapolis on a sweltering june afternoon, robert young moved into the shadow of a slow-moving rv to get some relief from the beating sun. thirty-four days into his journey from huntington beach, california, to new york city, the long-distance british runner was more than 2,000 miles from his starting point and still had 700 miles to go, in his attempt to break the record for the fastest run across the united states. about a mile down the road, a team of observers waited for young to pass, including 62-year-old gary “lazarus lake” cantrell and several other longtime, respected runners who dubbed themselves “the geezers”. but they weren’t there as fans, or to offer encouragement or moral support. they had a more dire intention: to determine whether or not the 33-year-old athlete was cheating. on 14 may, young set out from the pacific coast with the ambition to run 3,000 miles in 45 days. this goal would shave one day off the fastest transcontinental crossing ever achieved by a person on foot, which has stood since 1980 despite numerous attempts. growing up in a small village in yorkshire, young was subjected to years of abuse at the hands of his father. as hedescribed in an interviewearlier this year, much of his ambition stems from a drive to overcome his harrowing past. according to his autobiography, young considers himself to be an ordinary runner with an extraordinary ability to endure pain. young is relatively new to the sport, but his compelling backstory has gained a wide following. he ran his first marathon on a dare in 2014, then proceeded to run 370 moreover the course of a year. the feat is documented in his popular autobiography, marathon man, and his fans regard him as something of an endurance savant. but however fit and talented young might be, there’s a reason the transcontinental record hasn’t been broken for 36 years. three thousand miles in 45 days breaks down to 67 miles a day – that’s two and a half marathons every day, for a month and a half. even for young, that’s a stretch. and yet, according toposts on young’s blogdocumenting his progress, the first weeks of young’s run were dominated by 70-mile and 80-mile days. photos of young looking relaxed and confident accompanied his updates, which raised suspicions in a mailing list for professional runners, ultra list. “[his] tracker and gps data are cans of worms,” robert lopez wrote to ultra list subscribers. “there is a day that rob’s rv got stuck in the desert. the location is known. [...] whether he legged out the 40-plus road miles or somehow orienteered his way through the brush without navigational aids, [his] time is incredible. and i mean that in the literal sense.” young made running across america look easy."
"too easy, many skeptics argued on letsrun.com. among the criticisms were detailed analyses of young’s claims, including speeds that had never been achieved before. “as he was claiming really big mileage, the doubts grew,” said wouter hamelinck, a belgian ultrarunner. “either he was exaggerating or he was throwing in world-class performances. for me, the most damning part is that his run totally changed after he knew that he was in the spotlight.” indeed, after murmurs of young cheating spread within the community, his speed began to decline. young’s last 70-miler happened on 7 june, when he clocked 71 miles running through the missouri heartland, the same day a kansas runner named asher delmott posted accusations of cheating onletsrun.com. delmottwrotethat he went to meet young, only to find his rv driving slowly down the road with no runner in sight. he then tracked down surveillance cameras of the rv doing the same thing in different locations along his route. “after it drove by, i ran into the highway, turned on my headlamp to strobe mode, and started running behind the rv,” he wrote. “it was driving running speed, so i was making progress, but they saw my light and stopped.” delmott suggested that young was occasionally riding in the rv when he claimed to be running. rumors began to spread even more. young’s team fervently denied the speculations on theirfacebook page, and posted videos explaining why the incidents were a misunderstanding. however, theydeclinedto release gps data until after the run had finished. this emboldened critics, who took their claims to popular running media such as runner’s world,outside magazineandsports illustrated. as cheating speculation spread, young’s team reported compounding physical and mental strain. his daily mileage plummeted. he clocked 44 miles on 9 june and 40 miles on 10 june. meanwhile, “the geezers” were becoming aware of young’s story. spurred on by encouragement from the community, cantrell rallied a group of longtime runners and launched a crowd-funding campaign to cover expenses. their intent: to shadow young’s every move for the remainder of the run, observe his progress, and document what they saw. their observations wouldn’t prove or disprove the allegations, but they would provide credibility – or lack thereof – to young’s effort. “i was an accountant for 35 years and look at this as an auditing job,” cantrell said. “[young’s team] welcomed us when we got here. they want an independent record.” on 11 june, cantrell’s “team geezer” watched young battle to finish a meager 41-mile day in illinois. cantrell said he believed young had already entered “the death spiral”. for five days in early june, cantrell and the geezers drove behind young’s support team rv through indiana and illinois, and parked at various pullouts alongside the road, observing young as he passed by. weeks into his journey, young was struggling to run 40 miles a day – a far cry from what he’d accomplished at the beginning of his journey."
"cantrell, a guru-like figure with a long gray beard, watched sympathetically as young strained through every mile, frequently hobbling at a slow walking pace. on 15 june, cantrell watched as young fell face-down ont o a road just outside of indianapolis, cutting his forehead. when his crew reached him, young’s face was covered in blood and he was asleep. “but he did get up, every time,” cantrell said. “at times his pace slowed to a mile an hour. to be perfectly honest, if he were an entrant in a race i directed, i would have pulled the plug. but whatever the outcome … it is a shame that no one may ever appreciate the sheer determination that it took to get 40 miles today.” cantrell said he respected young’s grit and sheer stubbornness, as well as his remarkable ability to recover after appearing utterly broken. but in five days of following young’s every move, cantrell didn’t witness any indication that he was capable of achieving the mileages he claimed in the first days of his transcontinental run. young was good, but not great, cantrell said. despite his injuries and his tenacity, the question of whether or not young had cheated early on in his journey remained. the discrepancies in his pace – from 70 miles a day to less than 40 – were just too big to believe that young had ever been able to run at such high speeds in the first place. “there remain serious questions about the first part of the run. i hope they do have the data that will present a believable explanation for all of the discrepancies.” cantrell said. still, in the days cantrell spent with young, he grew fond of him. he offered the struggling runner advice and gear, including one of his own cotton dress shirts, which he explained would help keep young cooler in the heat. he also instructed young to cut holes in his shoes to relieve pressure from his swollen feet. on 16 june – 34 days into his run – young donned cantrell’s shirt, shoes and hole-riddled socks, then proceeded to gut out 61 miles. cantrell marveled at this late comeback after five days of running only 40 miles or so. sixty-mile days are what young needed to stay on record pace. “i was doing the math to see when it would be over,” cantrell said. “but robert young was not over. he came out and walked for a while. then he started to run and run and run.” later that evening, young checked into an emergency room in indianapolis, where he was diagnosed with a fracture in the fifth toe on his right foot, as well as cellulitis – a painful and potentially serious bacterial skin infection. his team vowed to “battle on”. and then they went silent. the blog and social media accounts went quiet and his online tracker stopped moving. cantrell said team geezer abandoned the watch."
"“i am done because i do not want to be a party to putting robert young in the hospital,” cantrell wrote in an email. “this much i will say. it seems to be a consistent part of this pattern, to make claims that an individual is somehow physiologically different from everyone else. they are not. “what i saw was the same thing i have seen from multi-day runners for decades. the bright-eyed, chipper runner that i first saw last sunday was reduced to a shambling, hollow-eyed shell.” young waited until 20 june to officially announce the end of his record attempt “for medical reasons”. he continued to deny accusations of cheating. “in order to clear up this matter, in the next few days all data from the trip, which should exonerate me from any suggestion of wrongdoing, will be made available for examination by all concerned parties,” he wrote. young insisted he would provide data from his gps watches – as well as reasonable explanations for the suspicious surveillance videos. several of young’s most fervent critics said that if his watch data checks out, they will concede their suspicions that he cheated. but cantrell, remains a skeptic. as a self-proclaimed “old-timer”, he tends to credit officially recorded race performances over what he views as dubious technologies. but cantrell knows his questions might be falling on closed ears. young’s fans are eager to see him pull through. “the overwhelming social media response has been adulation and accolades, with the few dissenting voices effectively drowned out. he does not need credibility with the ultrarunning community. they are not the target market.”"
"the holder of the south west coast path fastest known time talks custard, crying and falling asleep on his feet at 8.19pm on tuesday 24 may damian hall reached minehead and the end of britain’s longest national trail, the south west coast path (swcp). in doing so, he set a new fastest known time (fkt) for the 630-mile footpath of 10 days, 15 hours and 18 minutes, knocking more than 16 hours off the previous record. he averaged 60 miles per day. hi damian, have you recovered yet?my feet are a lot less grumpy. i’m no longer waking in the middle of the night in a sweat. and i can no longer eat three breakfasts without subsequent pressure being applied to my belt. so, hopefully, i’m partly recovered. i haven’t tried running yet. talking of which, what made you think running 630 miles would be a good idea?i’m not sure i ever did. it was my good friend mark townsend’s idea, and he’s a persuasive fellow. he co-owns contours walking holidays and wanted to run the swcp to help promote his company’s new arm,contours trail running holidays. more than that, though, he used to have the fkt and he wanted it back. so two of your started, but only one finished?mark had a knee problem from an accident a few weeks before our attempt, but he’s a heroically stubborn bugger – he once refused to drop out of the ultra-trail du mont-blanc after a mid-race stroke. he did the first 300 miles of the swcp with me, but was in increasing discomfort and we slipped behind the then fkt. he had to stop, but really didn’t want to – the fkt meant a lot to him. but it made me all the more determined to set a new record on his behalf. from then on he became the tactical mastermind and his wimp-management skills came to the fore. how so?i never thought of giving up. but i could get a bit despondent. i usually started running at 5am and because the terrain is so hilly – there’s around 111,000ft of ascent, more than three times up everest – it took time to log the miles. four miles an hour was the fastest i managed, and i rarely reached that. by about midnight i’d be inclined towards a lie down, especially if there was a bit of a storm on the go and the path went along remote clifftops. sometimes mark had to calmly explain that it wasn’t bedtime quite yet if i wanted to set a record. where did you sleep and eat?we had a vw transporter kombi, which was superb, and a good friend, tom jones, crewed for us. this meant feeding us at all hours, driving down ridiculously narrow and steep lanes, putting up with how ungrateful, grumpy and foul-smelling i was, running out to meet me in the middle of the night in apocalyptic storms and probably a thousand other things i don’t even know about. that man is a marvel. and he makes a mean “custard surprise”."
"he still won’t tell me what was in it. how did your body cope with 630 miles?i got plenty of niggles – in fact, every previous injury i’ve had returned as if it had never been away – but it was amazing how my body just seemed to deal with them, strengthen and overcome them. i remember on day eight realising that my legs felt fantastic, really good – a tribute to my coach, ian sharman. my feet got a bit fed up and blistery towards the end, but feet can be a bit self-important like that. what was the lowest point?the days when mark was struggling were horrible because i could see how much he wanted to continue. i guess as i got more and more tired – i was averaging three hours’ sleep a night, then two for the last two nights – it was harder to remember to enjoy it. i allowed myself to feel oppressed by the task and it felt relentless sometimes: yes, you’ve done 60 miles, but there are still 200 to go. i fell asleep on my feet at one point. i also cried a bit, often just a five-second burst. i think that was just sheer tiredness, missing my kids and guilt about being away from them. but i felt amazing again after a quick weep. i recommend a swift daily sob to everyone. and the highlight?the scenery was very special. so many handsome bays, coves, beaches and rugged cliffs. i saw deer, seals, hedgehogs, badgers, foxes chasing rabbits. but also people were so supportive when they realised what i was doing. i was often given cash towards my fundraising or free meals, free ferry rides, bags of sweets. people are great. yay for people! why try to set a record?it’s hard not to answer in cliches, but it’s a wonderful adventure, in a very special part of the world, where you learn things about yourself. i can often go through a week mostly on autopilot, only half alive. when you do something like this, you spend most of the time right there in the moment – above all because you have to watch where you’re putting your feet – and that mindfulness has to be good for you. and you go through so many emotions. you’re alive. you can be quite sleepy, but you’re definitely alive. how did you get into ultra-distance running?i did my first marathon in 2012. i loved it and hated it and wondered, what next? luckily, outdoor fitness magazine sent me to run an ultramarathon and i fell head over heels in love with the concept. the scenery, the camaraderie, the sense of achievement, all that compression-wear and cake. no wonder their popularity is booming. they’re far easier than most people seem to think. and trail running is so much better for you than road running, physically and mentally. so what’s next?the ultra-trail du mont-blanc is the big one for me, in chamonix in august. but i’m already scheming and dreaming about more fkts."

"the new bob graham round record-holding fellrunner on prosecco and pizza, and feeling like she could run for ever on 23 april, fellrunner jasmin paris broke the women’s record for completing the legendarybob graham round, a 66-mile circuit scaling 42 of the highest peaks in the lake district. her time of 15 hours and 24 minutes was more than two-and-a-half hours faster than the previous record set by nicky spinks in 2015. hi jasmin, have you recovered yet?yes. i feel pretty good, actually. how long did it take you to get over such an epic feat of endurance?well, i did the round on saturday, and i was back running on tuesday, a few days later. didn’t you want to take some time off to rest?not really. i love running, that’s why i do it. i live near edinburgh, right by the hills, so i just felt like going for a run. was this your first attempt at the bob graham round?no, i had run it before. normally, i like to run without any support, no fuss, so i first did it as a winter round with my fiance, konrad. we did it in 22 hours 28 minutes carrying our own stuff - the only support was my mum at some of the road crossings. but once i’d done it following the purist approach, i then decided i wanted to try to do it fast. did you think you could break the record? was that the plan?i thought i could break it, but not by that much. nicky spinks had the record and i generally finish ahead of her when we race, so that gave me the belief that i could break the record. a few weeks after you broke her record,spinks ran a double bob graham round[completing the circuit twice in a record 45 hours 30 minutes]. how did you feel about that? did she steal your thunder slightly?no! i was there supporting her. i felt bad, actually, for breaking her record, so i was glad she got the record for the double round. that’s not one i’ll be chasing. how did you get into fellrunning?i didn’t start running until after university. i’d always walked a lot in the hills, so i guess it was a natural progression to start running in them. once i had a busy job, i realised i could get out into the hills in less time if i ran. also, a colleague suggested i run a fell race. i just had normal running shoes on and it was quite slippy, so i spent most of the time on my bum. but i loved it. what’s next for you?i’ll be doing some sky races in europe: the skyrunning world championships at thebuff epic trailin spain, then theutmb[ultra-trail du mont-blanc]. i’d also like to try thepaddy buckley round[in wales] and theramsay round[in scotland] at some point in the future. are you getting invited to more races since the bob graham round record? have things changed?a bit, though i was getting invitations already."
"but i’m not one to chase the limelight, so things haven’t really changed. people keep talking up my chances at the utmb, though, but it’s further than i’m used to, so we’ll see. what’s your favourite place to run?that’s quite hard. i’m tempted to say the lake district, but i don’t know. what was your first ever race and how did it go?it was that race my colleague got me to run, a local fell race in glossop [in the peak district]. it was a revelation to me that there were people running around in the hills like this. i loved it. what advice would you give to anyone attempting the bob graham round?it’s good to know the route well. i ran around the route twice, in winter and then again in march. even if you have a support team that knows the route, it helps you mentally if you know what you’ve got coming. another big thing is not to do it in bad weather. people get everything set up and if the weather is bad they just try it anyway. but bad weather can foil your attempt. i’d say schedule it for two weekends in a row in case the first one is bad weather. do you ever struggle with motivation?no. i struggle with having enough time, but not motivation. maybe if i ran on roads i would, but i rarely run on roads. only to get to the hills. do you listen to music when you run?no. only in the gym on a treadmill – which is something i only do under extreme necessity. what is your favourite running gadget?er, my compass? i don’t really use gadgets. i have a gps watch, but i rarely wear it. this may be difficult for you, but what’s the worst thing about running?the muddy shoes i have to clean. and the best thing?mostly the places i get to run in; that’s amazing. then behind that is the feeling of being fit, the feeling that you could run for ever. what’s your post-race indulgence?when i’m racing, most sundays, after the race, we have prosecco, pizza and ice-cream. that’s our recovery meal! and what do you have for breakfast before a race?porridge, with raisins and flaked almonds. have you ever tried barefoot running?yes. i used to walk around barefoot a lot as a kid. then, a few years ago, when i had achilles tendinitis, i found it was better running without shoes. so, until it cleared up, i ran in the hills mostly barefoot. finally, who is your running hero?i’d have to sayjoss naylor, in a sense. he was still working as a sheep farmer, then he would go and run, say, the pennine way in some crazy time, and then come back and carry on working on the farm."
"track session, parkrun, long run or just breaking a world record on a treadmill? as always, come and share your weekend exploits (even the non record-breaking ones) below the line my loathing of treadmills is well documented on this blog, and i hold to my theory that treadmill miles relate to outdoor miles in the same way that dog years relate to human years - they are at least seven times longer. which makes the fact thatsusie chanran for 12 hours on a treadmill on saturday (68.5 miles) breaking the world record in the process particularly jaw-dropping for me. it’s not so much the physical exertion that amazes me, though heaven knows that’s impressive enough. no, it’s the mental effort. it would be one thing to run 68.5 miles in a line, towards a destination, with a physical finish line to cross. but in a room, on a treadmill? that requires an effort of will i can’t even begin to imagine. well done susie. possibly a rest day today though, eh? my own weekend involved a curtailed track session, dropping out with a worryingly niggly calf, followed by a very tentative long run yesterday of 16 miles. plenty of calf raises and stretches for me over the next few weeks, and fingers crossed that it doesn’t develop into anything more serious. so, how was your weekend running? i saw lots ofwinter runmedal-wearers getting off various tubes and buses on my meanderings around london yesterday and spotted quite a few pbs on strava too. as always, share your own exploits below the line. this article includes content hosted on strava.com. we ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. to view this content,click 'allow and continue'."
"[editor’s note: this article was written by guest writer and runner,deki fourcin.] at 5:15 a.m. on the last day of the 2024 festival des templiers, the headlamps of 2,500 runners surged through the darkness as they began their journey through the heart of the grands causses regional natural park in france’s aveyron, for the 2024les templiers, or thegrand trail des templiersas it’s more formally called. exactly 6 hours, 38 minutes, and 14 seconds later,thomas cardin(france) crossed the finish line to win the men’s race.caitlin fielder(new zealand) dominated the women’s race, finishing in 7 hours, 42 minutes, and 24 seconds. after a rocky start to the week, when torrential rain and flooding threatened to disrupt the event, sunday’s race was blessed with balmy temperatures, sunshine, and mostly dry trails. the course covers 80.4 kilometers (50 miles), with 3,429 meters (11,250 feet) of elevation gain, setting off from millau and passing through the forests, canyons, and caves of the causse noir, the causse méjean, and the larzac plateau before returning to millau again. the race saw a significant increase in the prize money awarded to the top 10 finishers, with the first, second, and third places receiving €10,000, €4,000, and €3,000, respectively. the start of the 2024 grand trail des templiers. photo: greg alric the 2023 edition sawjulie rouxfrom france and the u.k.’sjonathan albonon the top step of the podium. with neither choosing to return to defend their titles, the door was wide open for two new names to be inscribed on the list of champions. les templiers is the climax of the three-day festival and is france’s oldest trail race. it’s known for drawing in a star-studded lineup, and in its 30th year, the 2024 edition was no exception. in the women’s race, fans were expecting a showdown between the french duo ofclémentine geoffrayandblandine l’hirondel, but it wasadeline martin(france) who took the early lead, dominating the race through 65 kilometers (40 miles). fielder bid her time, pouncing during the final section to take the lead. she increased her lead through the later stages, flying down the final descent into millau and crossing the line as the champion. the french delegation was strong in the men’s race too, withthéo détiennetaking an early lead beforethomas cardintook the reins around halfway through the race. cardin, who finished fourth in 2023, was a strong favorite, and his win marked the end of a six-year drought of french winners in the men’s race. by the race finish, cardin had totally run away with the race, finishing nearly 20 minutes ahead of second place. adeline martin(france) andjennifer lichter(u.s.) passed through the 8k mark together, followed by norway’ssylvia nordskar, france’sblandine l’hirondel, and new zealand’scaitlin fielder. by 23k, a lead group including martin, l’hirondel, and lichter had formed, coming through just in front of nordskar,clémentine geoffray, and fielder. martin used the next 500-meter climb to the massabiau checkpoint at 29k to her advantage, pulling away slightly from l’hirondel and lichter. hot on their heels, geoffray and fielder made sure that the podium stayed in sight."
"the passage through roquesaltes at 44k saw martin increase her lead to almost three minutes, with lichter and l’hirondel holding onto second and third positions. over the halfway point of the course, but with more than half of the elevation gain left to climb, less than three minutes separated positions two to seven. nothing could be taken for granted, and everything was still at play. martin held on to the gap on the next descent and the climb up and over to the la salvage checkpoint at 56k. l’hirondel, nordskar, fielder, and lichter continued their pursuit of martin there. the group kept their positions through the next couple kilometers, but then after that fielder and nordskar moved up to second and third, closing in continuously on martin. fielder and nordskar made their move on the steep descent into massebiau at 70k, storming onto the next climb in first and second before fielder disconnected from nordskar to take the ultimate lead. l’hirondel and geoffray were also there, now battling for third place. at this point, longtime leader martin had dropped back in the field by a bit. some 10 kilometers later at the finish, caitlin fielder crossed the line in first, holding a narrow 2.5-minute lead on the rest of the field. sylvia nordskar remained the second-place woman, also by a fairly narrow margin to third place, blandine l’hirondel. only 90 seconds later, clémentine geoffray finished fourth, and about 10 minutes passed before fifth-place jennifer lichter next crossed the line. after leading the race for so many kilometers, adeline martin ultimately took eighth. the 2024 grand trail des templiers women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. sylvia nordskar, 1. caitlin fielder, 3. blandine l’hirondel. photo: cyrille quintard full results. caitlin fielder, the 2024 grand trail des templiers women’s champion. photo: cyrille quintard it was france’sthéo détiennewho took charge early on, passing through the 8k checkpoint around a minute ahead of the pack. there was some trading of places in the early miles, but by 23k, détienne was two minutes ahead ofthomas cardinandrobin juillaguet, both of france. just behind, the lead peloton of 11 runners was still going strong, leaving the way open for anyone hoping to make a move. by 29k, although the runners were less bunched, there wasn’t much change to the order, with the top three holding firm, followed byaziz yachou(morocco) andsébastien spehler(france). the sun was rising over the mountain peaks as runners approached st. andrée de vezines at 36k, and a determined-looking détienne came through the village after two hours and 44 minutes of racing, with yachou, cardin, and juillaguet in hot pursuit, around 1.5 minutes later. cardin used the passage to 44k to his advantage, catching up with the leader, then taking the lead during the descent after that. yachou and juillaguet had also gained on détienne, meaning that with 30k to go, the top four runners were all within a minute of each other. the section up to la salvage at 56k climbs onto the larzac plateau, featuring technical singletrack and nearly 500 meters of elevation gain over 8k."
"for the first time, there was a clear distinction between the top three places, with six minutes separating cardin, yachou, and juillaguet. by the time cardin arrived at mas de bru, with 16k to go, it seemed that his victory would be undeniable, having extended his lead over yachou to six minutes. cardin continued to power on in his victory quest, storming tirelessly up the final climb. by the time he reached the top, 7k from the finish line, he was over 17 minutes ahead ofmiguel arsénio(portugal), who’d overtaken yachou to move into second place. next to the top, and right on the heels of yachou, wasandreu simón(spain), and just behind, détienne, determined not to lose sight of the podium. simón had started the race more easily, moving up into and through the top 10 as the race progressed. here, he’d placed himself in podium contention. in the last kilometers, simón overtook yachou, to move into third place. this ultimately settled the top five positions for the last downhill to the finishing arch, with thomas cardin storming over the line ahead of second-place finisher miguel arsénio, followed by andreu simón in third place. rounding out the top five were aziz yachou and early leader théo détienne. sébastien spehler ultimately finished well outside of the top 10. the 2024 grand trail des templiers men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. miguel arsénio, 1. thomas cardin, 3. andreu simón. photo: cyrille quintard full results. related articles:"

"the eighth race of the 2024 golden trail world series, and the last before the final, themammoth trail fest 26kkicked off in mammoth lakes, california, at 10 a.m. on sunday, august 22. the 16.1-mile course, starting and ending in mammoth village, has more than 3,900 feet of climbing and tops out at 11,053 feet, making it a proper high-altitude race. racers were greeted with cool, clear, and sunny conditions on race morning. the women started 20 minutes ahead of the men, providing them with their own race. golden trail world series leaderjoyce muthoni njeruof kenya took the early lead and never gave it up, finishing nearly three minutes ahead of romania’smădălina florea. in the men’s race, the top four in the series standings ran together earlier on beforeelhousine elazzaouiof morocco andpatrick kipngenoof kenya pulled away over the summit of mammoth mountain and ran together for the rest of the race to a sprint finish, where elazzaoui came away with the win. the event is the queen event of the three-day mammoth trail fest event. with a $21,000 prize purse up for grabs and prize money going 10 deep — as well as points leading into the golden trail world series final up for grabs — the field was filled with some of the best shorter-distance trail racers vying for the top spot on the podium. after leaving the village, the single-loop course climbs steeply to the top of mammoth mountain in the first 7.5 miles, gaining nearly all of its elevation in the span of three miles along the dragon’s back. from the summit, it drops steeply to the mccoy aid station, tackling the new bullet downhill, before starting a more gradual descent on mountain bike trails back into the village for a final romp through the streets to the finish line. joyce muthoni njeruof kenya, the current leader of the golden trail world series, didn’t waste any time, taking off from the start to establish an early lead in the women’s race. by the first aid station at twin lakes, 3.6 miles and 25:21 in, but before any of the steep climbing, she’d already opened up an 18-second gap on second-placemădălina floreaof romania and a 39-second gap on third-placelauren gregory. joyce muthoni njeru, the 2024 mammoth trail fest 26k women’s winner. photo: sarah attar muthoni njeru reached the summit of mammoth mountain, 7.5 miles into the race, at 1:14:29, leading florea by more than two minutes. but coming over the top, florea opened up her stride, not ready to surrender the race. behind them, on the steep, rocky, and switchbacking climb up to the summit of mammoth mountain,rachel drakeput in a huge effort to move into third over the summit, two and a half minutes behind florea and with a 17-second lead onanna gibsonin fourth place. gregory was just another 30 seconds back in fifth, the spots for the podium still up for grabs on the long downhill."
"florea held a fast pace on the initial miles of the downhill, looking to be running much more aggressively than muthoni njeru on the wider open sections on the ski resort, but was unable to close the gap. coming into the mccoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles in 1:37:24, muthoni njeru held a 2:09 lead on florea, while drake and gibson ran together another 4:38 back. gregory was only a minute back from the duo, still within reach of third. after mccoy, racers faced the bullet downhill, a newly added section of steep and technical downhill on the course. the steeper sections didn’t slow anyone down, and as the race reached the flatter mountain bike trails, muthoni njeru continued to hold a strong pace in the lead, reaching the garage checkpoint at mile 14.8 in 1:56:45. florea was 1:56 behind with a significant six-minute gap over third-place drake and fourth-place gibson, who continued to run together. joyce muthoni njeru cruised into the finish without any pressure with a time of 2:11:56, taking her third win in the series and further padding her overall series lead, and mădălina florea finished second in 2:14:51, after taking a fall and cutting her knee. anna gibson used her background in the track to pull away from drake on the gradual downhill to take third.

"in the early miles of the downhill, elazzaoui let kipngeno set the pace on the twisting singletrack, and the two came into the mccoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles together in 1:21:38. elazzaoui continued to stay behind kipngeno, letting small gaps open before cutting the apex of the corners, taking slightly shorter routes to repeatedly close the gap. when the two came to the new, and steep, bullet downhill section, elazzaoui, who had been clearly biding his time, made his move and quickly opened a significant gap with only a few miles to go. at the garage checkpoint, elazzaoui, who is not known for liking to lead alone, was back with kipngeno with 2.3 miles to go, setting the pair up for a sprint finish. behind them, bonnet was three minutes back. in the final streets, elazzaoui opened up the sprint first, and when kipngeno tried to get by on the inside of a corner, he found himself blocked by the moroccan and had to hit the brakes. elazzaoui took the win in 1:49:35 and also took the overall lead for the golden trail world series going into the final. ombogo kiriago came in third ahead of last year’s winner bonnet. elhousine elazzaoui wins the sprint finish with patrick kipngeno, to take victory at the 2024 mammoth trail fest 26k. photo: sarah attar full results. related articles:"

"“the cards that i have in my hand this year are different,” he said, “but also, i wouldn’t be lining up if i didn’t think i had a chance to compete up front.” and for nearly nine hours, that’s exactly what he did. walmsley, wearing bib no. 2, started with the pack but took the lead by 35k as the climbing — and night — set in. he ran at the front for the next several hours, stopping for two minutes at the les chapieux aid station (51k), and came into lac combal (70k) looking strong and still in the lead, leaving in less than 90 seconds. the start of the 2024 utmb. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein but between there and courmayeur at 83k, he began to struggle, dropping nine places to 10th and 13 minutes off the lead. as he entered the large aid station that serves as the near halfway point of the race, he looked rough. while the race leaders were efficient with their stops, walmsley sat to eat for a relatively long time and did not look like he wanted to get up. he would later officially drop, a tough conclusion to a promising race for the champion. winning the western states 100-utmb double still seems to be one of the most challenging feats in men’s ultrarunning. “jim has been struggling to shake a knee injury since western states,” reada post on his instagram story, “but wanted to give himself the chance to see what the day would give him.” walmsley was not the only of the pre-race favorites to drop out. the u.k.’stom evans(pre-race interview) — who followed up a third-place finish at the 2022 utmb by winning the western states 100 last year — had a very similar race to walmsley, running near the front for the first half of the race and entering courmayeur in second. he was part of a large chase pack that had passed walmsley by 83k and spent less than three minutes at the large aid station, leaving in third behind frenchmangermain grangier(pre-race interview) and eventual championvincent bouillard(post-race interview), another frenchman. jim walmsley and tom evans leading the 2024 utmb in les contamines at 31k. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi by refuge bertone at 88k, though, he began to look fatigued and though he remained in the top five until 101k, by grand col ferret at 106k he had dropped 23 places to 28th. he would also later drop — another top contender out of the race. “tom has sadly had to withdraw. he is okay and with family and friends,” read apost on his instagram story. “fueling became an issue through the night and you can’t run this race on empty.” the carnage, unfortunately, did not stop there, either. grangier looked strong for more than 115k, running in second and charging up the hill at grand col ferret at 106k and looking calm at la fouly 10 kilometers later, only six minutes behind bouillard."
"he stayed in second as the morning came, but looked fatigued by trient at 146k, where he would also drop. frenchmenmathieu blanchard, who famously battled jornet at the2022 utmb for a second-place finish, andaurélien dunand-pallaz(pre-race interview), whowon both the hardrock 100and diagonal des fous in 2023, both dropped at 69k, while spain’spau capell, the2019 utmb winner, dropped at courmayeur like walmsley. germain grangier runs into champex-lac during (128.5k) the 2024 utmb. he would drop late in the race. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi none of this is to take away from the brilliance of bouillard or the other top finishers, who survived the historic carnage and heat to come away with some performances of a lifetime. it starts and ends, of course, with bouillard, who was on few people’s radar when the race began. last year, bouillard, who does not even have a photo on hisofficial utmb page, won the kodiak 100 mile and gorge waterfall 100k, but few expected him to compete at the world’s most competitive trail race. he did exactly that. wearing bib no. 139, bouillard ran in the lead pack at the start of the race, coming through refuge de la croix du bonhomme at 46k in ninth, and methodically working his way up to the front, entering lac combal at 70k in second. by courmayeur, he had taken the lead and spent less than three minutes refueling before heading back into the early morning darkness. from there, he would not relinquish the lead, running the rest of the race relatively unchallenged as he continued to look strong and smooth as the sun rose. later in the morning, he would cross the finish line to seal a strong and surprising win. men’s champion vincent bouillard descends into vallorcine (158k), on his way to winning the 2024 utmb. photo: irunfar/sarah brady while bouillard won by nearly 30 minutes, there was a true race behind him. france’sbaptiste chassagne(post-race interview) ran in the top 20 for most of the first 60k and entered courmayeur in 11th. by 129k, he and fellow frenchmanarthur joyeux-bouillon, who had taken the opposite approach by running at or near the front from the start, were within seconds of each other in fourth and fifth place, respectively, and 34 minutes behind bouillard. chassagne continued to look and run strong, entering trient at 146k in second just ahead of the ecuadorian living in spain,joaquín lópez(post-race interview), where he would remain until he crossed the finish line in 20:22:45 for his most impressive finish of his six-year streak of a top 10 at a utmb mont blanc festival race. baptiste chassagne was pretty stoked to take second at the 2024 utmb. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks lópez, meanwhile, had a very similar race to chassagne, running in the top 30 at the start of the race before moving into 10th position by the time he left courmayeur. over the final half of the race, he moved up even further, and was just four minutes behind chassagne at 161k."

(of course, last year,courtney dauwalter, who did not race utmb this year, won each race in the western states 100-hardrock 100-utmb triple.) in her pre-race interview, schide, who lives and trains in france, admitted that her primary focus this season was on the western states 100 and that she took the runner’s insurance for utmb when she signed up in january in case she canceled. after she dominated an impressively deep and competitive field on saturday, though, it was hard to believe utmb was not the top race on her calendar this year. katie schide in la floria just 4k from the finish and a new utmb course record. photo: irunfar/amiria macbeth schide went out fast and kept that assertive pace for nearly an entire day of running. she was 21st overall at the first aid station at 13k; new zealand’sruth croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and canadian living in francemarianne hogan(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the eventual second- and third-place finishers were, respectively, 118th and 72nd overall there. schide did not take her foot off the gas and continued to run with her characteristic calm, strength, and smile, entering the lac combal aid station at 70k in 7:34, looking focused. by courmayeur at 83k, she was 50 minutes under course-record pace and nearly 40 minutes ahead of hogan, and by la fouly at 116k, she was nearly an hour under record pace. the only question from there was if she would set the record."
"with hogan losing 10 minutes in 12 kilometers by 141k to fall to 40 minutes back, schide’s win seemed close to inevitable, especially with the way she was running. just before vallorcine at 158k, schide’s lead on the course record had lessened to 32 minutes and a few kilometers later she was working hard and taking encouragement from fans. with four kilometers to go, she smiled as the crowds cheered her on, knowing that history was just minutes away. she reached chamonix and the celebration began. schide smiled to the crowd and gave several high fives before crossing the finish line more than 20 minutes faster than any woman had done before, and the double was complete. katie schide after winning utmb for the second time. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks if schide was chasing history, croft was chasing dozens of runners in front of her. croft, who was forced to withdraw before the start of last year’s race due to illness, came into utmb as one of the favorites, having won the tarawera ultramarathon and transvulcania earlier this year. she ran conservatively at the start, coming through 31k in sixth place next to americanamanda basham, 22 minutes off the lead, and later falling to ninth place almost 38 minutes back just over 10 kilometers later. but by 88k, with about half of the race in front of her, croft had moved up to fifth, next toemily hawgoodof zimbabwe, who lives in the u.s, and from there she kept moving up. at the grand col ferret at 106k, she was in fourth behind schide, hogan, and2023 third-place finisherblandine l’hirondelof france, but croft did not hang around: she broke into a run as soon as she started the descent. ruth croft flying through champex-lac (128.5k). photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi by 129k, she had passed l’hirondel and was in third place, looking fast and determined. at trient, 17 kilometers later and about a half-hour behind hogan, croft was the only woman to run through the entire section and looked to be on the hunt. by 158k, she had cut hogan’s lead to 14 minutes and looked the stronger of the two, flying downhill and making up time. between there and the climb up to la flégère, croft finally passed hogan and left six minutes ahead. with four kilometers to go, she was in second and flying to the finish. she’d reach it in 22:48:37, just over 22 minutes ahead of hogan, in her debut at the race. hogan,who finished second in her 2022 utmb debut, had another strong race, running in second for most of the day with a smile on her face, before fading late. she didn’t let falling to third dampen her spirits, high-fiving fans and enjoying their cheers at la floria four kilometers from the finish after being passed by croft. after crossing the line in 23:11:15, she was greeted by a large team at the finish to celebrate her second podium finish in three years. marianne hogan running through champex-lac in second."

"photo: world mountain running association/marco gulberti running with muthoni njeru wasmonica mădălina florea(romania), who recently took second at the 2024 marathon du mont blanc. as the runners entered the next checkpoint at chandolin, muthoni njeru overtook adkin for second place, but this lead was seemingly short lived. on the descent to tignousa at 16k, it looked as though muthoni njeru had overcooked it, and adkin made a strong attack, retaining her second-place position. adkin passed the checkpoint 29 seconds ahead of muthoni njeru. florea continued to maintain her position in fourth a minute back, whilstphilaries jeruto kisang(kenya) came through in fifth a couple of minutes later. unfortunately for muthoni njeru, she continued to fade, and this worked to florea’s advantage. she overtook to take over third place around the 20k mark, now less than two minutes behind adkin in second. as a powerful downhill runner, this was a chance for florea to make up ground, but adkin maintained her position all the way to the finish line. joyline chepngeno crossed the finish line in 2:54:06, taking a huge win. she was followed by scout adkin, who finished in 3:02:21, and monica mădălina florea in third in 3:04:29. philaries jeruto kisang moved up to fourth and finished in 3:05:52, andcristina simion(romania) finished fifth in 3:07:51. joyce muthoni njeru dropped out of the top 10 and finished in 12th in 3:13:30. monica mădălina florea celebrates third place at the 2024 sierre-zinal. photo: world mountain running association/marco gulberti full results. it was a bold but expected start to the race from favoritekilian jornet(spain, lives in norway), who already had nine wins to his name on the revered route. he started at the front of the race and looked to have a significant gap on the rest of the field. kilian jornet winning the 2024 sierre-zinal in a sprint finish. photo: world mountain running association/marco gulberti however, at the ponchette checkpoint, 7.5k in,josphat kiprotich(kenya) had closed the gap and came through hot on jornet’s heels. switzerland’srémi bonnet, the 2022 and 2023 golden trail world series overall winner, came through next, followed bypatrick kipngenoandpaul machokaof kenya. the first twist of the men’s race came shortly thereafter, when kiprotich overtook jornet. this is where the first battle at the front of the men’s race commenced and it was a cat-and-mouse chase between the two athletes, with kiprotich running within 15 seconds of course record pace at the 12k mark. by halfway, kiprotich still had a modest lead, coming through the checkpoint in 1:23:15, followed by jornet in 1:24:01. whilst the battle ensued for first, kipngeno and bonnet worked together to hold onto third and fourth positions, as they passed through the 16k mark together in 1:25:26.philemon ombogo kiriago(kenya), the 2023 sierre-zinal champion, had by now managed to overtake machoka to move into fifth place. philemon ombogo kiriago is all smiles after a second-place finish at the 2024 sierre-zinal. photo: world mountain running association/marco gulberti after the 20k mark, where most of the climbing had been completed, the race really became unpredictable."
"jornet caught up with kiprotich and they passed the 20k checkpoint in 1:43:17, but this is where jornet made his attack. he created a 30-second lead on second place, and rolled along the trails whilst others battled it out behind. although kipngeno and bonnet hit hotel weisshorn at the same time (1:45:03), it was kipngeno who went for the attack and overtook kiprotich for second place. but that wasn’t the end. kipngeno’s training partner ombogo kiriago steamed ahead, and with a polite tap on the back, powered past kipngeno and had his sights set on jornet. on the technical descent toward the finish line, it looked like jornet had a comfortable lead when ombogo kiriago came out of nowhere to overtake the nine-time winner and even gained on him. this was by far the biggest shock of the race, and it wasn’t long before jornet drove down the descent hard to reclaim first position, but he had to work for it all the way to the finish line. ombogo kiriago was chasing hard, and the sprint finish through the streets of zinal led kilian jornet to win and also take a new course record, finishing in 2:25:34, beating his previous 2019 course record by a single second. philemon ombogo kiriago finished just behind in 2:25:36 and the two athletes collapsed as they crossed the line. patrick kipngeno held third position and crossed the line in 2:26:59, followed by josphat kiprotich in 2:31:35 in fourth, androberto delorenzi(switzerland) in 2:32:26 for fifth place. paul mochoka ultimately took sixth in 2:32:35, and rémi bonnet faded during the latter end of the race and dropped back to ninth position, crossing in 2:33:57. patrick kipngeno taking third at the 2024 sierre-zinal. photo: world mountain running association/marco gulberti full results. related articles:"
"the 2024speedgoat by utmb 50kkicked off at 6:30 a.m. local time on saturday, july 20, high in utah’s wasatch mountains at the famous snowbird ski resort. once all 32 miles (52 kilometers) and 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) of climbing were complete,david sinclairhad a new course record, while canada’sjazmine lowtherled the women’s race from wire to wire. the weather was truly typical for a high-altitude summer day: fresh crispness in the morning, eventually yielding to a full sun whose heat always feels stronger at altitude. sinclair’s no-contest treatment of both the course and the men’s field showed that he was far-and-away the best men’s runner of the day.samuel hendry’s(canada) performance for second place, while holding that position for basically the whole race, was also dominant. and for lowther, though the women’s race ran more closely, she, too, showed strength to stay ahead of a big chasing field, including significant pressure from second place bymali noyes, who made her presence known in the second half of the race. read on for more of this year’s speedgoat 50k story. the start of the 2024 speedgoat by utmb 50k. photo: nils nilsen it was a tight start to the men’s race, but that didn’t last long. through the first checkpoint at mile four, a group of eight men rolled through within a minute of each other. then, at about mile nine and the top of the first major climb, the summit of 11,000-plus-foot hidden peak, two men,david sinclairandsamuel hendry(canada), who would ultimately go one-two at the finish, passed through together, with more than two minutes on the rest of the field. sinclair is familiar with this race, having finished it three times and won it twice before, as recently as 2022. hendry, an elite cross-country skier and skilled shorter-distance trail runner, looked to be moving up in distance with this race. behind them at mile nine, the top-10 men had strung out to within seven minutes of the lead. among that group and pushing the pace wasadam peterman, a prior speedgoat 50k champion and the then course record holder, andscott patterson, a two-time olympian in cross-country skiing and a mountain runner. from here on, though, it was the sinclair show, as at each checkpoint, his gap on hendry — as well as the rest of the field — increased. by mile 20 at the mineral basin checkpoint, on the backside of snowbird ski resort, sinclair’s lead was just shy of nine minutes, and it only extended from there. for the race’s final third, it was only the clock that sinclair raced. when he crossed the line, after summiting hidden peak a second time, racking up a boatload of vertical, and taking the fast-and-furious descent back to the base of the ski resort, david sinclair won in 4:57:35. this broke the previous course record of 5:04:31 set by peterman in 2021. sinclair also shaved over 11 minutes off his previous time when he won the race in 2022. david sinclair on his way to winning and setting a course record at the 2024 speedgoat 50k."
"photo: nils nilsen onto the rest of the men’s race. for as dominant as sinclair was in first place, so was hendry in second. by mile 20, hendry had built a four-minute lead over the rest of the field, which he would hold at each aid station until the finish. samuel hendry ultimately crossed the finish line comfortably in second place in 5:24:57, with more than seven minutes on the next chasing man. at every single aid station, it was patterson holding a strong third place. so when the olympian scott patterson crossed the line in third with a time of 5:32:26, it should not have come as surprise ending. david hedgestook fourth in 5:38:35 andgrant barnettefifth in 5:45:56. early pace pusher peterman ultimately found his way to the finish in sixth. scott patterson crossing the 2024 speedgoat 50k finish line in third place. photo: nils nilsen full results. while the women’s race for the win ran much more closely than in the men’s, canada’sjazmine lowthertook the lead from the get-go, never gave in as women ran closely behind her, and put the hammer down to crush the final descent — and the rest of the women’s field. lowther was coming to this race after recovering from a longer-term injury that followed a pretty incredible couple years of ultrarunning, which saw her win the 2022 canyons by utmb 100k and take second at the 2023 transgrancanaria. to look at lowther’s lead over her closest chaser, as the race progressed, it bounced from about a minute at the first checkpoint at mile four and over hidden peak for the first time at mile nine, before growing to more than 3.5 minutes by mile 20. she gave back some of that time in the next five rough and verty miles, holding just an 80-second lead when she summited hidden peak for the second time at mile 25 and began the big descent to the finish. over those final seven-ish miles, lowther put six minutes on second place. that cracking descent from jazmine lowther ensured her victory and she crossed the finish line in 6:15:05. jazmine lowther, 2024 speedgoat 50k champion. photo: nils nilsen the race for the rest of the women’s top five was highly dynamic, with women moving around for much of the race. the closest chasers at the first checkpoint at mile four wereemkay sullivanandmartina valmassoi(italy), the former of whom would remain dominant all race and the latter of whom would need to drop due to physical issues. after over 6,000 feet of climb since the start of the race, over the first summit of hidden peak at mile nine,emily caldwellalso made her presence known, passing over hidden peak in second place, with sullivan right there in third. over the next 11 miles, another runner presented herself a challenger,mali noyes, a prior two-time finisher who took second last year. the cross-country and downhill skier at least partially converted to trail running a few years ago, and has been racking up experience in american trail races."
"noyes moved into second place for the women before mile 18 and then held it to the finish. mali noyes’s impressive climb up the leaderboard in the first half, before holding steady in the race’s second half, led her to finish in second place in 6:22:31. much like noyes in second place moved into that position before mile 18, so did ultimate women’s third-place finisherkodi kleven. kleven is a local runner, coach, and former collegiate runner who finished seventh at the 2022 speedgoat 50k, so she was looking to move up this year. and also like noyes, kleven’s gap on the rest of the field stayed fairly close and fluctuated. for kleven, her breakaway from the rest of the field took place on the beefy climb back up to hidden peak for a second time at mile 25. there, kleven had carved out a fairly comfortable seven-minute lead, which she extended to 11 minutes by the finish line. kodi kleven crossed the finish line in 6:24:12 for third place. emkay sullivan ultimately finished fourth in 6:35:09.lindsay allisonalso moved up during the latter half of the race, finishing in fifth in 6:41:39. kodi kleven finishing third at the 2024 speedgoat 50k. photo: nils nilsen full results. related articles:"
"it was,ludovic pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said, a dream when he kissed the rock at the end of the 2024hardrock 100. he finished his lap around the san juan mountains of colorado with a new overall course record of 21:33:06, breakingkilian jornet’sprevious record, set in 2022, by just over three minutes. pommeret, a 48-year-old frenchman, led almost wire-to-wire in a commanding fashion. “i dream all the day,” pommeret said at the iconic rock-kissing finish just past 3:30 a.m. local time on saturday, july 13, 2024. “the nightmare never came.” neither did it come for the women’s winnercourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who seems to redefine what is possible in ultrarunning every time she toes the line. dauwalter won the women’s race in 26:11:49, setting a new overall women’s course record, breaking her own mark of 26:14:12set last yearas the second race ofher historic western states 100-hardrock 100-utmb triple. that means dauwalter, who also led essentially wire-to-wire, has set a course record the past three times she’s run and owns the fastest three women’s times. courtney dauwalter early in the 2024 hardrock 100, on her way to a third victory at this race in course-record time. photo: irunfar/bryon powell but before the two champions got back to the rock, there was a lot of running to do. at 6 a.m. local time on friday, july 12, 146 runners set off in the predawn darkness under the watchful gaze of the san juan mountains in silverton, colorado, to begin one of the most famous, arduous, andscenically stunning100-mile races in the world. the hardrock 100, famous for itsdifficultyandselectiveness, is a 102.5-mile trek featuring more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain and an average elevation of 11,000 feet through the rugged san juans. it alternates directions every year, and this year’s race went clockwise. starting in the smallminingtown of silverton, runners made their way to telluride before continuing on to ouray and near lake city and then returned to silverton to kiss the iconic rock. the course, often impacted by snow, was mostly snow-free this year, and temperatures vacillated between sub-40 degrees and 80 degrees fahrenheit throughout the day and night. “it’s 100 miles. it’s huge mountains. it’s altitude,” dauwalter said in her pre-race interview with irunfar. “so, adventure is guaranteed for sure.” read on for more details about that adventure. thank you so much totailwindfor sponsoring irunfar’s coverage of the 2024 hardrock 100! thanks also tofractelfor sponsoring our race coverage. entering the race, it was fair to wonder what drovecourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) to return to the event again. over the past two years, she’d won twice and set course records in both directions. but she was back, she said during her pre-race interview with irunfar, because she still felt that she had left something on the course. “i am back because all of my runs here have had just really significant chunks of time that were spent in very low places,” she said."
"“i would love to try to smooth out those lows just a little bit, and see if i can get around that course without having so many huge hours.” and while she struggled with stomach issues for some of the second half of the run, she still reset the overall course record, breaking her previous clockwise record by more than 30 minutes. dauwalter, whowon the transgrancanaria 126kand the mt. fuji 100 mile already this year, is so consistently dominant that her wins in major ultras can seem like a foregone conclusion. but hardrock is never easy, and she still had to cover the 100-plus miles and 33,000-plus feet of elevation gain. once again, she did it faster than any woman ever had before her, including herself. katharina hartmuth and courtney dauwalter enjoying the early miles of the 2024 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks france’scamille bruyas(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and germany’skatharina hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) posed the biggest challenges to dauwalter. both had finished second by dauwalter at utmb in 2021 and 2023, respectively, and both had spent the last few weeks in the u.s. acclimating to the high elevations and learning the terrain. while dauwalter had opened a small gap on bruyas at the kamm traverse aid station (mile 11) and maintained it through chapman at mile 18, by telluride at mile 28, bruyas had closed the gap and came through in the co-lead with dauwalter, two minutes under course record pace. dauwalter slowly began to pull away — five minutes up at kroger’s canteen at mile 33 and six minutes by ouray at mile 44 — before making a strong move to increase her lead over bruyas to 31 minutes by mile 52. at that point, just over halfway, it was dauwalter, followed by bruyas, hartmuth,tara dower(pre-race interview), and france’sclaire bannwarthrounding out the top five. katharina hartmuth runs into the town of ouray on her way to taking third at the 2024 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi from there, dauwalter continued to run alone. smiling and moving swiftly in a bright yellow shirt, she was 18 minutes under course-record pace by animas forks aid station at mile 58, making quick work of the aid station and picking up her pacer. one of the few signs of fatigue she showed all race was at the sherman aid station at mile 73, after climbing and descending from handies peak, the course’s high point at 14,058 feet. she stayed for five minutes to rest and refuel before running on into the dark. by maggie gulch at mile 87, she was nearly an hour under course-record pace and looked strong. six miles later, at cunningham gulch, she picked up her husband as her pacer as they made their way up and over the final climb. less than three hours later and now in the early-morning sun, dauwalter returned to the rock, and kissed it once more."

"americanzach miller, who wassecond in last year’s utmband had put ina monster training blockin preparation for hardrock, was among the favorites, but did not race following an emergency appendectomy on july 5. ever the optimist and making the most of a disappointing situation, miller spent part of saturday morningmaking his patented donuts for fans. along with miller, france’sfrançois d’haene(pre-race interview) was expected to contend for the win, even if he had been coming back from injury and not feeling 100% leading up to race day due to an illness a few weeks ahead of time. d’haene, one of the best runners in the world at long mountainous ultras, set the counter-clockwise course record for the win in 2021 before placing second behindkilian jornetin 2022 in the clockwise direction. entering the race, d’haene had two of the fastest three times in race history. from right to left, it’s ludo pommeret, françois d’haene, and diego pazos in the early miles of the 2024 hardrock 100. pommeret and pazos would finish one-two, while d’haene would be forced to drop after midway. photo: irunfar/bryon powell and whileludovic pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was certainly expected to be among the top contenders this year, it’s probably fair to say he was not the favorite. but once the race began, the frenchman made his intentions clear. pommeret, who was running his first full hardrock after pacing for last year’s winneraurélien dunand-pallaz, arrived in silverton on june 14 and completed two laps of the course as multi-day trips, otherwise known as softrocks, as part of a month-long training block to acclimatize to the altitude and mountains. that fitness and preparation were clear from the moment the race began when pommeret led a pack of runners, including d’haene,jason schlarb(post-race interview), and switzerland’sdiego pazos(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) through the rainbow trail at mile 1.5. françois d’haene in the early miles of the 2024 hardrock 100. a pre-race favorite, he had to retire after the halfway point due to physical issues from a recent illness. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks at kamm traverse (mile 11), pommeret, d’haene, and pazos all came through in the lead together. by mile 28, when pommeret entered telluride in 5:34 elapsed, he was two minutes below course-record pace, with d’haene 2.5 minutes behind him. then began the famous 4,300-foot ascent to kroger’s canteen aid station, which sits at 13,100 feet above sea level at mile 33. pommeret came through in the lead again, smiling and drinking coke before leaving after only a minute. d’haene was still close behind, and schlarb — whotied jornet for the win at hardrockin 2016 and has been recovering from a torn acl from a skiing accident two years ago — came through in third, 32 minutes off the lead. “it’s hard to feel good up here,” schlarb said, drinking only water and leaving quickly. pazos, who has several strong finishes at utmb, came across the iconic pass four minutes behind schlarb. jason schlarb running strong into chapman aid station, 18 miles into the 2024 hardrock 100. he would ultimately take third place."
"photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi it was on the descent to ouray that pommeret began to open up a gap. by ouray (mile 44), the gap to d’haene, who began to show signs of fatigue on a hot, humid section of the course, was 23 minutes. it was a stark contrast to pommeret, who looked as smooth as ever. at just over the halfway mark (mile 52), the top four men were pommeret, d’haene at 62 minutes off the lead, schlarb just two minutes behind him, and pazos a further 11 minutes back. by animas forks at mile 58, pommeret had increased his lead to 1 hour and 24 minutes, and schlarb, despite puking, and pazos had passed d’haene, who was sadly in tears at the aid station. d’haene dropped from the race soon after, saying, “you don’t know if you don’t play.” he was clearly still feeling the after-effects of an illness just 10 days prior. pommeret continued cruising. he looked smooth and efficient at the next several aid stations, refueling quickly before continuing his record day. at the sherman aid station at mile 73, now 22 minutes ahead of course-record pace, pommeret was animated and sprinted away after a three-minute stop, less than 20 miles from history. almost exactly seven hours later — after three more characteristically short stops at the remaining aid stations — pommeret made history, running the final few steps in the cold dark before hugging the rock that had awaited him for the past 21-plus hours. he was officially a hardrock champion and course-record holder. pommeret’s win is a testament to his longevity: he ran his first utmb 20 years ago,won it in 2016, and now, eight years later, has won hardrock. both d’haene and miller were at the finish line to congratulate the new champion. after d’haene dropped, the battle for second was between schlarb and pazos. schlarb was in front by 13 minutes at mile 62.5, but pazos looked determined to reel him in. by sherman at mile 73, schlarb reported that he had been cramping for most of the race, while pazos, who quietly devoured a cup of noodles, had cut into his lead. diego pazos at the maggie gulch aid station, mile 87, not long after moving into second place at the 2024 hardrock 100, a position he’d hold until the finish. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks fourteen miles later at maggie gulch (mile 87), pazos still looked strong and had passed schlarb, who said he was battling nausea and getting in his nutrition. pazos had turned a nine-minute deficit into a six-minute lead. that order would remain until the finish, with diego pazos taking second in 24:39:33 and jason schlarb coming in third in 24:48:13. jeff rome, thesecond-place finisher in 2018who lives just blocks away from the start of the race and was quoting j.r.r. tolkien at aid stations, ran an extremely consistent second half of the race to claim fourth, whilebrian petersontook fifth after emerging from a crowded back half of the men’s top 10 over the last 25 miles."

"farvard — a 28-year-old from mammoth lakes, california, who has improved his finish each year at the race, from a dnf in 2021 to 41st place in 2022 to 11th place last year — put himself in a strong position from the start, leading a large pack of runners that included walmsley at the top of the escarpment, the 2,500-foot climb in the first four miles of the race. for the next 45-plus miles, farvard remained in the top 10, part of a chase pack of americanhayden hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), kiwidan jones(pre-race interview), and chinese runnerguo-min deng, among others. dan jones (left) and hayden hawks rolling through robinson flat during the 2024 western states 100. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at the robinson flat aid station at mile 30 — the symbolic end of the runners’ time in the high country, which features an average elevation of around 7,000 feet — walmsley, who started the race conspicuously wearing all black, came through in 4:24 looking fast and smooth, now wearing an ice-soaked white shirt. jones,the 2024 tarawera 102k championand fifth-place finisher in his western states debut last year, and hawks,who set the course record at february’s black canyons 100kafter dropping out of last year’s western states, followed about 90 seconds later. the two runners, frequent training partners, ran together frequently throughout the day, with hawks often foregoing ice at aid stations. after the trio of walmsley, hawks, and jones went through last chance at mile 43 together, walmsley put nearly two minutes on them up the climb to devil’s thumb. “i was with everybody at the bottom,” he said, according to the race’s official livestream. about halfway through, at mile 49.5, the order remained the same: walmsley in the lead with an elapsed time of 6:58, followed by jones one minute back, hawks two minutes back, and farvard just over two and a half minutes back. the rest of the top 10 were last year’s 17th-place finisherdakota jones;2024 transvulcania ultramarathonchampionjon albon(pre-race interview), who is from the u.k. but lives in norway; 2023 fourth-place finisherjia-sheng shen(china) (pre-race interview);2023 canyons 100kchampioncole watson; western states specialisttyler green(pre-race interview); andjupiter carera(mexico). cole watson (left, in orange) and tyler green (right) running through robinson flat. photo: irunfar/bryon powell then began a thrilling, chaotic second half of the race — featuring a gripping back-and-forth between walmsley and farvard, a wildfire near the course, a two-man river crossing, and a sprint finish on the track. it all started when walmsley entered michigan bluff at mile 55, again looking calm and in control, changing shirts and getting doused with ice. farvard came in just behind him and left the aid station first, leading the race for the first time since the first climb up the escarpment. the same routine took place seven miles later at foresthill: walmsley entering first, farvard leaving first. rod farvard finishing the climb to michigan bluff in second during the 2024 western states 100. photo: irunfar/bryon powell for the next 18 miles, the two runners alternated in the lead."

"at 5:30 a.m. on sunday, june 9, in the raucous darkness of durban, south africa, more than 20,000 runners, powered by nerves, adrenaline, and the “chariots of fire” theme song, crossed the start line of the 2024comrades marathonto take part in the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world: nearly 86 kilometers of road running throughout the hills of south africa’s kwazulu-natal province. it was the 97th running of the event, which has only missed four editions since world war i veteranvic claphamstarted it in 1921 to commemorate the lives of south african soldiers. elite women before the start of the 2024 comrades marathon. eventual champ gerda steyn is at center left. photo: comrades marathon/paul henman two of the runners —gerda steyn, of south africa but who lives in the united arab emirates, on the women’s side andpietwiersmaof the netherlands on the men’s — cemented their names in race lore by taking home wins, and sizable paydays, in their respective races. the race has a massive prize purse, with a total 4,092,000 rand ($217,000) on the line. steyn, the defending champion, broke her own course record for the up run direction by more than nine minutes for her third win at comrades. she also holds the women’s course record for the down run when the race is held in the opposite direction, which she set in 2023. wiersma, meanwhile, backed up his impressive comrades debut last year — where he finished second only three seconds behind the winner — with his first win at the race. the comrades marathon famously alternates the direction each year, and this year’s race, which was run in relatively ideal conditions with temperatures ranging from the mid-50s to low-70s fahrenheit, was the 49th up race, meaning runners began in the lower-altitude durban and ended in the higher-altitude pietermaritzburg. the race featured around 1,750 meters of elevation gain, with most of it during the first half of the race, when the course runs through three of its “big five” hills. the up run, therefore, demands a smart, measured racing strategy. read on for full race details. the 2024 comrades marathon top three men and women at the post-race press conference (l-to-r): 3rd man degefa yohannese lafebo, 2nd man dan moselakwe, 1st man piet wiersma, 1st woman gerda steyn, 2nd woman alexandra morozova, and 3rd woman courtney olsen. photo: comrades marathon for the race’s first half,pietwiersma(the netherlands) seemed content to stay conservative and save his energy for the back half. a two-man pack ofjobo khatoane(lesotho), looking for his first comrades finish, andaleksei beresnev(russia), back for a second time after debuting inside the top 10 last year, were within a minute of each other at drummond, around the halfway mark, with the next runner more than five minutes back and wiersma sitting in 10th, almost nine-and-a-half minutes off the lead. but then wiersma dropped the hammer, increasing his pace to 3:37 per kilometer from 3:58 per kilometer to jump into the top five by the cato ridge checkpoint at 56.6 kilometers into the race."
"that seemingly set the tone for big moves for the race’s second half, where beresnev was still holding the lead and followed bydegefa yohannese lafebo(ethiopia). with this race, lafebo was moving up in distance following two top-10 finishes at the two oceans marathon, a 50k race. south africanstete dijana, the two-time defending champion, anddan moselakwe, a prior comrades podium finisher, sat in third and fourth, respectively. wiersma continued to run strong and moved into the lead by umlaas road, 67.5k, passing lafebo, and by mkondeni at 79.1k, he had increased to nearly a minute. behind him, beresnev dropped off the pace, while dijana couldn’t hang on, either. the pair would finish, but outside the top 10 this year. moselakwe took advantage of fading runners to move himself into second.joseph manyedi(south africa), meanwhile, methodically moved his way up to finish in fourth, his eighth and best comrades finish, whileandrew davies(u.k.) jumped from 12th to fifth over the course of the second half of the race. this was davies’ first comrades finish. at the finish line, wiersma would stay clear of moselakwe by 45 seconds and third-place finisher lafebo by nearly three minutes. piet wiersma, 2024 comrades marathon champion. photo: comrades marathon/paul henman full results. gerda steyn(south africa, lives in the united arab emirates), who won the comrades marathon in 2023 and 2019 and is also set to run the olympic marathon in paris, france, later this summer, was at or near the front of the race from the beginning. at the 5.5k and pinetown (18.5k) checkpoints, she sat in a group withcarla molinaro(u.k.) andloveness madziva(zimbabwe). molinaro was a six-time comrades finisher with her best performance last year in third place, and madziva was looking for her first comrades finish after lots of strong performances around the 50k distance. those three women led a tight pack of runners through winston park (29.6k), with the top 10 women all within six minutes of the lead. but then steyn picked up her pace by four seconds per kilometer to gap madziva by almost a minute by drummond (42.6k), about halfway into the race. by then, the 10th-place runner was more than 10 minutes back of steyn. steyn’s lead only increased over the latter half of the race, but behind her, there was significant movement within the field.alexandra morozova(russia), the 2022 champion and a many-time comrades podium finisher, made a big move between the umlaas road (67.5k) and mkondeni (79.1k) checkpoints, dropping her pace by nearly 10 seconds per kilometer to pass molinaro andnobukhosi tshuma(zimbabwe) and jump from fourth to second, a position she wouldn’t relinquish. tshuma was another runner looking to move up in distance after successful shorter-distance ultrarunning. perhaps the most dramatic move, though, came from americancourtney olsen, who methodically made her way into the lead pack throughout the race. by drummond, she was in ninth place before jumping three spots at umlaas road. as pietermaritzburg approached, olsen jumped three more spots to finish third. olsen’s incredible debut comrades follows up on prior top-five finishes at the iau 50k and 100k world championships."

"the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon getting underway. all photos courtesy of race. thetransvulcania ultramarathonis well-known for bringing in talented runners worldwide and being a highly competitive race. the 2024 edition was no different. early on the morning of saturday, may 11, racers set off on their 72-kilometer (44.7 miles) journey, starting at the southern tip of la palma island, one of the canary islands, at the lighthouse of el faro de fuencaliente. the race’s finish line is set on the island’s west side in the city of los llanos de aridane. racers had to use their strength as they accumulated around 14,000 feet (4,350 meters) of gain. the course is as beautiful as it is challenging. aside from the seemingly non-stop climbs to the course’s high point just after 50k and a 1,000-foot (320-meter) climb from the ocean to the finish, racers must somehow manage the nearly 8,000-foot (2,400 meters) descent from the high point to the ocean over the course of less than 11 miles (18k). dominated by singletrack, the course tackles challenging terrain, including loose volcanic pumice and sharp lava rock. five years after attempting the transvulcania ultramarathon and coming in fourth place,jon albonfinally found his way back to the island of la palma. he claimed his crown, winning the 2024 edition. on the women’s side,ruth croftalso found her way back to the island, in her case eight years had passed. she made up for the lost years and not only came away with the victory but also the women’s course record. read on for more of how the race played out. there were no fewer than 9 previous transvulcania wins represented on the start line, including dakota jones (left, 2 wins) and luis alberto hernando (right, 3 wins). the men’s race was one that wouldn’t be lost early, as at least 10 men rolled into the second aid station at deseadas (17k) within 73 seconds of the lead. there was a distinct lead pack withjeshurun smallanddakota jonesof the u.s.,tom evansandjon albonof the u.k, andthibaut baronianof france.ben stout(u.s.),dimtry mityaev(andorra),davide cheraz(italy), andantoine thiriat(france) were all within a minute of the lead. fourteen kilometers later, at el reventón (31k), four of the five essentially remained in the lead pack, with only jones dropping back to sixth while stout moved up into fifth at 2.5 and 2 minutes off the lead, respectively. technically, baronian was 19 seconds off the lead trio of albon, small, and evans. cheraz,ionel manole(romania, living in spain), mityaev, andtobias geiser(italy) rounded out the top 10. fast forward to the high point at el roque de los muchachos (51k), and we finally started to see some gaps between the top men, even if that was mostly albon pulling away from the rest of the leaders. indeed, albon hit el roque with a 4.5-minute lead on small and a 5.5-minute lead on mityaev, while baronian and evans sat 6 minutes back. jon albon in the lead in la palma’s high country."
"from there, gaps quickly grew with stout at 8.5 minutes, manole at 18 minutes, andmanuel anguita(spain) at 19.5 minutes back in sixth through eighth as the only other runners within 20 minutes of the lead. not long after el reventón, jones quickly fell behind the lead pack to eventually finish in 17th. the colossal 8,000-foot, 11-mile descent down to the seaside town of tazacorte saw two of the previous top five runners fall back, while three held their position or moved up. albon hit the ocean with the same 4.5-minute lead he had an hour and a half earlier high atop the island. ah, but evans made up 90 seconds to move into second along with teammate mityaev over the descent. dmitry mityaev and tom evans running together in second late in the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon. at the same time, small fell into fourth at 8.5 minutes off the lead. from there, there was a substantial gap back to the next runners with manole, stout,pere aurell(spain), and anguita all under 20 minutes off the lead. baronian deployed his parachute on the descent and ended it in ninth, more than 30 minutes off the front. as the men made their way into the city center of los llanos de aridane, jon albon held on to win in 7:03:10. making up 2 minutes on albon over the final 5k climb, teammates dmitry mityaev and tom evans finished hand in hand, tying in 7:05:16. although he lost some time on the descent, jeshurun small ran strong over the final kilometers to take fourth in 7:10:54. ionel manole threw down a furious final sprint to beat out ben stout and hold onto fifth by 11 seconds, with the pair finishing in 7:19:21 and 7:19:32, respectively. jeshurun small (center) lined up at the start of the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon. full results. ionel manole (left) and ben stout (right) congratulate one another after a sprint finish for fifth at the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon. despite having a stacked field, the women’s race was dominated already in its early kilometers. by deseadas (17k), ruth croft (new zealand) had a 2.5-minute lead on ida nilsson (sweden, lives in norway), but nilsson was, in turn, nearly 5 minutes in front of the rest of the women’s field. here,azara garcía(spain) andekaterina mityaeva(andorra) ran in third and fourth at 7 minutes off the lead withmarianne hogan(canada) andhannah allgood(u.s.) less than a minute back.keely henninger(u.s.),sunmaya budha(nepal),emilie collomb(italy), andhillary allen(u.s.) were the rest of the top 10 women at 9, 9.5, 10.5, and 13 minutes off the lead. ruth croft running in the lead late in the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon. croft continued to pull away from the field en route to el reventón (31k), where she built a 4.5-minute lead on nilsson. budha held strong to move into third place at 12 minutes off the lead while the rest of the women’s field continued to fall off croft’s furious pace. hogan and garcía ran 13 and 14 minutes off the lead in fourth and fifth, respectively."
"while we don’t have a split for mityaeva at el reventón, she was sixth at the aid stations before and after that location. and then nilsson dropped the hammer with a tremendous surge to catch croft before el roque de los muchachos at 51k. at the same time, the lead duo continued to build time on the rest of the women’s field. budha continued to run in third at the high point at 15 minutes off the front. at the same time, allgood had run her way up into fourth roughly 24 minutes off the front with hogan holding onto fifth at 28 minutes off the lead. ida nilsson (right) briefly leading ruth croft at the race’s high point. for perspective on just how well croft and nilsson were running up front through 51k, the sixth through ninth women at 50k were mityaeva,katharina hartmuth(germany), garcía, and henninger, all of whom have world-class ultrarunning resumes and yet ran from 32 to 47 minutes off the leaders. wow! of croft and nilsson, it was croft who had the downhill legs on the day. the kiwi put 8 minutes on the swede over the 8,000 feet and just over 90 minutes of descending to the ocean. budha held her own on the descent, actually gaining a minute on croft, but still sitting in third 14 minutes off the lead. at that point, the women’s podium seemed set with just 5k to go. still, only 6 minutes separated the women in fourth through sixth. mityaeva had made up ground on the descent to move into fourth at 34 minutes off the front. allgood and hogan raced in fifth and sixth, at 2 and 6 minutes behind mityaeva. ruth croft continued her phenomenal run to the finish, coming across the line in a women’s course record time of 8:02:49, lowering ida nilsson’s time of 8:04:16 from 2017. ida nilsson rolled into the finish to take second in 8:16:32. sunmaya budha continued to close in on nilsson, but ultimately finished in third in 8:20:31. ekaterina mityaeva held onto fourth in 8:40:59, while hannah allgood finished in fifth in 8:43:23. sunmaya budha running in third late in the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon. full results. ruth croft celebrating her win at the 2024 transvulcania ultramarathon. related articles:"
"with the 2024 cocodona 250 mile frontrunners having crossed the finish line in flagstaff, arizona,rachel entrekinandharry subertasare winners of the women’s and men’s races. both prevailed through truly dramatic and fascinating race stories. the race began at 5 a.m. local time on monday, may 6, and concludes on saturday, may 11. this edition marked the race’s fourth running. the point-to-point route begins in black canyon city and finishes in flagstaff. the course changes from year to year, but this year’s course is said to be 249.4 miles long with roughly 40,000 feet of climbing and 35,000 feet of descending. on the course, runners experience the diversity of arizona’s terrain and climate. in the low desert, runnable singletrack and doubletrack give runners terrain simplicity, but that’s complicated by heat and lack of shade from the sun. the course also visits a couple of mountain ranges, which provide shade and cool temperatures but can bring the challenges of altitude, significant elevation gain and loss, and more technical terrain. it looks like rachel entrekin stopped to smell the flowers on her way to winning the 2024 cocodona 250 mile. photo: howie stern a 250-mile-long race offers nearly infinite logistical challenges, with runners needing to stay on point with hydration and fueling, sleep and other forms of rest, gear management, foot care, and so much more. while the course has changed significantly in most previous years, the records for the current course aresarah ostaszewskifor the women at 72 hours, 50 minutes, and 27 seconds, and 69:41:31 for the men bymichael mcknight, both run in 2023, the only time a substantially similar course was used. with all these variables, the cocodona 250 mile was sure to deliver surprises for all runners, including those at the front of the race. rachel entrekin, an ultrarunner since at least 2013, championed the women’s race. after running for most of the distance in second place, entrekin took over the women’s race leadership late to secure the win. this followed longtime women’s race leadermika thewes’sudden — lengthy, but temporary — stop around mile 233. the men’s race came down to the wire betweenharry subertasandjeff browning. browning, a veteran of at least 150 ultras, led for most of the race. subertas, winner of the 2022 tahoe 200 mile, started the race more conservatively. subertas’ smart pacing allowed him to pass browning to take over the lead with just a few miles to go — in a 250-mile race — to win and set a new course record. runners continued to trickle over the finish line at the time of this article’s publishing, ahead of the 125-hour time limit. read on for more of the race story. phew, what a women’s race.rachel entrekintook over the race leadership late to win after longtime race leadermika thewessuddenly stopped during the third night of racing, around mile 233. entrekin has won several 48-hour races, including most recently the 2023 across the years 48 hour, where she finished with 212 miles. she’s also a 100-mile specialist, as ultrasignup shows she’s won at least eight 100 milers."
"but let’s back up to the race start. when the women settled into the early miles of racing on monday morning, mika thewes, who has no less than twelve 200-plus-mile race finishes, including two cocodona finishes, with a third place in 2023 and a fourth in 2021, ran as the race leader. over the course of that first day, other top women’s runners, entrekin,aliza lapierre, andliz canty, closely chased. during night 1, however, entrekin passed thewes to assume the women’s lead. as of mid-morning on tuesday, around 26 hours into the race, thewes trailed in second place by about two miles, and lapierre was the third woman. rachel entrekin en route to the 2024 cocodona 250 mile win. photo: howie stern around 32 hours into the race, on the afternoon of day 2, thewes retook the women’s lead, which she would hold for over 100 miles. the pass happened at the jerome aid station, mile 126 — the race’s halfway point mileage-wise — when entrekin arrived first, and thewes arrived second, but thewes left first while entrekin stayed in the aid station for a couple of hours, likely to take a nap. at this midway point mileage-wise, lapierre maintained third position, despite sharing with the race organization that she was having a rough race thus far. the brazilian living in spain,manu vilasecaran a couple of miles behind lapierre in fourth place, looking like she had the potential to move up in the rankings. as night 2 arrived, thewes opened her lead on the women’s field to seven miles, while entrekin and lapierre continued to occupy positions two and three. by daybreak on wednesday morning, the race’s 48-hour mark, thewes passed mile 175 and had increased her lead to about 9.5 miles. entrekin ran in second, while, overnight, vilaseca assumed the women’s third-place position and was now running right behind entrekin. during the day on wednesday, thewes increased her lead by a lot. when the race hit 60 hours elapsed on wednesday evening, thewes was just under 220 miles into the race with a nearly 20-mile lead. behind thewes, vilaseca and entrekin were locked in a close duel all day wednesday, vying for second and third places. coming up on wednesday night and 60 hours elapsed, vilaseca put some distance between her and entrekin, running 2.5 miles ahead of her. manu vilaseca took second at the 2024 cocodona 250 mile. photo: howie stern but this trio still had a fair bit of real estate to cover, and anything can — and did — happen. overnight on night 3, the landscape of the women’s race totally changed. entrekin passed vilaseca to take over second place once again. then, around mile 233, thewes suddenly stopped, and it was thought that she’d dropped from the race. entrekin assumed the women’s race lead, which put vilaseca in second place.kylee drugan-eppichmoved up into third position."
"in the soft light after dawn on thursday morning, rachel entrekin smoothly ran into downtown flagstaff, to win the 2024 cocodona 250 mile in 73:31:25. at the finish, she took a seat, shook her head, and said, “so easy.” manu vilaseca took second in 78:04:35. vilaseca has a big ultra resume dating back to before 2011. her top races in recent years have included a win at the 2022 bryce canyon 100 mile and 5th place at the 2019 tds. it looks like this is her first finish of a 200-plus-mile race. against all odds, at around the 77-hour mark, mid-morning on thursday, the race organization shared on the event livestream that thewes had stopped in the night due to an injury from a fall, sought medical attention, and was cleared by both medical and the race organization to restart the race where she’d stopped. so, roughly 12 hours after stopping, she rejoined the race, assuming third place, with drugan-eppich moving back to fourth position. mika thewes finished third, for a second year in a row, in 79:30:12, with some super-fast final miles. kylee drugan-eppich was the fourth woman in80:04:55, looking fresh and strong during her run to the finish line through the streets of flagstaff. this looks to be drugan-eppich’s first 200-plus-mile race, and it also looks like she has just one 100-mile finish to her name, a win of the 2022 zion 100 mile. carrie hendersonwas the fifth woman to finish in 83:37:40. this looks to be henderson’s second cocodona finish; she was sixth place in 2022. full results. talk about a closing effort:harry subertaswon the 2024 cocodona 250 mile men’s race by taking over the lead in the race’s final miles to set a new course record. here are the dynamics of how this played out. from the starting line on monday in black canyon city,joe mcconaughytook the men’s race out, leading for much of the first day and night. mcconaughy was the 2022 cocodona champion, and he holds the current men’s supported fastest known time on the 817-mile arizona trail. trailing mcconaughy throughout the first day of running were top menjeff browning,arlen glick,michael versteeg,jeff garmire,michael mcknight, and others. overnight monday night, on the first night of the race, browning overtook first-day leader mcconaughy to assume the lead of the men’s race. and as night turned to sunrise on tuesday, and the race clock ticked past 24 hours, browning had built an approximately five-mile lead. browning maintained the same approximate gap on second place during day 2, passing the 150-mile mark with roughly a four-mile lead. around midafternoon on day 2, some 33 hours in, mcconaughy ran as second man, and glick in third place, only a few miles apart from each other. however, very close to glick were versteeg andharry subertas, the latter looking super fresh and like he could move up after a more conservative first day and a half of racing."
"harry subertas won the 2024 cocodona 250 mile via a come-from-behind performance where he only took over the race lead with a few miles left in the race. photo: howie stern when the sun set on day 2, browning’s gap on second place mcconaughy was roughly three miles. by now subertas had moved up to third position. at sunrise on wednesday, as the race clock ticked past 48 hours, browning passed the race’s 200-mile mark. overnight, he maintained his lead by about four miles. subertas, meanwhile, continued to move up, assuming second place, with mcconaughy now in third at around nine miles back of second. glick was now in fourth, just behind mcconaughy. during the third day of racing, on wednesday, browning’s lead shrunk rapidly as subertas in second inched closer. at the final aid station, at mile 242, subertas was only about 17 minutes in arrears. then, less than an hour later, when the duo came off the final descent for the final three-mile run from the outskirts of flagstaff to its downtown finish, subertas led by roughly five minutes, running at a solid clip, while browning looked to be walking it in. jeff browning is all smiles after finishing second at the 2024 cocodona 250 mile. photo: howie stern harry subertas arrived to the finish line in flagstaff, arizona, the men’s 2024 cocodona 250 mile champion, setting a new course record in 59 hours, 50 minutes, and 55 seconds. jeff browning took a super solid second, finishing in 60:19:57, just under 30 minutes behind the winner. glick made fast work of day 3, moving solidly into third position. at mile 235, he was four miles behind second place, and seven miles ahead of fourth place. steady forward movement would ensure him the final men’s podium spot, and that’s exactly what he did. when all was said and done, arlen glick took third, in his first 200-plus-mile race, in61:46:57. in the evening hours of night 3, joe mcconaughy, the 2022 cocodona champion, finished in fourth place in 64:03:02. inaugural 2021 cocodona champion, michael versteeg, took fifth in 65:45:20. full results. related articles:"
"at the 2024canyons by utmb 100k,rod farvardhad a breakout performance to win the men’s race andkatie schide(u.s., lives in france) ran an absolute stormer to win for the women. while this year marked the event’s 10th edition, if there’s anything we’ve grown to understand, change is constant at this race. with significant course changes in many editions, this year was no different. starting at china wall, a trailhead located in the mid-foothills of the sierra nevada, the race traveled roughly east to west — with some deviations — to finish in downtown auburn, california. runners traveled an overall downhill trending course, still with over 12,000 feet of climbing over the course of 63 miles. a chunk of the middle of the course traversed the famous western states trail, and included some of its iconic parts, such as the devil’s thumb climb, a stiff climb that finishes passing a thumb-looking rock; the deadwood cemetary, a historic cemetery; and cal street, an almost-20-mile, mostly downhill, and mostly a gloriously runnable piece of real estate. the men’s leaders in the early going of the 2024 canyons by utmb 100k. photo: utmb/howie stern the race started at 5 a.m. local time on saturday, april 27, under clear skies, with mild temperatures and relatively dry air predicted all day. this was perhaps a welcome reprieve for runners, as the region had seen significant rainfall in the prior days. this race held lots of competitive appeal in that it was the last western states 100 golden ticket race ahead of the 2024 event, where the two women and men would earn entry into the race. the event was also a utmb world series major, meaning the top 10 men and women secured entry into the ccc at the utmb world series finals, which will be held this august in chamonix, france. the men’s race went out en masse, with around 20 men within 2 minutes of each other at the first aid station at deadwood 1 (16k). leading this loose pack werepetter engdahl(sweden, lives in norway),rod farvard, andadam peterman. by deadwood 2 (29k), the second aid station, engdahl and farvard still led together, again with a long line of men trailing tightly, at least 10 of them within 2 minutes, including peterman. engdahl and peterman were running on strong comeback stories, with engdahl having suffered broken bones with surgery last fall in a bike crash, and peterman returning after at least a year off due to serious injury. each would avenge these career complications with finishes today, engdahl on the podium and peterman in 13th. and farvard, like so many men, was hunting one of those western states 100 golden tickets; with 3 prior attempts at that race, he’d only topped out as high as 11th place, clearly less than his potential. among the early near leaders through the first 30k also includedstephen kersh,tracen knopp,preston cates, anddrew holmen. michigan bluff (38k) saw some more of the same, with engdahl and kersh leading the train and most of the same men following very closely."
"though there were some 6 men right there, farvard technically beeped into the checkpoint in third place. the village of foresthill, 48k into the race, marked something of a transition point in the race where the runners head out of the race’s higher country, and down to the lowest terrain of the sierra nevada. the competition was also transitional in foresthill as it was here where eventual men’s champ farvard arrived in the lead in 4:13:43, with kersh about 20 seconds back. another 2 minutes brought men’s second and third place, holmen and engdahl. from there on, farvard would not yield the lead. at 61k, the cal 2 aid station, he passed at 5:16:19 elapsed. this time kersh checked in a little over a minute back. here, holmen was holding in third, 2 minutes off second, andmakai clemonshad now moved into fourth position, another 2 minutes back from third place. but it was still any man’s race, with a spread of less than 13 minutes between first and ninth places. at driver’s flat (76k), farvard held tight to his small but solid lead, passing through in 6:33:33. this time, holmen had moved into second place, 3 minutes behind the lead. kersh was right there, though, 30 seconds off holmen. for the race’s final quarter, farvard added bits of distance between he and second place, passing through the final two aid stations, mammoth bar (88k) and confluence (94k), with respective 5- and 7-minute leads. rod farvard looked totally elated to cross the finish line, winning the men’s race in 8:44:30. he gladly accepted the western states 100 golden ticket. rod farvard winning the 2024 canyons by utmb 100k. photo: utmb/howie stern behind him, holmen ran a super steady last 25k, and built a meaningful enough gap on the rest of the field, passing through the 88k and 94k aid stations some 6 and 4 minutes ahead of third place, respectively. when drew holmen crossed the line to take second in 8:51:09, he tossed his pack and collapsed to the ground, clearly using most of what he had in him for that performance. after some finish-line contemplation, holmen declined the golden ticket, which meant it would roll down to third place. but who would be the third-place finisher? as we know, ultimately, engdahl. after sitting in fifth place as late as 88k, he surged to move up two spots when he passed the 94k aid station. petter engdahl’s excellent ultra pacing led him to take third in 8:55:31. he was eager to claim the second men’s western states golden ticket. having run a hugely consistent race, makai clemens finished fourth in 8:57:38. stephen kersh, after pushing the men’s race pace earlier, found himself in fifth at 9:05:56. full results. the 2024 canyons by utmb 100k men’s podium (left to right): 2. drew holmen, 1. rod farvard, 3. petter engdahl. photo: utmb/jacob banta the start of the women’s race couldn’t have played out more differently from the men’s.katie schide(u.s., lives in france) took the women’s race out, created a gap early, and ran on."
"by the first aid station at deadwood 1 (16k), schide had already built a gap on the field, some 2.5 minutes. she grew that gap by the second aid point at deadwood 2 (29k) to nearly 9.5 minutes. schide, with too many accolades to mention, wassecond at last year’s western states 100and has her eyes on the prize of that race this year. undoubtedly, this race was a critical step in her preparations for this year’s edition. emkay sullivanwas a women’s pace pusher over the first 30k, running around schide early on, assuming the second position after that, and never looking back. sullivan has loads of strong trail race performances to her name, with all of them at shorter distances than this one. mary denholmfeatured prominently in podium position over the first 30k, having passed through the 16k and 29k aid stations in podium position. denholm is a 2-time olympic marathon trials qualifier with a 2:36:28 marathon pr, who was basically debuting in trail racing. also among the mix for the women over the first 30k wereaddie bracyas well as australiansanna mckennaandstephanie auston. by michigan bluff (39k), schide led by about 11 minutes. sullivan remained schide’s closest chaser, with denholm in third place, just under 13 minutes off the lead. ten kilometers later, at foresthill (49k), the schide show was officially in full force, with her arriving at 4:25:14 and with more than 21 minutes of real estate to the next woman. sullivan and denholm maintained their second- and third-place positions, around 2 minutes apart from each other. behind denholm was also some decent daylight, with fourth-place bracy coming through about 10.5 minutes after third place. schide was truly ablaze at cal 2, the 61k, some two-thirds of the way down cal street, running through in 5:31:21. there, she’d also cracked the overall top 10. due to a lack of women’s coverage in the live stream as well as issues with sullivan’s tracking devices, we don’t have her split at cal 2, but she was in second place here. denholm was the next woman through in third, 65 minutes off the lead. at driver’s flat (76k), schide was now picking her way through the men’s top 10, passing in sixth overall in 6:50:38. for the record, that’s 17 minutes back from the men’s leader three-quarters of the way through a trail 100k — some insane running. schide’s lead in the women’s race would only grow over the race’s final quarter, and she remained in sixth place overall at the finish line. at mammoth bar (88k) and confluence (94k), she led by 44 and 46 minutes respectively. ultimately, katie schide was the runaway women’s victor in 9:10:10. it’s safe to say that things are looking really good for schide’s second attempt at the western states 100 this summer. with her automatic entry based on her top-10 finish last year, the two western states 100 golden tickets would roll down to other women. katie schide winning the 2024 canyons by utmb 100k. photo: utmb/howie stern sullivan’s race for second place never wavered."
"at 88k and 94k, she held a respective 7- and 9-minute gap over third place. emkay sullivan cruised over the finish line to take second in 10:01:26. while she cautiously accepted the western states 100 golden ticket at the finish line, she later decided to not officially accept it, which meant it would roll down to another woman. behind schide and sullivan, the race for the women’s top 10 was anything but set in the race’s final 25k. denholm, the debut trail racer, ran into problems en route to driver’s flat (76k), relinquishing her podium position. at the time of this article’s publishing, she’s not showing an official dnf, but she certainly has. as the women’s positions fluctuated, it would beanna louden (née kascius)who emerged into the third position by 88k and who would hold it until she finished in 10:24:37. kacius has about 3 years of ultrarunning under her belt, with top finishes including seventh at the 2022 iau 100k world championships, and fourth at the 2023 black canyon 100k. she narrowly missed a golden ticket by one position at that latter event. this time, she was golden, graciously accepting that western states 100 entry. careth arnoldfinished fourth in 10:38:42, after moving up into that spot before the 94k aid station. when the second western states 100 golden ticket rolled down to her post-race, she accepted it. anna mckenna rounded out the women’s top 5, crossing the line in 10:43:31. emkay sullivan taking second at the 2024 canyons by utmb 100k. photo: utmb/howie stern full results. the 2024 canyons by utmb 100k women’s podium (left to right): 2. emkay sullivan, 1. katie schide, 3. anna louden (née kascius). photo: utmb/jacob banta related articles:"

"after a week of racing, the 2024marathon des sables legendarystage race has concluded in morocco’s sahara desert.rachid el morabityandaziza el amranytook home victory for the host country in the men’s and women’s races. for el morabity, it was his 10th win of the event, and for el amrany, her first. the seven-day, self-sufficiency stage race is often identified as one of the hardest footraces in the world. throughout the race, runners navigate dunes, climb jebels (mountains), and run across a multitude of surfaces in an attempt to make it to the finish line. runners carry a backpack of self-sufficiency, containing the food and camping gear needed for the week; the race organization provides only a shade tent and water. each of the race’s six stages offers a unique challenge and no one is guaranteed to make it to the end, not even those in the elite field. the race bivouac before the 2024 marathon des sables legendary. photo: mds/ian corless the 2024 race started on sunday, april 14, and concluded on saturday, april 20. this year’s 252.8-kilometer (157 miles) course was divided into the following six stages: this year was set to be a fast one. the temperature at the start of the race was a moderate 18 degrees celsius (65 fahrenheit), making it cool compared to previous years and easier for athletes to make a quick getaway on the fairly easy first day. however, as the week went on, temperatures rose to the extreme, along with wind and sandstorms, too. in the men’s race, eyes were turned to the moroccan el morabity brothers — older brother rachid and younger brothermohamed el morabity— who were favorites leading up to the event. morocco’saziza rajiwas the favorite in the women’s field, having won the race in 2021. but morocco’s aziza el amrany, with two previous podium finishes over the last two years, was sure to challenge. the early going of stage 1 in the 2024 marathon des sables legendary. photo: mds/ian corless the competition was set during a big year of change for the longtime race, with this year being the event’s 38th edition. iconic race founderpatrick bauerpassed the reigns tocyril gauthier, operator of the half marathon des sables events. through this, the week-long stage race took an evolved name, the marathon des sables legendary. additionally, logistical shake-ups abound for runners on the ground, namely the shift of the notorious long stage to stage 3 rather than stage 4. also, the final stage 6 has been for some years a non-competitive charity stage, but this year it was timed and a part of the overall competition. read on for how the race played out. ahead of the race, all eyes were turned to nine-time marathon des sables winnerrachid el morabityof morocco, as well as his brothermohamed el morabity(morocco), a six-time finisher with one win and five second places to his name. rachid made a strong start to stage 1, dashing off at an average pace of 18 kilometers per hour, testing the rest of the competition to see if they would keep up."
"by halfway through the first stage, rachid slowed when his brothermohamed el morabity(morocco) andaziz yachou(morocco) were the only athletes close behind. at the end of stage 1, it was the younger brother mohamed in the lead, winning the stage in 2:11:09, followed by rachid (2:11:36) and aziz (2:11:38). in fourth, it was fellow moroccan and older brother of aziz,hamid yachou, withahmed ouikhalfenalso of morocco in fifth. mohamed el morabity winning stage 1 of the 2024 marathon des sables legendary. photo: mds/antonio miranda stage 2 remained steady throughout, with the top three men — mohamed, rachid, and aziz — running together before crossing the finish line hand in hand ahead of the race’s longest stage the next day. the three race leaders running together in stage 2. photo: mds/antonio miranda now for the big one: stage 3. this was the longest stage, with 85.3 kilometers (53 miles). it takes place over two days with a 35-hour cut-off time. usually, during the long stage, we see the leaders create a gap with their competitors, just as mohamed did this year. he started competitively and got better as the day unfolded. after 25 kilometers, mohamed accelerated ahead of his competition through the stage’s technical sections. by the end of the stage, mohamed had a lead of over 10 kilometers, finishing in 7:37:47. but the stage 3 race wasn’t over. behind mohamed, his brother rachid battled it out with aziz. right until the last moment, the pair were head to head. with 200 meters to go rachid launched a sprint, but aziz’s speed couldn’t be matched. aziz crossed the line at 8:31:52, just one second before rachid. there was also a surprise entrance fromyoann stuckof france, who finished just seven minutes behind rachid and aziz, overtaking hamid for fourth in the stage. yoann stuck running a stage in the 2024 marathon des sables legendary. photo: mds/ian corless in an attempt to reclaim overall fourth place, hamid raced ahead during the start of stage 4 but was caught by the el morabity brothers after the first sandy section. despite his efforts, he was eventually overtaken by stuck, who hung onto fourth place for the stage, beating hamid by a mere second. further ahead, rachid broke away from his brother mohamed and aziz by the 30-kilometer mark, winning the stage and solidifying his overall second-place position ahead of aziz in the overall standings. mohamed and aziz would finish together 95 seconds behind rachid. there was a dramatic turn of events during stage 5. mohamed started the stage with a 53-minute overall lead but started slowing by 10 kilometers into the 31-kilometer stage, slowed greatly by 20 kilometers, and stepped out of the third checkpoint with a bandage around his thigh. he limped over the finish line in 35th position. this opened up the field for rachid and aziz, who now both had a chance to claim first place. rachid accelerated to the finish line, 40 seconds ahead of aziz and, just as importantly, more than 52 minutes ahead of mohamed."
"the top three remained unchanged at the end of the day, but the overall competition was very tight among them heading into the race’s final stage, with mohamed 35 seconds ahead of rachid and 2 minutes and 51 seconds ahead of aziz. rachid el morabity on his way to winning stage 5. photo: mds/ian corless the battle for first place continued into the sixth and final stage, with the top three runners remaining fairly tight throughout the 21-kilometer stage. in the end, rachid and aziz went head to head. with another sprint finish, rachid el morabity took a two-second lead and won the stage with a time of 1:22:05 and an overall winning time of 20:42:19, for his 10th overall victory at the race. rachid now stands with only one other runner to have won the race 10 times, morocco’slahcen ahansal. right behind was aziz yachou who crossed the line in 1:22:07 and finished third overall with a time of 20:44:37. this was aziz’s fourth finish, and he’s never finished slower than fourth place. mohamed el morabity retained third in this stage, crossing the line a minute later than his brother in 1:23:05 and taking second overall in 20:42:44 — his sixth time finishing second and his seventh finish of the event. full results. the hardest working men of the marathon des sables: the local staff. photo: mds/ian corless there was no holding back at the start of the women’s race either. morocco’saziza el amranyled with an average pace of 14 kilometers per hour, far ahead of the competition. although she slowed down during the second half of stage 1, el amrany still finished way ahead in a time of 2:45:54 and 17th overall. one of the favorites for this year’s competition,aziza raji(morocco) was the 2021 winner and has placed in the top 10 in all five marathon des sables that she’s completed. raji came in 26 minutes behind el amrany and took second place for stage 1. she was closely followed byadriana moserof the netherlands in third place, a first-timer who won the most recent half marathon des sables. multi-time podium finishergemma game(u.k.) and three-time winnerlaurence klein(france) followed in fourth and fifth. aziza el amrany winning stage 1 of the 2024 marathon des sables legendary. photo: mds/antonio miranda stage 2 took a surprising start as klein tried to lead but was quickly caught by el amrany, who went on to win the second stage. at the end of day two, the overall podium remained the same with el amrany holding a 46-minute total lead. things remained stable on the podium for the third stage of the women’s race. there was speculation as to whether el amrany would be able to hold her position on this, the longest stage, after two strong days. however, there was no doubt in the end, as she once again dominated most of the stage, besting raji by 38 minutes and moser by 78 minutes. leading frenchwoman klein suffered a blow around 30 kilometers."

"fun runs consist of completing three laps of the course in 40 hours, and finishing this is considered a proper achievement in itself. then she became the first woman ever to complete the fourth lap and set out for her fifth. and ultimately, she returned to the yellow gate at the race’s start-finish line triumphant, as the fifth and final finisher for 2024. meanwhile, on the men’s side, a mix of prior barkley finishers, near finishers, and hopefuls got a record-breaking six men out on the final lap. after leading for much of the race’s second half, and getting the choice of direction for the final lap, verys was the first one back to the yellow gate in a time of 58:44:59, an amazing run for a barkley first-timer. kelly came in next with a time of 59:15:38, his third finish of the event, and campbell finished for an incredible fourth time in 59:30:32. the fourth finisher, hamilton, reached the finish in 59:38:42. whether it was good weather, an ever-increasing amount of course knowledge, or an incredibly strong field, the 2024 edition’s runners set a variety of additional records. this included a record for the number of finishers of the event in a single year, up from last year’s three, and brought the total number of people to complete the course to 20. this also includes a record 12 barkley participants who finished fun runs this year, up from 10 in 2023. read more about how the women’s and men’s races played out below. it was a historic moment at 5:16 p.m. on friday, march 22, under two minutes before the race’s 60-hour cutoff, at frozen head state park whenjasmin paris(u.k.) became the first woman to complete the barkley marathons in a time of 59:58:21. and while during the initial hours of the event, it seemed like she was well on pace to complete the event, it came down those final 99 seconds. early reports from the ground were spotty. with the entrants list of barkley kept secret, and only some runners having outed themselves as heading to tennessee for the event, details of how the early laps of the race played out were kept under wraps. it wasn’t until she completed the second lap of the course that keith dunn confirmed paris as a participant. with paris’ return to the barkley for her third attempt this year, many believed this could be the chance for a woman to finish all five laps of the course. paris finished the three-lap fun run in her initial attempt at the race in 2022. at the time, she was best known for winning the 268-mile winter spine race outright in 2019 with a time of 83:12:23, a record that stood until 2024. jasmin paris, the first ever woman finisher of the barkley marathons at the event’s 2024 edition, with now four-time finisher jared campbell. photo: howie stern paris returned to barkley in 2023, finished another fun run, and became only the second woman to start lap four."

"while dunn tweeted that early on that laz said, “the theme for the first loop this year is that you have to be able to navigate for yourself,” groups stayed together, and a group of five came in off of loop two together, including kelly, hall,sébastien raichon(france), and verys in 19:27:49. it’s worth noting they were joined by two-time fun run finisher jasmin paris. a brief 17-minute stop saw the first racers heading out for lap three. meanwhile,greig hamilton(new zealand), campbell, andmaxime gauduin(france) finished their second loop in 19:52:36.albert herrero(spain) and sanchez followed at 20:26:04, and ihara andthomas dunkerbeck(the netherlands) came in together at 22:08:53. the brutal course continued to take its toll on racers with multi-time big dog’s backyard ultra winner and record-holder lewis dropping on his second loop. sanchez tapped out on lap three saying, “i don’t know how i did that last year.” ihor verys wins the 2024 barkley marathons on his first attempt. photo: howie stern the leaders marched on with verys finishing loop three in 31:31:47. he was followed by kelly and hall just five minutes back in 31:36:57. hamilton, campbell, raichon, herrero, gauduin, and ihara all came in to complete loop three over the course of the next five hours and headed out for number four. when you add jasmin paris in the women’s race, who was firmly in the mix, it made it a record-breaking 10 runners out on lap four. but as all barkley runners and fans know, starting four laps does not always guarantee a finish, and gauduin, ihara, and herrero all dropped during this loop. in rapid succession, between 45:46 and 46:19, some five men finished loop four, in order kelly, verys, hamilton, hall, and campbell. verys returned to the course first, after about a 20-minute break, choosing the clockwise direction for his fifth and final lap. it was only a matter of minutes until all the other men trailed out, in opposite directions of each other. after a small time gap, raichon was the last to finish loop four, nabbing a time of 47:45:39. dunn reported he took a wrong turn toward the end of the loop and had to go back out to correct it before receiving credit for the lap. with a quick turnaround in camp, raichon made it back onto the course to start the fifth lap just three minutes before the cutoff to do so at 48 hours elapsed. including paris in the women’s race, that made seven folks on the course for five laps, a record number of loop-five starters. a lot of anxious waiting among ultrarunning fans in frozen head state park and the world over followed for the race’s final 12 hours."

"at the 2023iau 24-hour world championshipsin taipei,miho nakata(japan) set anew women’s world recordandaleksandr sorokin(lithuania) repeated his win from 2019. nakata covered a distance of 167.996 miles (270.363 kilometers) and sorokin ran 187.530 miles (301.800 kilometers). this year’s race, held on a 1.24-mile (2 kilometers) loop, took place on friday and saturday, december 1 and 2, and kicked off at 10 a.m. local time on friday. the iau 24-hour world championships are one of the biggest events in ultrarunning and haven’t been held since 2019 due to covid-19 restrictions. unlike many other races, athletes are not only competing as individuals but are also working to score points as a team for their country’s team rankings. in the women’s race, expectations were high for the last edition’s winner and 24-hour record holdercamille herron(united states), but in the end it was nakata who stole the show and broke herron’s world record by a super-slim margin of 807 feet (246 meters), what amounts to a little over half a lap of a track. in the men’s race, as predicted by many, sorokin emerged as champion after creating a large gap between himself and the rest of the field. while sorokin was aiming to also set a world record, he wasn’t able to maintain the requisite pace in the last 5 or so hours, though he still finished first by a wide margin. we dive deeper into the race below. japan’s miho nakata celebrates after setting a new women’s 24-hour world record at the 2023 iau 24-hour world championships in taipei on december 1 and 2. photo: international association of ultrarunners as expected, the top athletes remained close to one another in the early couple hours of the race, and then things began to string out. by some five hours in, herron, the 2019 champion and world-record holder, sat in third place, two minutes back from the lead, while eventual championmiho nakata(japan) was already leading. at the halfway point, the women’s podium positions were composed of nakata, herron, andline caliskaner(norway). some 16 hours in, nakata continued to build her lead, but second and third places shuffled, withcarmen maria perez(spain) andnoora honkala(finland) now in those spots. one of the biggest shocks of the women’s race came when herron withdrew at about 88 miles (142k), just under 12 hours into the event. only nine weeks prior, herron won and broke the course record at the spartathlon in greece and said on social media after withdrawing that she didn’t feel fully recovered from that effort. change came again at the 21-hour mark behind leader nakata, whereolena shevchenko(ukraine) had now moved up to second place and perez down to third place. as the race progressed, all eyes were on nakata, who was on track for breaking the world record, but the question was if she’d be able to hold pace through the finish. she needed every last second of those 24 hours to get the job done, surpassing the prior world record by a short distance. read more about nakata’s world record in ournews article."

"after a day of fierce heat and competition, the 2023ultra-trail cape town 100kcrowneddmitry mityaev(russia) andruth croft(new zealand) as this year’s champions. the race started at 6 a.m. local time in cape town, south africa, on saturday, november 25. the 98-kilometer (61 miles) race is one of several that took place during the weekend festival. it is unique in its landscape, with mountains, beaches, and cityscapes throughout the ultra. the race began at gardens rugby football club and covered 4,972 meters (16,312 feet) of elevation gain. the route is front loaded in its climbing, with 1,700 meters of gain in the first 25k, scaling table mountain and suther peak. race day was a hot one, with athletes drinking as much water as possible on route and at the checkpoints. at the checkpoints, race crews poured ice cubes in athletes’ packs and placed socks filled with ice across their necks to stop the athlete’s body temperature from rising in the midday heat. the race was set to be an exciting one, with last year’s men’s champion mityaev returning to compete against favorites such asthibaut baronian(france). unfortunately,tom evans(u.k.), one of the men’s favorites, was missing from the start line after being held at knifepoint in cape town while training for the race. however, that didn’t stop him from cheering his adidas terrex teammates during the event. the women’s race appeared to be just as dramatic, withmarianne hogan(canada) competing in her second go at this event, after having taken second two years ago. however, she was a bit of a wild card given she’s been returning from injury. all things told, international superstar croft was probably the women’s favorite. read on for the full race story. dmitry mityaev on his way to winning the 2023 ultra-trail cape town 100k. photo: irunfar/neville sharwood dmitry mityaev’s(russia) running career has gone from strength to strength in recent years, after running the fastest time ever in the mountain race at mount elbrus and winning this event last year, he was always going to be one of the strongest contenders. right from the beginning mityaev dominated, staying at the front of the pack up to the first checkpoint until he decided to break away and run alone for the rest of the race, and he never stopped. between table mountain at 31k and llandudno 41k, it appeared that mityaev had taken a fall with a nasty gash on his left thigh. this was followed by a wrong turn after hopping from the roads and onto trails just before the llandudno checkpoint. he could be forgiven because the rugged trail looked more like someone’s back garden than a running route. needless to say, none of these setbacks stopped him and mityaev came through the finish line at 10:43:06, 19 minutes ahead of his next opponent. whilst mityaev took the lead, competition was heating up between second, third, and fourth places.caleb olson(u.s.) andthibaut baronian(france) were 10 minutes behind mityaev coming into the checkpoint at llandudno, followed closely byanthony costales(u.s.) anddarren thomas(u.s.)."
"although as predicted olson came in second at hout bay checkpoint at 57k, baronian dropped back to fifth place behind and seemed to be dipping. however, baronian managed to climb back up to fourth position for the remainder of the race until he crossed the finish line. thomas would lose ground later, easing back to finish 10th. whilst mityaev crossed the line in first, the gaps grew larger between the rest of the competitors toward the end of the race. americans filled the rest of the men’s podium, with olson placing second at 11:02:28, followed by costales in 11:24:08. caleb olson crosses the 2023 ultra-trail cape town 100k finish line in second place. photo: irunfar/neville sharwood full results. this year’s winner wasruth croft(new zealand), also the 2022 western states 100 champion. to win this race, croft put in an incredible effort and dominated the women’s race throughout the course. she began head-to-head withmarianne hogan(canada), but after the fourth checkpoint at table mountain, 31k into the race, the gap began to increase between the two athletes. by checkpoint five at llandudno, just 10k later, croft had increased her lead by nine minutes and passed through at 4:55, just a few minutes behindbeth pascall’scourse record pace. however, since pascall’s record, the course has changed, making it harder to compare the course times. as the race progressed, croft became an even stronger athlete and increased her lead. whilst croft appeared to be running her own race at the front, the competition was fierce between hogan andekaterina mityaeva(russia) for second and third place. at table mountain there was a widening gap, with hogan seemingly taking the lead. this was promising for an athlete who was recovering from injury and matching similar times from her performance at this event in 2021 when she placed second. but during the latter half of the race, hogan took a fall on a gravel sidewalk, and after this she was passed by mityaeva who moved in to second place. whilst the battle continued for second and third, croft crossed the finish line to win in 12:12:20. hogan managed to push back and finished in second place at 12:39:53, followed by mityaeva in third in a very close 12:44:07. in doing so, mityaeva improved upon her fourth-place finish at the race last year. ruth croft doing a bit of beach running en route to winning the 2023 ultra-trail cape town 100k. photo: irunfar/neville sharwood full results. marianne hogan would go on to take second at the 2023 ultra-trail cape town 100k. photo: irunfar/neville sharwood related articles:"

"the 2023diagonale des fous, or “diagonal of fools,” kicked off at 9 p.m. local time in saint pierre, on the south coast of réunion island, a french department in the indian ocean, on thursday, october 19. the unique 165-kilometer (102 miles) traverse, the longest race in the weekend-longgrand raid réunionfestival, begins on the south side of the island with a partial ascent of active volcano, piton de la fournaise, and follows a spectacular route through unesco world heritage sites and the lands of réunion national park to finish on the north coast in the capital city of saint-denis. the race takes in roughly 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) of climbing and as much descending, on brutally technical terrain, and is seen as one of the most difficult 100 milers on the global race calendar. this year’s race had a promising line-up, includingutmb’s2022 winner,katie schide, and 2023 third-place mangermain grangier. fans were also thrilled with a surprising late addition — four-time diagonale des fous winnerfrançoisd’haene, who has been absent from the scene for a time due to injury and was spotted on the start line sporting a hand-written bib. while women’s favorite schide did not disappoint, with a commanding win over strong rivals including france’scamille bruyas; it was 2023hardrock 100championaurélien dunand-pallazwho came out on top in the men’s race, with a similar runaway victory to what we saw from him at hardrock. read on to see how both these races played out. katie schidehas had two high profile second-place finishes this season — at thewestern states 100, where the american living in france finished in the second fastest women’s time ever on the historic route, and atocc, where she demonstrated her versatility by stepping down a distance and still competing at the highest level. at diagonale des fous, it was clear from the start that she would be hard to beat — leading from the get-go, and always with a comfortable gap on 2022 les templiers winner,camille bruyas, of france, in second. schide took it out hard from the first climb, and by notre dame de la paix at 28k, already had an 18-minute lead on bruyas. she gained even more ground on the second leg of the climb up to the race’s high point, croisée coteaux kerveguen at 63.5k, where she topped out 29 minutes ahead of her chaser. past the 100k point at ilet à bourse, she had stretched her lead further to an hour and 12 minutes, at this point looking impossible to catch. while schide was out on her own for almost the entirety of the race, so too was bruyas, who always had a big gap on the rest of the field and never looked to be in danger. summiting croisée coteaux kerveguen at 63.5k, she was 23 minutes clear of réunion island’s ownemilie maroteauxin third. it was a closer battle for third position, with germany’seva-maria spergerfollowing hot on maroteaux’s heels, just two minutes behind at that point."
"schide continued her tour de force for the remaining 60k or so of the race — which had fewer big climbs, but covered ankle-breaking volcanic terrain — and ultimately finished in 27:31:08, an hour and 26 minutes clear of bruyas in second. bruyas finished with an even bigger lead on maroteaux in third. after some close running and trading of places with sperger earlier in the race, maroteaux managed to pull away, securing the final podium position and the first local home in the women’s race with another big margin. katie schide, the 2023 diagonale des fous champion. photo: canal grand raid full results. early on in his career, in 2012, frenchmanaurélien dunand-pallazran the 73k race at grand raid réunion, placing fourth. was a seed planted then to come back eventually and take on the 100-mile win? who knows, but he started this race like someone on a mission. by notre dame de la paix — 28k into the race with just over 1,600 meters climbed — he was just over a minute ahead of then second-place, france’sgermain grangier, but was not giving up his marginal lead. reaching coteaux kerveguen at 61k — just before cresting the race’s high point at roughly 2,500 meters — dunand-pallaz had pulled 12 minutes clear of the rest of the field, with his countrymanlambert santellithen following in second. last year’s second-place man, switzerland’sjean-philippe tschumi— after moving around in the top 10 for the first half of the race — crept up the field to second place after 85k. he came close enough to make dunand-pallaz sweat, running just three minutes back of the leader around the 100k mark. tschumi held on to second for a long time, but dunand-pallaz reasserted his dominance, and had pulled more than a half hour clear of his chaser by deux bras at 128k, with most of the climbing done. it was here too that grangier made a move into second position. like tschumi, grangier had been moving around the top 10 for the race’s first half, before settling into third position from 92k onward. it was on the second-to-last climb up to dos d’ane where he finally got ahead of tschumi. dunand-pallaz continued to power ahead, ultimately finishing in 23 hours and 21 minutes, 39 minutes clear of grangier in second. tschumi followed in 24:28 for third, with grangier having put significant time on him in the race’s closing section. grand raid legend, frenchmanfrançoisd’haenemay or may not be back to full race fitness. he was briefly in podium position around the halfway point but fell back a little to ultimately finish in eighth place. mid-race, his social media channels indicated that he was suffering from leg cramps. we hope this is only the start of his comeback. aurélien dunand-pallaz celebrates winning the 2023 diagonale des fous. photo: canal grand raid full results. related articles:"

"the 2023utmbwas filled with question marks about who would end up standing on the top step of the podium, both for the men and women. on the women’s side, only a handful of the top 10 from the 2022 race were returning. if one were to ignore everything thatcourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had previously done this summer, she would have been the odds-on favorite. but just seven weeks removed from setting a new course record at the hardrock 100, which was just three weeks after doing the same at the western states 100, no one knew how her seemingly super-human body and mind would hold up. but really, in hindsight, it was silly for anyone to worry about how the g.o.a.t. of trail ultrarunning would handle a third 100-mile race of her summer. dauwalter once again showed that she is in a league of her own, leading the race from 32 kilometers in and never looking back. her runaway victory resulted in a time of 23:29:14. for the men, with nine out of the top 10 men from 2022 returning, the depth of the field was unquestionable. and with kilian jornet out due to injury, it was anyone’s race. but, truth be told, most eyes were probably trained onjim walmsley(post-race interview). after his second summer spent in europe with a full focus placed on utmb, would he finally be able to put together the race that everyone thought that he could? would there finally be an american man who would crack the code of utmb? it it wasn’t going to be walmsley, could it bezach miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) instead? for much of the race, it would have been difficult to discern which of the two americans, or really any of the men running in the top 10, would come away with the victory as the lead changed hands multiple times and the gaps grew into the double-digit minutes on multiple occasions. but it in the end, it was walmsley, the meticulous student of utmb, who would finally be able to put all the pieces together and reach chamonix first with a time of 19:37:43, a new course record. he becomes the first american man to win this iconic european race. at 172 kilometers (106.5 miles) in length and with some 10,000 meters (32,800) feet of climbing, the utmb circles mont blanc in the alps on one is arguably the most iconic course in trail ultrarunning. with a start in chamonix, france, the final race at the end of a week of all things trail running and racing, the course leaves town and climbs quickly into the mountains into france, italy, and then onto switzerland before returning to chamonix to the biggest finish line in the sport. it’s fair to say that this is the most competitive trail ultramarathon of the year, and the event serves up all the excitement that is expected of it."
"with its high level of prestige as the grand finale of the utmb mont blanc festival, huge crowds come to watch the greats of the sport race over the rugged and wild course where anything can, and does, happen. the field heads off from chamonix, france, for a long run in the mountains in the 2023 utmb. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein this year, 2,814 starters headed out from chamonix at 6 p.m. on friday, september 1, 2023, on a slightly modified course. late in august, race organizers announced a change in the final segment of the race that added just under two kilometers (about 1.2 miles) to the overall distance but replaced a steep climb and technical descent with much gentler forest running, albeit still a climb. while this change suited some runners and was a disadvantage to others, in the end, it probably made very little difference in the outcome of any of the placings in the race. a special thanks tohokafor making our coverage of utmb possible! thanks also togoodrfor its support of our utmb coverage. was there actually any doubt that americancourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) would actually win utmb? if her performances throughout the summer were any indication, it would have been foolish to bet against her. after winning and setting course records at both western states 100 and hardrock 100 earlier this summer, this win might just be the cherry on the cake, or thecerise sur le gateau, as the french would have it. the legend of the sport led from the early miles, and in typical courtney fashion, seemed to smile and joke her way to the win with a time of 23:29:14. but the win didn’t come as easy as it may have seemed to people watching. while she continued to put on a smile for race volunteers and spectators, dauwalter was deep in the pain cave after about 110 kilometers, sometimes wondering if her legs would actually keep her moving forward, all of the miles from earlier in the summer catching up to her. but luckily, she had just enough left in her to get her to chamonix and the roar of the massive crowds. courtney dauwalter has her eye on the prize at the 2023 utmb start line. irunfar/kirsten kortebein whileemma pooley, of switzerland, led for the initial kilometers of the race, it didn’t take long for dauwalter to move to the front. sporting her trademark smile and happily interacting with volunteers at aid stations whenever the opportunity presented itself, dauwalter simply makes it look good. the top three women, dauwalter, pooley, and france’sblandine l’hirondel(post-race interview), came intoles contamines, 32 kilometers into the race, within seconds of each other. it would be the last time we would see the front of the race together, as bycol du bonhomme,12 kilometers later, the gap between dauwalter and second-placemanon bohardcailler, of france, was nearly 10 minutes. l’hirondel and chiina’sfu-zhao xiang(pre-race interview) came through another two minutes later. germany’skatharina hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) came over the dark col another five minutes in arrears."
"the situation remained essentially unchanged through les chapieux at 51 kilometers and lac combal at 69 kilometers, except the gaps were growing. nearly 10 hours into the race, dauwalter came throughcourmayeur at 81 kilometers, not even bothering to stop at the aid station. bohard continued to keep the gap manageable at 18 minutes, but it was really starting to look like another runaway victory for the american for the top step of the podium. but the race for the rest of the top spots was just starting to get interesting. l’hirondel and xiang remained close in third and fourth, just a few minutes back of bohard, and hartmuth continued to lurk another 20 minutes back. this early in the race, there were still many within striking distance. katharina hartmuth runs through lac combal, 69 kilometers into the 2023 utmb, in the dark of night. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks coming throughrefuge bertone at 86 kilometers, the top five remained unchanged and canada’sailsa mcdonald, poland’skatarzyna solińska, the u.s.’ssabrina stanleyandleah yingling, andclaudia trempsof spain filled out the top 10. somewhere beforearnouvaz at kilometer 99, bohard took a fall that would ultimately take her out of the race. she entered the aid station walking gingerly, but was determined to keep going. this development opened up podium possibilities even further, and xiang and l’hirondel continued to run together at grand col ferret, 50 minutes behind the ever-steady, smiling, and happy dauwalter. hartmuth was just 15 minutes off a podium position. with the arrival of saturday morning came renewed spirits for many. dauwalter arrived to sun atla fouly running 26 minutes under her own course-record pace. l’hirondel and xiang came in just under 50 minutes back, but now there was daylight, in the form of a couple of minutes, between the women. hartmuth remained in fourth, 65 minutes down, solińska in sixth, yingling in seventh, and spain’smaite maioracame through in eighth looking relaxed and focused. stanley remained in the top 10. bohard finally succumbed to injuries from her fall and would withdraw from the race. by la giète, 130 kilometers in, the gap between dauwalter and second place was over an hour, but the fight between the rest of the top five remained tight. xiang moved into second and hartmuth third, just minutes apart, as l’hirondel began to feel the distance and time in her legs and dropped back to fourth place. solińska and macdonald continued in fifth and sixth, running together almost two hours behind dauwalter. courtney dauwalter working hard just before champex lac during the 2023 utmb. photo: irunfar/jaja ferer capili things remained relatively unchanged at trient at 144 kilometers. dauwalter looked good, xiang was 66 minutes back, hartmuth was a mere minute behind her, and l’hirondel following next in fourth. solińska and macdonald followed another 50 minutes back, with maiora trailing them by 15 minutes. with victory seemingly all but assured for the american, the battle for the other two podium spots started to get heated on the closing climbs and kilometers."
"through vallorcine at the base of the final major series of climbs,hartmuth moved up into second after biding her time the entire race, now seven minutes ahead of third-placexiang and fourth-place l’hirondel, a further nine minutes back. maiora led solińska in fifth and sixth just under two hours behind the leader. near the top of the final climb at tête de béchar, 161 kilometers in, it was hartmuth in second, 56 minutes down. l’hirondel moved into third 15 minutes back and xiang kept the pressure on for the final podium spot, trailing by just four minutes. the next gap to maiora remained about 30 minutes. meanwhile, dauwalter made short work of the final descent to the finish line in chamonix, finishing in 23:29:14 and completing the ultimate trifecta of ultrarunning, winning the western states 100, hardrock 100, and utmb all in one year. “anytime you have a chance to take on a crazy challenge, i think we should,” she said afterward. the battle for the final two podium spots didn’t let up until the very end. coming through la floria, just four kilometers from the finish, hartmuth led l’hirondel by a mere nine minutes, and both women looked strong all the way to the finish. they would finish just over 40 minutes behind dauwalter, hartmuth in second at 24:10:52. l’hirondel, the multi-time trail world champion, finished in third at24:22:50 for her debut 100 miler. blandine l’hirondel finished third at her debut 100-mile race, the 2023 utmb nonetheless. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks xiang would fade away from podium contention in the final kilometers but held on for an incredible fourth-place finish, improving on her seventh place in 2022. but really, the excitement of her race finish was only added by receiving a marriage proposal on the finish line. having met her now-fiancé — she said yes! — four years ago at utmb, the proposal really was a perfect ending to her race. maiora finished fifth, an impressive result after her dnf in the race in 2021. pre-race favoritesmartina valmassoi(pre-race interview) of italy andeszter csillag(pre-race interview), a hungarian living in hong kong, withdrew from the race early. the women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. katharina hartmuth, 1. courtney dauwalter, and 3. blandine l’hirondel. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. leah yingling runs through the cheers of crowds in courmayeur during the 2023 utmb. photo: irunfar/jaja ferer capili after a history of struggling with utmb, the american men showed up this year withjim walmsley(post-race interview) andzach miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) taking the top two-spots on the podium. two vastly different racers with different approaches to the event, the two were able to push each other from start to end, with walmsley’s ever-consistent pace finally winning out in the end with a new course-record time of 19:37:43. but with a stacked field, with nine of last year’s top 10 back for another crack at the race, and last year’s championkilian jornetout with injury, it was anyone’s bet throughout most of the race of who would come out on top. there’s never a non-chaotic start to utmb, and this year was no different."
"with nerves and excitement running high, it was france’sarthur joyeux-bouillon(pre-race interview)who led at saint-gervais, 21 kilometers in, with the entire rest of the field hot on his heels. but as darkness fell on the race and the kilometers ticked by, several distinct groups began to form. coming into les contamines, 32 kilometers in, it was zach miller, jim walmsley, and the u.k.’stom evans(pre-race interview)bunched up and running together. it looked like there would be the potential of a repeat of the miller-evans bromance from 2022, with the addition of walmsley as a third. frenchmanmathieu blanchard(pre-race interview)andpetter engdahl(pre-race interview), a swede who lives in norway,teamed up just a minute behind the leading trio, and the rest of the top-10 men came in within five minutes of the leaders. bycol du bonhomme at 44 kilometers, it was clear that walmsley was there to put his mark on the race. miller doggedly hung on 30 seconds back, and evans came through another 30 seconds in arrears, looking decidedly worse than the two men in front of him. france’sgermain grangier(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), blanchard, engdahl, and joyeux-bouillon continued to run together just eight minutes off the lead. germain grangier ran a consistent race to finish third at the 2023 utmb. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks the head of the race remained amazingly consistent over the coming kilometers tocourmayeur, 81 kilometers into the race. walmsley led miller by a handful of minutes, engdahl and grangier followed, running close to each other in third and fourth, at under 20 minutes back after evans decided to call it a day. joyeux-bouillon and blanchard stayed within half an hour of the leader in fifth and sixth. ever the aggressive racer, miller made his move before arnouvaz, 99 kilometers in. he came through the checkpoint leading a fatigued-looking walmsley by two-and-a-half minutes. many wondered if this was just another instance of walmsley taking the early race out too hard and paying for it later. grangier, joyeux-bouillon, and engdahl all came through the checkpoint within 30 minutes of miller, still well within striking distance if either of the two americans fell back. the rest of the top-10 men also remained close, with a large group containing new zeakland’sscotty hawker, france’sthibaut garrivier, blanchard, switzerland’sjean-philippe tschumi, and germany’shannes nambergercoming in hot and fast. coming over a dark and foggygrand col ferret at 103 kilometers, miller extended his lead to nearly four minutes, but walmsley looked determined and seemed to have found a second wind. grangier continued to hold strong just 12 minutes behind the leader, and the chase pack of the rest of the top 10 remained relatively unchanged with several of the men teaming up to run the final kilometers to daybreak together. it’s always a question of when the actual racing at utmb starts. that is, when do runners make their move and hope that it sticks? coming intochampex-lac at kilometer 126 on saturday morning, it was starting to seem like perhaps miller’s early move might be the one that worked for the american."
"with an 11-minute gap over grangier and walmsley, who were now running together, miller looked strong and focused. but there was still a lot of racing to do, and a lot of mountains between him and the finish. jim walmsley leading the field into courmayeur during the 2023 utmb. photo: irunfar/jaja ferer capili whether walmsley was actually in a spot of bother in the later hours of the night, or if it was all part of his strategy to hold back until daylight, everything changed when the sunlight lit up the alps. by kilometer 139 atla giète, he’d whittled his gap to miller down to two minutes, and by trient six kilometers later, he’d moved back into the lead of the race, a position he wouldn’t relinquish. grangier continued to run in third, with fourth, fifth, and sixth place, joyeux-bouillon, blanchard, and france’sludovic pommeret, all moving together 44 minutes back from the battle up front. with the kilometers ticking by, walmsley’s lead only continued to grow. at kilometer 154 atvallorcine, he was more than 13 minutes ahead of a struggling miller. seven kilometers later at tête de béchar, the gap was up to 16 minutes. from here, it would be just one more climb up to la flégère before the course tipped downward to chamonix. grangier maintained his third place up the final climb, with blanchard in fourth and pommeret in fifth, more than an hour back on the leader. garrivier ran in sixth, while hawker and joyeux-bouillon were seventh and eighth, 92 minutes back from the lead. once on the final descent, there was no touching walmsley, and one can only imagine the thoughts and emotions that must have been going through his head. after five attempts at the race, the ultimate student of the course had finally figured out how to put together the race everyone thought he was capable of. he crossed the finish line to huge cheers from the crowd with a time of 19:37:43, breaking kilian jornet’s course record of 19:49:30. wiping away tears while receiving congratulations from past utmb championfrançois d’haene, it was clear how much this victory meant to him. on his fifth attempt, jim walmsley put together all the pieces of utmb for a win and new course record in the 2023 edition of the event. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks fellow american miller came across the line in second with a time of 19:58:58, looking completely spent. this was his best finish during what can only be called an extended relationship with utmb starting in 2016. granger completed the podium with a 20:10:52. second-place zach miller looks positively spent at the 2023 utmb finish. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks blanchard, last year’s second-place utmb finisher, ended just off the podium in fourth. maybe one of the more impressive results of this years race was of pommeret in fifth. the 48-year-old masters athlete, who was the 2016 utmb champion and 2022 tds winner, showed that age really is just a number."

"there’s nothing quite like theutmbmont blanc festival week, and the 2023cccis the final lead-up to the big dance. racers, numbering 2,406 this year, took off from courmayeur, italy, on friday, september 1 at 9:15 a.m. to cover 101 kilometers (63 miles) and approximately 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) of elevation gain. the course, going in the opposite direction from thetds, which runs earlier in the week, traces a sinuous path through the mountains, paying a visit to champex-lac, switzerland, and finishing at the hub of the week’s festivities, chamonix, france. often used as a stepping stone for racers eyeing utmb in the future, it’s always a competitive race on both the men’s and women’s side, and this year was no exception. like the other races this week, the ccc was run on a slightly modified course, but the change didn’t affect its distance or vertical gain. you can also check out more results from the week’s utmb mont blanc festival: jonathan albon(u.k.) ran away with the top honors at this year’s ccc by executing what appeared to be a measured and well-planned race strategy. finishing second in the race in 2022, he had the knowledge of what he needed to do to win it. lurking in the top 10 early in the race, albon seemed content to bide his time. but when it was time to go, no one was able to stay with him. albon pulled away from the rest of the field not only by running faster, but by being incredibly efficient in the aid stations. he took on all of his nutrition and liquid while still standing, refusing to sit down and waste any time. even in a race this long, each second counts. over the top of the final climb at la flégère, he was five minutes clear of his next competitor. known for his descending, albon never looked back and finished with a time of 10:14:25. jia-sheng shen(china) came closest to matching albon’s pace to finish second, a significant improvement over his fourth-place finish in the race in 2022. shen meant business from the get-go and took the race out fast. he led for much of the time until albon’s unrelenting pace simply became too much. he finished just under 10 minutes back with a time of 10:22:30. dakota jones enjoys the finishing straight on his way to finishing third. all photos: utmb the american contingent rounded out the rest of the top six, withdakota jonestaking the final podium spot with a time of 10:41:40.jonathan reawas close behind with a time of 10:43:51, anddrew holmencame in just a few minutes back with a time of 10:47:49.seth ruhlingcame in at 10:55:14. full results. the 2023 ccc men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. jia-sheng shen, 1. jonathan albon, and 3. dakota jones. it was pure dominance fromyngvild kaspersen(norway) in the women’s race this year. finishing 30th last year must have been a learning experience that she put to good use this time around. from early in the race, she held a solid gap on her closest competitors."
"at champex-lac, 53 kilometers into the race, she was already 20 minutes up, and the gap only continued to grow. she finished in 11:51:22, nearly 40 minutes up on the next woman. the 2023 ccc women’s champion, yngvild kaspersen, coming down the finishing chute. emily hawgood(zimbabwe, lives in the u.s.) is no stranger to the utmb mont blanc festival events, and her second place here with a time of 12:28:19 showed that she’s only continuing to improve. she finished sixth last year at utmb and 10th in 2021. she’s also one of the many people who are choosing to double up a utmb festival event with the western states 100 earlier in the year. she finished an impressive fifth in that jaunt through the california mountains, a much different environment from the ccc course, showing that she’s a versatile runner who can handle many conditions. the race for the final spot on the podium came down to a battle betweenhelen mino faukner(u.s.) andhau ha thi(vietnam). with just the slightest of margins, the american was able to hold on to third with a time of 12:38:05. thi finished just 23 seconds behind. the north american contingent had a strong showing in the second half of the top 10.emily schmitz, emmiliese von avis,andtara fraga,all of the u.s., landed in the top 10, as didarden youngof canada. full results. the 2023 ccc women’s top four (l-to-r): 2. emily hawgood, 1. yngvild kaspersen, 3. helen mino faukner, and 4. hau ha thi. related articles:"
"the 2023occrace left orsières, switzerland, at 8:15 a.m. on thursday, august 31, and sent 1,729 runners through champex-lac, switzerland, and on to the finish in chamonix, france. the point-to-point route through orsières, champex-lac, and chamonix, with the abbreviated race name coming from the town names, is often called the little swiss sister ofutmb. while the course is a relatively short 55 kilometers (34.2 miles), it’s packed with an impressive 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of elevation gain through the high mountains. with a rockslide closing one of the trails between trient and col de balme, runners took a slightly more direct route than in years past, which together with cool and dry conditions, plus the ever-increasing depth of competition at this event, meant fast times. last year’s winners,manuel merillas(spain) andsheila aviles(spain) did not return to defend their titles, but there were many fast women and men to challenge for the win. you can also check out more results from the week’s utmb mont blanc festival: the depth of the women’s field for the 2023 occ was impressive, but after 55k, it wastoni mccann(south africa) who ran into chamonix solo for the win with a time of 5:18:21. last year’s occ fifth-place finisher put together a solid race start to finish and looked absolutely ecstatic, if a little bit shocked, when crossing the finish line with plenty of time to celebrate her win. the south african runner is coming off a string of victories this season already, including the davos x-trails and transvulcania by utmb 50k. the 2023 occ women’s champion toni mccann looks absolutely stunned at her victory. all photos: utmb all eyes were on the 2022 utmb champion and 2023 western states 100 second-place finisher,katie schide(u.s.), and she didn’t disappoint at this much shorter distance. an american living in france, schide has a long history with the utmb race festival events, including an additional two top-10 utmb finishes in 2019 and 2021 and a second place at ccc in 2018. in the final kilometers of the race, it was clear that schide would earn a podium spot, but it was unknown whether she’d be able to hold off a chargingmiao yao(china). with the gap hovering at 15 to 20 seconds through the final minutes of the race, it seemed possible that yao, a 2:37 marathoner, would have the leg speed to close the gap on the longer-distance specialist. but in the end, by running the steps and squeezing every last second out of the course, schide was able to hold on to second with a time of 5:26:25. yao finished in 5:27:07. full results. the 2023 occ women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. katie schide, 1. toni mccann, and 3. miao yao."
"stian angermund(norway) was first across the line for the 2023 occ on a beautiful day in chamonix with a time of 4:42:40. a blistering fast day on the course saw close times between the top four men in the final kilometers, but it was the norwegian who was able to hold on to a lead that he established just over halfway through the race. sitting in third at just under 30k into the day, he made his move on the climb up to the col de balme and never looked back. this win is another in a long line for angermund, who has already run away with victories in the trail world championships 50k and the trail des hauts forts 20k this year. surely this win was sweet redemption after his dnf at ccc in 2021. stian angermund (norway) took over the lead just over halfway and never looked back. the battle for the final podium spots remained close betweenfrancesco puppi(italy),antonio martínez(spain), andyou-sheng guan(china). puppi ran a smart race throughout, staying near the front, but was as far back as ninth place at 23k into the race, and was able to put on the gas to slowly but surely move himself into second by the end. with a final time of 4:44:58, he was able to just stay ahead of martínez, who finished on the final podium spot in 4:45:19. puppi has already had a successful season with these shorter distances, including wins in the lavaredo ultra trail by utmb 50k and the andersen half marathon trail. full results.

"when it comes to summer trail racing, there’s no greater spectacle than theutmbmont-blanc festival of races based out of chamonix, france. the 2023tds, an acronym for sur les traces des ducs de savoie, departed courmayeur, italy, just after midnight on tuesday, august 29, with some 1,650 runners lighting up the mountainous route back to chamonix. with a late summer storm moving in and bringing the snow line down to under 2,000 meters, organizers rerouted parts of the course to accommodate the bad weather that continued on throughout the event. in the 13 years covering the festival, the irunfar crew hasn’t seen the snow line come so low from a summer storm. the normally 145-kilometer (90 miles) course was extended to 153 kilometers (95 miles) while still holding on to plenty of climbing, and the extra distance combined with the difficult conditions led to extended finish times. you can also check out more results from the week’s utmb mont blanc festival: christian meier(canada) started the race relatively conservatively over the first set of mountains and the col du petit saint-bernard before pushing the pace and starting to pick off the men in front of him. he took over the lead near le pas d’outray, 90 kilometers in, and never looked back, slowly extending his lead over the rest of the field for the remainder of the race. a former professional cyclist, meier has taken to ultrarunning with great success, winning the trail andorra 50k earlier this year. he ran to his tds victory in 19:36:35. simen wästlundof sweden started out fast, leading the race for the first 90 kilometers, when meier passed him in the high mountains. he made a valiant effort to stay with the canadian and ultimately finished just over 20 minutes behind in 19:57:41. the swedish orienteer and ultrarunner recently placed 22nd at the 2023 trail world championships 80k. the 2023 tds men’s winner christian meier (right), with second-place man simen wästlund. all photos: utmb rounding out the top three wasyannick noël. the frenchman started conservatively, dropping all the way down to 10th early on in the mountains. from there, he turned on the gas, slowly clawing spots back throughout the rest of the race, finally moving into third around the col de very, 112 kilometers in. he finished just a smidge over 20 minutes back from wästlund in 20:18:02. 1 –christian meier(canada) – 19:36:352 –simen wästlund(sweden) – 19:57:413 –yannick noël(france) – 20:18:024 –jean-marie thévenard(france) – 20:29:535 –cristofer clemente(spain) – 20:43:526 –guillaume beauxis(france) – 21:02:197 –nicolas gourdon(france) – 21:02:228 –andré purschke(denmark) – 21:16:339 –paul lenoir(france) – 21:38:4110 –jean-marie diverrez(france) – 21:44:34 sage canadaywas the top american finisher in 12th with a time of 22:06:21. full results. the 2023 tds men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. simen wästlund, 1. christian meier, and 3. yannick noël. it was a clean sweep of the women’s podium for france, withmaryline nakache(france) putting on a masterclass on pacing to win the women’s race with an impressive time of 23:37:57, more than 30 minutes ahead of the next woman."

"the 2023hardrock 100set off at 6 a.m. on friday, july 14 in silverton, colorado, the small mountain town sitting in the early morning shadow of the mighty san juan mountains. faced with 102.5 miles and more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain, runners set out to traverse the massive and rugged counterclockwise loop — the event changes direction each year — around one of colorado’s most impressive mountain ranges, heading first toward lake city, then on to ouray and telluride, before returning to silverton for the finish. in the end, it wasaurélien dunand-pallaz(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of france to make it back to silverton to kiss the rock first with a time of 23:00:07. he took the race lead from the start and never looked back. for the women, it was another dominant performance fromcourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), where she not only set a counterclockwise course record with a time of 26:14:12, but also an overall women’s record and a western states 100-hardrock 100 double record with a combined time of 41:43:42 — but more on all that in a bit. but this edition of the hardrock 100 wasn’t easy for anyone. after a big winter in the san juan mountains, there was snow. and a lot of it. large snowfields flanked virginius pass/kroger’s canteen and grant-swamp pass, and snowmelt made much of the course muckier than normal. it wasn’t just the snow that would provide environmental challenges beyond the normal obstacles found in the san juans. the heat that was also unusual. with barely a cloud in the sky for the entire race and no chance of rain, temperatures soared in the 80s fahrenheit at the course’s lower elevations and caused many runners a significant amount of distress. courtney dauwalter set a new women’s course record and placed fourth overall at the 2023 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks pre-race, the men’s race seemed to be wide open with none of the top-four men of 2022 returning. instead, a handful of men, some with hardrock experience and even more without it, lined up to vie for the win. it’s probably fair to say that several men had ambitions for the win, and few were willing to pick a clear frontrunner. on the other hand, it seemed like very few were willing to bet against dauwalter for the win. fresh off of hercourse record at the 2023 western states 100just three weeks prior, the 2022 hardrock 100 champion and record holder showed up to silverton appearing recovered and ready. still, running two 100-mile races in a three-week span provides a lot of miles for something to go wrong, and there were a handful of women ready to take advantage of a potentially tired dauwalter. a special thanks tohokafor making our coverage of the hardrock 100 possible! thanks also tolekifor its support of our hardrock coverage. without any clear race favorite this year, the men’s race was wide open, and france’saurélien dunand-pallaz(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) made the most of the opportunity to go to the front immediately, leading the race line-to-line."
"even before the first mile was up, dunand-pallaz had opened up a gap on the rest of the field and never looked back, running steady and strong through the heat of the day and the dark of the night. behind dunand-pallaz, the race between the rest of the field never let up, but the gap to the leader continued to grow steadily as the hours passed. silverton localavery collins(pre-race interview)led the early chase, along withdylan bowman(pre-race interview), who had finished second here in 2021. while dunand-pallaz was running his first hardrock 100, bowman had course experience on his side, and collins had the course in his backyard to train on. aurélien dunand-pallaz led the 2023 hardrock 100 wire to wire. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi behind the two americans, another frenchman,beñat marmissolle(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), was biding his time in third.brian culmo, spaniardjavi dominguez(post-race interview),arlen glick, former hardrock 100 championjeff browning,paul terranova, andjesse haynesrounded out the top 10 in the early miles of the race. benat marmissolle climbs in the san juan mountains early in the 2023 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi coming through the maggie aid station at mile 15.5, it seemed like dunand-pallaz was going to give the men’s record a run for its money, coming in about 10 minutes under course-record pace. by this time, he was also 10 minutes up on collins, who was running in second. while dunand-pallaz’s gap on the course record had disappeared by the time he dropped into the sherman aid station at mile 30, his gap on the rest of the field had grown to 13 minutes, now with marmissolle running in second with bowman and collins just a couple of minutes back. the rest of the top 10 remained unchanged. jeff browning changes shoes in telluride, mile 74.5, before heading out for his seventh hardrock 100 finish in 2023. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi and aside from a few shuffles within the field, not a whole lot changed in the top 10 until the witching hours, after the heat of the day turned to the dark of night and legs started to get heavy. then things started to change, and quickly. while the two frenchmen continued their relentless march forward, both collins and bowman faltered, and it was dominguez who left the chapman aid station at mile 84 in third. glick was fourth, terranova fifth, and browning sixth. both collins and bowman took extended stops at chapman to regroup, losing their positions but eventually headed back out on the trail to finish. aurélien dunand-pallaz finished his first hardrock 100 in first place with the eighth-fastest time ever. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks while others struggled behind him, dunand-pallaz crested the last climb well clear of the field. marmissolle followed 40 minutes back. and from there, it was almost all downhill for the two frenchmen. dunand-pallaz ran back into silverton to kiss the rock and win his first hardrock 100 in 23:00:07, the eighth-fastest time in history."
"marmissolle finished second and was followed by dominguez who ran a steady and smart race from start to end finished third in 26:12:01. glick finished fourth with a time of 26:43:05, and browning would round out the top five with a time of 27:17:02. aurélien dunand-pallaz (left) and beñat marmissolle congratulate each other after finishing first and second at the 2023 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. javi dominguez finishes third in his first hardrock 100 in 2023. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks paul terranova and his pacer, zach miller, leave ouray, mile 58.5, late in the afternoon in the 2023 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/sarah brady if it wasn’t forcourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) running the western states 100 just three weeks prior, crushing the women’s record there, and potentially being a bit worn out at the start line of the hardrock 100, it would have been hard to find someone to bet against her winning the race this year. but if she were to falter, there were several women who were ready to jump at the opportunity. anne-lise rousset climbs happy during the early miles of the 2023 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi for the first part of the race, it seemed like france’sanne-lise rousset séguret(post-race interview) was going to do just that. while dauwalter led in the very early miles of the course, rousset opened up a sizable gap coming through maggie gulch at mile 15.5 and was moving with enthusiasm toward pole creek, the next aid station. she came into sherman at mile 30 in seventh overall in 6:29, looking strong. dauwalter was just six minutes behind, andannie hughes(pre-raceandpost-raceinterview) came in next, 52 minutes off the lead. with still many miles to run, it was still anyone’s race. frenchwomanclaire bannwarth(pre-race interview) came through just seven minutes later and was followed by japan’skimino miyazaki(pre-race interview), who was 1:22 off the lead but looking spry and happy. the top-two women came back together through grizzly gulch at mile 36 with hughes trailing them at just under an hour back. when rousset led dauwalter into grouse gulch, mile 43.5, by nearly 10 minutes after traversing handies peak, the course high point, it seemed like maybe the western states 100-hardrock 100 double was going to be too much for dauwalter to handle. claire bannwarth (left) and annie hughes share early miles in the race. photo: irunfar/eszter horanyi but it’s never a good idea to bet against the most dominant female trail ultrarunner of this generation. by mile 50, she’d closed the gap to four minutes, and in ouray at mile 58.5, it was down to two minutes. when it came to the climb out of ouray, dauwalter made her move, and the elastic to rousset finally snapped over the top of virginius pass. dauwalter never looked back."

"at 5:00 a.m. on june 24, 379 runners started the 2023western states 100. and what a day those dreamers and doers had. climbing from the palisades tahoe ski area in olympic valley, california, to meet the sunrise, the runners chased the historic 100.2-mile course through its 18,000 feet of elevation gain and 22,000 feet of loss. the course was made more wild by the past year’s weather, but the day otherwise benefited from favorable temperatures. incredible snowfall and the late 2022 mosquito fire impacted course conditions. the first 15 miles were impacted by snow, and then runners faced a newly unshaded 16-mile stretch due to the fire damage. but race-day temperatures were well off the common 100-degree-fahrenheit highs of past years. it was the race’s fourth-coolest day in history. courtney dauwalter setting a new course record at the 2023 western states 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks women’s winnercourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) shattered the longstanding course record. dauwalter’s 15:29 finish was incredibly 78 minutes better thanellie greenwood’s2012 former course best. favorable weather likely also contributed to the most sub-18-hour women’s finishes (9) in the race’s history. men’s winnertom evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) from the u.k. broke free after foresthill, mile 62, and finished in 14:40. it was the race’s fourth-fastest ever and made him a 24-minute winner. read on for more details on how the race unfolded. a special thanks tohokafor making our coverage of the western states 100 possible! none of the first four women from last year’s race —ruth croft,ailsa macdonald,marianne hogan,luzia buehler— returned. that made zimbabwe’semily hawgood(pre-race interview) the highest returning finisher from 2022. hawgood’s pretty much a race local now too, living in nearby roseville, california. but it was 38-year-oldcourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) that came into the race as a favorite. she won here in 2018 in 17:27 and was looking to avenge a late drop at the 2019 race. dauwalter was first up the escarpment. at 2,500 feet, it’s the race’s biggest climb and it happens right away in the first three miles. but 2022 utmb winnerkatie schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was right there too. schide, an american who’s lived in france for the past seven years, hit the top in 46 minutes with dauwalter and the two dropped into the granite chief wilderness together. already dauwalter and schide, age 31, had a three-minute lead on third-placeida nilsson(pre-race interview) from sweden. ida nilsson later resupplying in dusty corners. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks by mile 11, lyon ridge, dauwalter and schide’s lead on third-place nilsson had ballooned to eight minutes. and then it got even bigger as the two completely broke away from everyone else. at mile 16, red star ridge, no one was within 14 minutes of the front two. nilsson, hawgood, 2023 black canyon 100k winnerkeely henninger(pre-race interview),taylor nowlin, professional triathlete-turned-ultrarunnerheather jackson, canada’spriscilla forgieandjenny quilty, and 2022 sixth-place finisherleah yingling(pre-race interview) all ran inside the early top 10. the mosquito fire limited crew access this year and everyone met their crews for the first time at mile 30, robinson flat. dauwalter was in at 5:07 and out within a minute, and still on her 2019 splits."
"schide took a longer break and changed shoes, exiting the aid station three minutes behind the leader. the two had completely broken open the women’s race. nilsson, in her 100-mile debut, had been alone in third to this point, but was now joined by henninger, hawgood, and nowlin. courtney dauwalter rolling into the duncan canyon aid station early in the race. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks at mile 34, miller’s defeat, the course record watch started. dauwalter and schide were under dauwalter’s own 2019 splits andellie greenwood’s2012 course record pace. dauwalter was five minutes up on greenwood’s splits, and schide was three minutes faster. even more, the two were over 30 minutes in front of third-place hawgood at mile 38. dauwalter and schide were out front for the win and the course record, and the other contenders grouped behind them. dauwalter was red hot up the devil’s thumb climb at mile 48, but schide hadn’t given up much time. she took longer in aid and left six minutes after dauwalter. hawgood, nowlin, and henninger came in together next, now 40 minutes behind second-place schide. at foresthill, dauwalter was 25 minutes up on record pace. schide conceded only another two minutes over the last stretch and was 11 minutes behind dauwalter. while dauwalter and schide were still off the front, the race dynamic was heating up behind. the third- through eighth-place women were all in foresthill together with only three minutes separation. hawgood was there first among the chase group, but hungarian living in hong kongeszter csillag(post-race interview) quickly jumped from eighth at mile 52 to fourth at mile 62. nilsson was fifth, and henninger,katie asmuth, and nowlin were all there too. katie asmuth on the climb michigan bluff. photo: irunfar/jaja ferrer capili dauwalter ran 2:10 from mile 62 foresthill to mile 78 at the american river. only the men’s winner would run a quicker split on this day, and only eight men have ever run a faster split in the race — this was per the race organization’s livestream, which was citing liam/@aidstationfireb on twitter. dauwalter was five levels better than everyone else, and she was boldly racing without a pacer too. schide stayed comfortably in second, but fell further behind dauwalter’s quickening pace and river conditions necessitated that everyone cross the american river in a boat this year. from foresthill to the river, katie asmuth vaulted into third, past eszter csillag and ida nilsson. asmuth was seventh at foresthill and picked up four spots on the downhill cal street stretch, outrunning common expectations in coming back from injury. all three women split faster from foresthill to the river than schide did and even if the front two were gone, the women in general were running really fast. there’s bound to be some bad luck in a 100 miler though, and henninger fell just before the river and dislocated her shoulder. she would then drop from the race at mile 80, green gate, due to that injury."
"dauwalter’s incredible second half and incredible race brought her to the placer high school track finish in 15:29. dauwalter completely shattered the record books and set a new standard that is likely to last for a lifetime. ellie greenwood’s 16:47 course record had stood since 2012. dauwalter will next race the high altitude 2023 hardrock 100 in silverton, colorado, on july 14. dauwalter is the hardrock course record holder, too, but western states plus hardrock will certainly be a challenging double. schide challenged dauwalter early, and outpaced the rest of the women’s field in doing so. schide was in second for much of the day, ultimately finishing as runner up in 16:43. that was also under the old course record. katie schide taking second at the 2023 western states 100, under the existing course record time. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks csillag, who wasfifth at the 2022 utmb, had a remarkable second half to finish third in 17:09. it is the race’s fourth-fastest run ever. and she just edged out asmuth, who moved up from last year’s ninth-place run to finish fourth in 17:21. asmuth’s time was just inside of ruth croft’s winning time from last year, and is the race’s fifth-fastest ever. hawgood earned a second straight fifth-place finish. in 2022 she was able to finish fifth in 18:16 and in this year’s faster race hawgood was fifth in 17:26. that time ranks eighth-best ever and is just faster than what dauwalter ran to win in 2018. taylor nowlin improved her finish place by one from prior year, but like hawgood greatly improved her finish time. nowlin was sixth in 17:40. one-hundred-mile debutante ida nilsson was seventh in 17:43, and priscilla forgie was just minutes back in eighth at 17:46. leah yingling was a repeat top-10 finisher in ninth at 17:49. for perspective, no year had seen more than three women finish under 18 hours before. but this year nine women finished under 18 hours. it is the new standard for women’s racing at western states. the 25-year-oldmeghan morgantook the prized 10th-place finish in 18:11, thereby guaranteeing a chance to automatically return next year. eszter csillag getting helped by a volunteer early in the race at dusty corners. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. leah yingling, eszter csillag, and meghan morgan running together at robinson flat. photo: irunfar/jaja ferrer capili there’s nowhere to go but up at the start of the western states 100, andjia-ju zhaofrom china charged the opening climb. despite snow, zhao hit the top in 42 minutes. slower to the top, frenchmanmathieu blanchard(pre-race interview) and brittom evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) turned to greet the brilliant sunrise together. zhao won the ultra-trail mt. fuji 100 mile in april 2023 and is a two-time winner of the doi inthanon by utmb 100 mile in thailand. he pushed his early lead to five minutes at lyon ridge, mile 11, while 2022 fourth-placertyler green(post-race interview) led the early chase group.green had finished as high as second here before, in 2021, but was running more aggressively toward the front earlier than ever before."
"tyler green opening up his stride later in the race coming into foresthill. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks from mile-15 red star ridge to mile-25 duncan canyon, the chase group started to make up time on zhao. tom evans, chinese runnerjia-sheng shen, anddakota jones(pre-race interview) were among a group that cut four minutes from zhao’s lead over just nine miles.evans was third here in 2019 in 14:59, and jones had just biked 680 miles from his home in utah to the race start. zhao was quickly swallowed up in the next five miles to robinson flat, mile 30, and soon fell out of the top 10. a lead trio of tom evans, dakota jones, and jia-sheng shen came into aid at 4:45, meeting their crews for the first time. at mile 30 and with zhao falling backward,anthony costales(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was fourth, and then he was with tyler green at mile 38 in fourth and fifth. the two would barely separate the rest of the race. anthony costales later racing up to michigan bluff. photo: irunfar/jaja ferrer capili evans and jones dropped shen on the climb to devil’s thumb, mile 48, and the two leaders came into aid together in 7:03. four minutes back costales had caught shen on the big climb, and tyler green,jeff colt, new zealand’sdaniel jones,ryan montgomery, mathieu blanchard, and 47-year-oldludovic pommeretwere inside the top 10. those six were 14 minutes apart. 2022 third- and second-place finishersarlen glick(pre-race interview) andhayden hawks(pre-race interview) were back in 11th and 16th, respectively. after earlier moving up, hawks had just lost several places and would later drop with injury at mile 55. other top-10 finishers from 2022cody lind,scott traer, andalex nicholswere all noticeably outside the top 10 too. as the race shifted to its mile-62 foresthill hub, evans gained some separation on jones and entered the aid station first, but as evans changed shoes and socks, jones didn’t wait and exited first. jones was now in the lead by himself for the first time and he was overheard voicing his intention to break evans. some 11 minutes back of those two leaders, green and costales were again together and in third and fourth. shen and jeff colt were just minutes back of those two, and colt was remarkably almost an hour faster than a year ago when he finished 11th. tom evans and dakota jones locked in a duel climbing to michigan bluff. photo: irunfar/jaja ferrer capili jones and evans separated leaving foresthill and anticipation ran high for their next steps. the two had been together for nearly the entirety of the race to this point. jones wanted to make a move and evans wanted to keep up with (the) jones. the duel ended quickly and dramatically though."
"tom evans dropped hard down cal street, hitting what he said at the finish was a 5:54 minute/mile, and hit cal 2, mile 71, in 10:12. that surge pushed jones eight minutes back at mile 71. it was just nine miles from foresthill to that split on cal street, but the front two had shattered and moved in opposite directions the rest of the race. evans ran alone to the river crossing at mile 78, and ultimately to the finish. tyler green, anthony costales, jeff colt, and jia-sheng shen all overtook dakota jones on the way to the river too. forget about elm street, jones was having a bit of a nightmare on cal street. evans, the 2022 utmb third placer, continued to put time on the field the rest of the way. he finished in 14:40 and that’s the race’s fourth fastest finish ever. the mark trails onlyjim walmsleyandjared hazenin 2019, and walmsley’s 2018 mark too. evans was a runaway winner, but the rest of the top 10 was much more closely packed. tom evans winning the 2023 western states 100 in 14:40. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks tyler green pushed on in second, and held off an anthony costales chase over the last 15 miles. green finished in 15:04. it was his second runner-up finish and a big personal best for the course. he was able to finish with his baby boy on his shoulders. green’s 15:04 was the race’s 11th-fastest finish ever. costales was third in 15:09, the race’s 13th-fastest finish ever. jia-sheng shen and daniel jones both finished fast. shen clocked 15:19 and jones was fifth in 15:22. mathieu blanchard and ryan montgomery both overtook jeff colt late. those three — blanchard, montgomery, and colt — finished in 15:37, 15:38, and 15:42, respectively. local runnercole watsonbettered his 2022 14th-place finish with a ninth-place 15:54. in 2019 the top 10 all went under 16 hours. this year’s 10th-place manjanosch kowalczykfrom germany just missed matching that feat. he finished in 16:09. seven of last year’s top 10 returned, but only tyler green was able to again make the top 10. the 2022 top 10 finishers ludovic pommeret, arlen glick, scott traer, cody lind, and alex nichols finished 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th, and 28th this year, respectively. as earlier mentioned, 2022 runner-up hayden hawks dropped. after running near or in the lead through foresthill, dakota jones finished 17th in 17:00. early leader zhao’s high risk, high reward start ended with a drop at michigan bluff, mile 55. jeff colt approaching the river crossing on his way to finishing eighth. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. jia-sheng shen approaching the river crossing on his way to taking fourth. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks thanks so much to the following individuals who helped irunfar cover this race: marissa harris, lance hartzler, casey wyatt, rachel and michael barrington, jaja and a.j. ferrer capili, andy-jones wilkins, makiko yamashita, jec ballou, kirk edgerton, martin and alison nash, julie sachs, grace lattyak, peach villalobos, mike dasalla, rachael sage, and sonia lachapelle. our race production is a community production! related articles:"

"now, all that stood between the front end of the race and the finish was a final 1,000-meter (3,400 feet) climb and a wild drop back down into innsbruck. while anything could happen, with more than a four-minute lead, it seemed like it was reiterer’s lead to lose. france’s benjamin roubiol climbing at 41 kilometers into the 2023 trail world championships 80k. he would go on to win the race. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks but on the final climb of the race, the ever-patient roubiol made his move, surging into the lead at aspachhütte at 71k, and opening a four-minute gap on a fading reiterer. roubiol looked incredibly focused as he made his way up the mountain. fraňo and garrivier remained solid in third and fourth, and miller started to make good on his promise of still having legs, moving into fifth. the gap between roubiol and reiterer only continued to grow, eight minutes at 73k, and nine minutes at 75k, as they made their way to the top of the final climb. fraňo stayed strong in third, garrivier in fourth, and miller and fárník continued to battle for fifth, 25 minutes off the lead. peter fraňo of slovakia on his way to finishing third at the 2023 trail world championships 80k. here, he’s running at 78 kilometers into the race. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks from there, it was all downhill to the finish. benjamin roubiol flew down the final descent to win the 2023 trail world championships 80k in 9:52:59. reiterer followed just under eight minutes back, the gap holding steady the whole descent. fraňo and garrivier both held onto their places to finish third and fourth. behind them, u.s. teammatesdrew holmenanderic lipumamade a strong push to catch up to their teammate miller. holmen would out sprint miller at the line, and the two were followed less a minute later by lipuma, the trio taking fifth through seventh. for the team competition, chassagne would be the third french finisher in 17th place, securing the team victory for france. the strong fifth through seventh finishes of the u.s. men slotted them into second in the team competition, just over five minutes behind the french in over 30 hours of cumulative racing. reiterer would lead the italian team to a third-place finish. thibaut garrivier of france took fourth at the 2023 trail world championships 80k, but it was a challenge for him all day. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. benjamin roubiol, 2023 trail world championships 80k winner. photo: irunfar/bryon powell men’s teams andreas reiterer celebrates taking second place at the 2023 trail world championships 80k. photo: irunfar/bryon powell as with the men’s race, some of the pre-race favorites bowed out of the race early on withblandine l’hirondel(pre-race interview) dropping on the “start loop” out of neustift due to foot pain from an existing injury. the rest of the field charged on, led up the first climb bymarcela vašínová(pre-race interview) of the czech republic,martina valmassoi(pre-race interview) of italy, andakiyama honokaof japan."

"rachid again took off in front, but in the latter part of the stage and on a smooth run into the finish, he was overtaken by his brother mohamed, who won the stage in a time of 2:29, less than a minute ahead of rachid in second and yachou in third. rachid still held the overall lead by a narrow margin at the end of the stage, followed by mohamed and yachou. blanchard, who had finished fifth in the second stage behind russia’svasilii korytkin, held on to fourth place overall. aziz yachou takes second at the 2023 marathon des sables. photo: irunfar/jon bromley in the third stage of around 34k, mohamed asserted his dominance, winning the stage in 2:30 to rachid and yachou’s 2:33, and extending his overall lead to three minutes. blanchard continued to hold his own in fourth place. the men’s podium race for stage 4 was so tight, especially given that it was the one long stage in the week in racing, this year clocked at 90k. mohamed again crossed the line first, in 8:14:39. yachou finished the stage in second place, just six seconds behind the lead, and rachid arrived in third, only 19 seconds behind the winner. this tight race kept mohamed in the lead in the overall classification, rachid in second, and yachou in third, but with a spread of only a few minutes. controversy ensued following this fourth stage, when rachid was issued a three-hour time penalty for receiving outside assistance and withdrew from the race, which we have more on ina separate news piece. after rachid withdrew from the race, yachou moved up to second place in the overall classification. blanchard, who was steadily running his own race behind the leaders, now found himself in podium position. on the marathon-distance stage 5, the last competitive stage, mohamed continued his show of strength to finish in 3:18, five minutes clear of yachou in second. in a total time of 19:19:54 for the five competitive stages, mohamed el morabity was crowned the 2023 marathon des sables men’s champion. a battle ensued behind, with vasilii korytkin eventually beating blanchard to the line, to take third place in stage 5. however, blanchard hung on to third place overall in a time of 21:21:27. mathieu blanchard celebrates taking third at the 2023 marathon des sables. photo: irunfar/jon bromley full results. the fast first stage was dominated as expected by 2019 winnerragna debats, who finished in 3:26, almost 10 minutes clear ofmaryline nakachein second. the top local wasaziza el amranyof morocco, who followed in third in 3:53. while this was nakache’s first appearance at this race, el amrany was returning following a third place at the 2022 edition. the more mountainous terrain on stage 2 played to debats’s strengths, and she romped home in 3:19 to nakache’s 3:36, thus extending her overall lead to around 28 minutes. el amrany continued to run steady in third position. into the third stage, debats finished 11 minutes ahead of nakache, for the stage win."

"things would stay dynamic because, after that, tremps closed that to less than seven minutes at garañon (90k). then lowther started rebuilding that gap to 12 minutes at tunte (102k) and almost 17 minutes at ayaguares 114k) … but tremps more than cut that gap in half in the final 14k to the finish, with lowther taking second by just under seven minutes and tremps coming home in third. phew, talk about some great push and pull between lowther and tremps for the women’s podium positions. katharina hartmuthof germany didn’t go out with the eventual women’s podium. she was already five minutes behind tremps at the first aid station and 10 to 15 minutes behind her for much of the race, being only 12 minutes behind the spaniard at tejada. while hartmuth kept moving up in the overall field, tremps kept growing her lead over the german over the race’s final 50k, with hartmuth finishing fourth woman. belgium’sdominique van mechgelen, who lives on gran canaria, was with hartmuth at the first checkpoint 11k in but slowly lost ground to the german, falling as far back as 53 minutes behind her at garañon, before eventually taking the fifth women’s position, 44 minutes behind hartmuth. jazmine lowther finishing second at the 2023 transgrancanaria classic 128k. photo: transgrancanaria/jordi saragossa full results. claudia tremps running through the night at the 2023 transgrancanaria classic 128k. photo: transgrancanaria/jordi saragossa while most of the women in the top 10 at the race’s first checkpoint at 11k ended up in the top 10, that was not the case in the men’s race. wow. of the 14 men to be within about two minutes of the lead at 11k, six would go on to drop out, including the top three at that point:abel carretero(spain),jia-sheng shen(china), andfotios zisimopoulus(greece). now, the guy in fourth at that very early interval – spain’sandreu simon– well, you’ll continue hearing about him. he, countryman and past transgrancanaria champpau capell, and romania’sraul butaciwere all within a minute of the lead, with france’sarthur joyeux-bouillon, switzerland’sjonas russi, the u.s.’styler green, and romania’sionel manolerounding out the top 10 in the early going. by 30k at teror, zisimopoulus, carretero, simon, butaci, and shen were all still within roughly a minute of the lead, with capell,mario olmedo(spain),miguel arsénio(portugal), green, and russi all between three and five minutes off the front. things were much the same at fontanales (43k), with the same top five all within just over a minute and, really, all together except butaci a bit over a minute back, and that next group of arsénio, green, capell, and olmedo having condensed at just over five minutes off the lead. andreu simon leading abel carretero during the 2023 transgrancanaria classic 128k. photo: transgrancanaria/jordi saragossa just 10k later at el hornillo, butaci shot into the lead, with carretero, shen, and simon chasing 30 seconds back and zisimopoulus being dropped three minutes off the front. the chase group of olmedo, arsénio, green, and capell were now eight to nine minutes back."
"butaci continued to push the pace to artenara, putting an 80-second gap on simon, 3.5 minutes on carretero, and 5.5 minutes on shen, while zisimopoulus was about to get caught by the chase group led by green and capell around 11 minutes off the lead. and then, not long after the sun came up, the race blew up. simon took the lead on the way to tejeda (78k) and put 2.5 minutes on butaci before the aid station with carretero just 3.5 minutes back, but carretero would withdraw from the race there. ten minutes off the lead, arsénio was clear in fourth, with green, shen, manole, and capell in fifth through eighth at 12 to 14 minutes back, with zisimopoulus and olmedo 19 and 23 minutes back. however, both shen and olmedo would also drop in tejeda. moving to tunte at 102k, the men’s race would continue to see more post-dawn carnage, with manole (who was fifth upon arrival at tunte) and olmedo both withdrawing there. with those drops, simon lead the race by 4.5 minutes over arsénio. butaci and green sat 13.5 and 16.5 minutes off the lead in third and fourth. and capell had just over a minute lead onjoaquin lopezof ecuador for fifth. miguel arsénio running in the high country of gran canaria as day comes to the 2023 transgrancanaria classic 128k. photo: transgrancanaria/jordi saragossa a full 114k into the race at ayaguares, simon had a nearly five-minute lead on arsénio. andreu simon would go on to win with that same five-minute lead over miguel arsénio. while those two guys were flying, raul butaci was pulling his parachute. tyler green flew past him on the way to ayaguares before taking third some 20 minutes out of second, but nine minutes clear of butaci in fourth. meanwhile, pau capell and joaquin lopez came into ayaguares neck-and-neck, but capell’s experience paid off, with him edging out the ecuadorian by eight minutes over the final 14k to take fifth. full results. tyler green finishing third at the 2023 transgrancanaria classic 128k. photo: transgrancanaria/jordi saragossa related articles:"

"they say that neither rain nor shine will stop the mail carriers of the world from delivering their mail, and the same can be said for ultrarunners. while a significant storm about a week before the 2023tarawera by utmb 102krace weekend caused a landslide and other issues around the remote course based in the city of rotorua, on the north island of new zealand, the race organization rerouted the course last minute and the show went on. the covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on tarawera for the last few years, with the 2021 event held for local runners only due to the country’s borders being closed, and the 2022 event canceled due to a country-wide outbreak. for 2023, new zealand’s borders are reopened and tarawera once again welcomed runners from far and wide. while going on a decade, the 100-kilometer race at tarawera has attracted international talent, it’s also been a western states 100 golden ticket race for a few years, wherein for this year two women and two men are awarded entry to the 2023 western states 100. all of these variables collided early saturday morning, february 11, as 776 runners streamed off an improvised starting line on the northern shores of lake okataina, east of rotorua, heading for the rotorua finish line. some 100 kilometers of racing later, beginning in cool, humid weather and running through warm and still humid weather with peeks of sun through a decent cloud bank all day, it was the national talent that ran best. new zealand’snancy jiangtopped the women’s race anddaniel jonestook home the men’s win. read on for more details about both races. scenery on the 2023 tarawera 102k course. photo: tim bardsley-smith if the 2023 tarawera 102k women’s race is a predictor of what this year is going to look like for women’s trail ultrarunning, we all had better pay attention. it was the women’s race that stayed competitive wire-to-wire, with the top five women finishing within 12 minutes of championnancy jiangof new zealand. this marks the closest women’s race in the decade-plus of tarawera 102k history — by a long way. the u.s.’samanda bashamwas the early race leader, pushing what other women called a hot early pace. she led for roughly the race’s first third before slowing to an ultimate eighth place. then, before the race’s marathon mark,stephanie austonof australia assumed the race lead. but a passel of women stayed close all day. at the final checkpoint, around six kilometers from the finish, jiang and auston ran together, a couple of meters separating them, with jiang at the helm. when jiang crossed the line in victory, only 90 seconds of daylight separated her and second-place auston. jiang is a multi-time champion of new zealand’s iconic kepler challenge, and in 2022 she was 22nd at the ccc in france. preceding auston’s second place at the tarawera 102k by less than two months was a victory at the 2022 ultra-trail kosciuszko by utmb 100k in her home country. spain’saroa siospent the entire race running within the women’s top five."
"vacillating all race between second and fifth positions, sio crossed the line in third place and just about three minutes behind second. sio appears primed for another big year, following up on her strong 2022, which included takingthird at the canyons by utmb 100k, 12th at the western states 100, and eighth at utmb. following the women’s podium only five minutes later was fourth placeanna mckennaof australia, and china’sfu-zhao xiangin fifth, the pair only separated by another two minutes. at the time of this article’s publishing, it was not publicly known who (if anyone) in the women’s race has yet accepted the western states 100 golden tickets. two are given out, runners have a couple of weeks to decide if they’d like to accept them, and the tickets roll down as far as fifth place as needed. among the top five women, no woman already has a western states 100 entry by other means. nancy jiang, 2023 tarawera 102k champion. photo: graeme murray full results. i was really rooting for new zealand’sdaniel jonesto get a western states 100 golden ticket, as he’s been trying for four races to earn one. jones intended to race the 2022 tarawera 102k, but it was canceled last minute due to the covid-19 pandemic, and its golden tickets were doled out at other events in the series. then, a few months later, in april of 2022, he took 10th in a tough day at the canyons by utmb 100k, another golden ticket race for which he traveled to the u.s. to participate in. after not earning a ticket there, he stayed on in the u.s. to attempt another shot at a ticket, mistaking the 2022 lake sonoma 100k for a golden ticket race. he won the race, but heartbreakingly learned after the fact that it wasn’t part of the series — in all fairness the lake sonoma 50 mile was a golden ticket race for many years — and went home without that golden ticket. all this is to say that when the men’s race fired off in the 2023 tarawera 102k, i couldn’t help but really want jones to earn one of those tickets. but some 102 kilometers worth of earning he would have to do. sam mccutcheon, who is from new zealand, but who lives in the u.k., was the race’s early pacesetter. like amanda basham on the women’s side, mccutcheon largely set the pace for the men through the event’s first third. however, there were always other guys right there, running within seconds of the lead. after the 38k aid station, jones and the u.s.’shayden hawksshook free of mccutcheon as well as the rest of the men’s field, settling into what looked like roughly a shared leadership of the pole position. according to the pair, they are friends and have been training partners over the last year both when jones traveled to the u.s. and when hawks traveled to new zealand. there was some leapfrogging, we believe, before jones was able to shake free of hawks too, to lead the race solo."
"at the penultimate aid station, 87k into the race, jones led solo with a five-minute gap on hawks, which he extended to more than 14 minutes by the finish line. we understand that jones is eagerly accepting his western states 100 golden ticket. hawks crossed the line in second, saying afterward on social media that he’d run his own best race and was happy with his performance. hawks already has an entry to the western states 100 courtesy of asecond place there last year, which means the second golden ticket rolls down the finisher’s list. ryan montgomeryfrom the u.s. raced smart, shadowing those pressing at the front but setting their own sustainable pace. that meant running in the back half of the top 10 for the race’s first third, moving up to podium position around the close of the race’s second third, and holding that spot through the finish line, some 40-plus minutes behind the leader. montgomery, who identifies as nonbinary but who raced in the men’s race, wrote on social media that they are excited about earning that western states 100 golden ticket. mccutcheon ultimately rolled across the line in fourth place, and australia’srhett gipsontook fifth. daniel jones, 2023 tarawera 102k champion. photo: graeme murray full results. the tarawera by utmb event held races over three other distances, including 21k, 50k, and 100 miles. two more 2023 western states 100 golden ticket races remain, arizona’sblack canyon 100kon february 18, and thecanyons by utmb 100kin auburn, california, on april 28. related articles:"

"congratulations to all the runners who were chosen for the 2023hardrock 100! the hardrock 100 is a 100-mile race bearing 33,000 feet of climbing that goes in a loop around colorado’s gorgeous san juan mountains, starting and finishing in the small town of silverton. the course regularly visits altitudes above 13,000 feet and boasts several climbs exceeding 4,000 vertical feet. the event alternates directions on its loop each year, with the 2023 event heading in the counterclockwise direction. the hardrock 100 has one of the most difficult lotteries to enter the run — in part because the qualifying races which you have to finish in order to enter the event lotto themselves are all notoriously challenging, and in part because, for this year, some 2,414 people vied for the event’s 146 spots. in this article, we attempt to distill the complicated lotto process and highlight those runners who we expect will make a speedy lap around the san juans at the front of those 146 very lucky participants. sunrise on grant-swamp pass during the 2017 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/vince heyd the hardrock 100 lottery is complicated, so setting the stage with the parameters of this year’s lotto gives context for the rest of this article. the 2023 hardrock 100 will start 146 runners. as mentioned at the outset of this article, 2,414 people applied for the lottery. this is significantly up from the 2022 lotto which had 1,916 applicants. the 2023 lottery was divided into two categories, the never finished and finished divisions: for 2023, the event chose 73 runners from each category. for the 2022 event and beyond, the organization adopted a gender policy to help account for the historic underrepresentation of women in the hardrock 100. the policy states that the event will start at least the percentage of women who apply for the lotto. for 2023, 19.7% of the lotto applicants were women, so 29 of the 146 starters will be women for 2023. the organization allotted 18 of those spots to the never finished category and nine of those spots to the finished category. historically, several runners are chosen ahead of time by the run director,dale garland, and announced among the names chosen in the lottery. the run organization indicated garland chose six runners for 2023, and those entries were applied to their respective categories. returning champions are given entrance to the event. the 2022 women’s championcourtney dauwalterhas accepted that entry, while 2022 men’s champkilian jornetdeclined it. dauwalter’s entry comes from the finished category. there are four runners whose 2022 entries were deferred to 2023, and whose entries were applied to their respective categories. all told, it looks like the lotto selected 135 runners for 2023, with the 11 remaining entrants dale’s picks, the reigning women’s champion, and the 2022 deferments. the chances of a runner gaining entry to hardrock depend upon which division of the lotto they are in and how many tickets they have in the lotto."
"thehardrock 100 website’s lottery pageexplains the details and nuances, but in short, tickets are gained through previous finishes as well as volunteer service to the organization. in addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into four division- and gender-specific waitlists. even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is competitive in nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit upon which the hardrock 100 prides itself. in the rest of this article, we document the women and men who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist with a reasonable chance to get in. bogie dumitrescu after finishing the 2015 hardrock 100 one second before the 48-hour cutoff. photo: blake wood as mentioned above, just about the only way to gain automatic entry to the hardrock 100 is by winning. the 2022 women’s champion courtney dauwalterwill be back to defend her title. below are the notable women who were chosen in the 2023 lottery as well as the defending champ, listed in alphabetical order: full entrants list and waitlists. courtney dauwalter winning and setting a course record at the 2022 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/bryon powell here are the notable men who were chosen in the 2023 lottery, listed in alphabetical order: full entrants list and waitlists. aurélien dunand-pallaz (left) after taking second to françois d’haene at the 2021 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell these are the fast women who are high enough on their respective waitlists that they might get in before race day. we’re listing them in the order in which they appear on waitlists: full entrants list and waitlists.

"the 2022run rabbit run 100 milegot underway friday, september 16. the “hares and tortoises,” as race organizers playfully frame competitors, started from steamboat springs, colorado, at noon and 8 a.m. local time, respectively. they then clambered through the day, night, and day again over an exhaustive roundtrip through the mountain bike trails and dirt roads encircling the town. the circuit is nothing if not a rugged one: the race website says an entire eight miles of it are paved, 86 are trails, and the remainder consist of “rough jeep roads.” over “about 101.5 miles,” runners ascend some 20,391 feet — then descend it, of course. this year, the weather featured heavily, with waves of rain heavily wetting the course, making it, at times, a humorous slip-and-slide. for the hares, mainly consisting of highly attuned professionals, there was a lot at stake in the high-altitude race. prize purses totaled $75,000, distributed equally between both the top-seven men and women. each winner snagged $15,000, what together represent one of the highest prize purses in ultrarunning. men’s leaders began to trickle into the finish line just before dawn on saturday, september 17, with the top women a few hours behind. in the men’s competition,richard lockwoodprevailed, breaking away from the rest of the men at a little over halfway, and never failing to relinquish his lead at any timed checkpoint overarlen glickin second place. on the women’s side,annie hughestailed her competitors early before taking the lead about a third of the way through the race, methodically adding time on her chasers, and posting a decisive victory. the start of the 2022 run rabbit run 100 mile. all photos: irunfar/meghan hicks richard lockwoodnever wavered in the punishing 100 miler, at times appearing obstinate in his determination to lead glick. at long lake, 24.3 miles in, the two ran together about a half minute off the lead pace and 10 seconds apart. six miles later at summit lake, they were still in the thick of it together. richard lockwood, 2022 run rabbit run 100 mile champion. but it wasavery collinswho got off to a hot start and led the field through about the halfway point. by dry lake at mile 44.5, he’d built his lead on the field to over eight minutes. however, by 64 miles into the race, lockwood was in lockstep with collins, and would take over the lead and run away with things. and by the second long lake timing point at 89 miles, lockwood led by what might as well have been light years. no one ran within an hour of his pace by the finish line. nick elson(canada) did lead glick late, by up to 79 seconds at the mile 95.8 mark, but couldn’t hang on for the rousing final descent and finished third. glick turned around hispodium finish at the western states 100earlier this year, and elson debuted well in his first 100 miler. samuel collinstook fourth, and the other collins, the early leader avery, finished in fifth position. full results."

"for the first time since 2018, runners lined up for the 2022iau 100k world championships. this year’s edition, hosted by the town of bernau, germany, just northeast of berlin, saw athletes from 42 countries tackle the flat-and-fast course on the wide wandlitzer chaussee, a wind-protected path through the neighboring forests. all of the race festivities centered around the city’s bernau bauhaus monument, with runners coming back through the start and finish line a total of 14 times. runners started out with a quick 2.5-kilometer opening lap before embarking on 13 laps of a triple out-and-back, 7.5k course with two tight 180-degree hairpin turns and one more gradual turn through the start/finish area. the unique format of this race allowed competitors to see each other potentially up to three times per lap. with minimal elevation gain on the course, it was a perfect setup to see records being broken. in the women’s field, the favorites includedcamille chaigneauandfloriane hot, both of france. for the men, it seemed that the japanese team would be dominant with previous 100-kilometer world record holdernao kazamiamong the field. it was just a matter of how many team members the japanese contingent could place on the podium, and who would be the one to try to knock them off. in the 100-strong women’s field, it was the french team to watch with the top duo ofcamille chaigneauandfloriane hot. as the 2022 french 100-kilometer national champion, hot had high ambitions for the race. it was a fast start at the front of the field for chaigneau, who quickly showed her intentions of taking control of the race. just a little over halfway, at 55 kilometers, she led the field with a minute gap over finland’ssatu lipiäinen.courtney olsenof the usa,caitriona jenningsof ireland, andfloriane hotof france all sat in the top five biding their time. after 70 kilometers, the top five stayed nearly the same, with only olsen slipping two positions down the leaderboard to fifth. the gaps remained small between the top five and the order unchanged for the next 10 kilometers before hot surged to the lead at 80 kilometers, quickly putting a 36-second gap on teammate chaigneau. a fading chaigneau couldn’t hold on to the relentless pace over the closing kilometers, eventually losing nearly a minute and a half to hot but retaining her second position. jennings made a valiant attempt to catch chaigneau, but was only able to get within 45 seconds, and olsen and lipiäinen raced hard to the end, finishing within eight seconds of each other for fourth and fifth. hot’s time of 7:04:03 bested her previous 100-kilometer personal record of 7:42 by a lot and was a european record for the distance. jennings’s third-place finish was a world record in the women’s 40 to 49 age group. in the women’s team race, team usa took home gold, with france and japan earning silver and bronze, respectively. the top-three individual finishers of each team scored for the team event. team usa was led by olsen’s fourth-place finish,anna kacius’sseventh place, andnicole monette’s11th place."

"thanks to hoka for sponsoring irunfar’s coverage of the 2022 utmb. this year’sutmbmen’s race was billed as a likely showdown between two of the greats in men’s ultrarunning,jim walmsley(pre-race interview) andkilian jornet(post-race interview), with predictions that whoever came out ahead would also hold a new course record. and while it initially seemed that the race would play out as expected, with walmsley and jornet trading blows for the first 142 kilometers, it would bemathieu blanchard(post-race interview) who made the final attempt to dethrone jornet. but it was not to be, with jornet breaking both previous course records, by a significant margin, in a time of 19:49:30. the women’s side of the 2022 utmb had an openness that perhaps fans had not felt in years. with no previous champions or clear favorites on the starting line, instead, we all ruminated about the 10 or 12 women with the potential to win or challenge for it. even then, we all also noticed the deepening women’s field year over year, with this one likely requiring getting to the finish line quicker than was previously normal to secure a top-10 finish. from the start line,katie schide(pre– andpost-race interviews) led aggressively, only relinquishing the lead for a handful of kilometers around daybreak during a rough patch, before getting her stomach under control and finishing with a time of 23:15:12 way in front of the rest of the field. covering 171.5 kilometers (106.5 miles), the utmb creates an aesthetic and rugged loop around mont blanc in the alps. starting and ending in chamonix, france, before paying a visit to both italy and switzerland, the loop has some 10,000 meters (32,800 feet) of elevation gain and loss. arguably the most competitive trail ultramarathon of the year, utmb is an event to behold. the final and most prestigious race of the week-long utmb mont-blanc festival, it reliably draws top talent and some of the biggest crowds in the sport. this year, 2,795 starters headed out from chamonix at 6 p.m. on friday, august 26, under cloudy skies and a sprinkle of rain, but with a forecast for potential rain and thunderstorms throughout the evening. the forecasted storms never really materialized, and runners enjoyed favorable weather throughout the race. jornet and schide took similar paths to the win, both starting out strong before fading in the middle of the race and then surging to the front when it really mattered. and both saw strong challenges from second-place finishers, blanchard andmarianne hogan(post-race interview). several top runners would end up dropping out due to various ailments, including last year’s third-place womanmimmi kotka(pre-race interview) and sixth-place manhannes namberger(pre-race interview). enjoy our2022 utmb photo galleryas well. a special thanks tohokafor making our coverage of utmb possible! thanks also tosquirrel’s nut butterandbuff®for their support of our utmb coverage. the start of the 2022 utmb on friday, august 26, 2022. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein as expected, the men took the race out fast from the start on the relatively flat roads and trails from chamonix to the village of les houches."
"spain’spau capell(pre-race interview), the 2019 utmb winner, led a charging group through les houches, seven kilometers into the race, followed closely bymathieu blanchard(post-race interview), a frenchman living in canada, andjia-ju zhaoandguo-min deng, both of china. all the top contenders were in a massive chase pack, settling in for the long night and day ahead. it didn’t take long forjim walmsley(pre-race interview) of the usa to make his intentions for this year’s race clear, coming into saint-gervais, at 20 kilometers into the race, in the lead, looking strong and relaxed.kilian jornet(post-race interview) and capell were just seconds behind with deng, zhao, and americanzach miller(post-race interview) making up a chase group half a minute in arrears. they were followed by frenchmangermain grangier, blanchard, frenchmanthibaut garrivier, andyan-qiao yunof china. unsurprisingly, by les contamines, 31 kilometers into the race, it was shaping up to be a showdown between walmsley and jornet. they came into the aid station together looking relaxed, walmsley taking the time to high-five fans, and were shortly on their way into the night together. capell and miller came in just 30 seconds back, and grangier rounded out the top five, just a minute behind them. a notable withdrawal around this time due to physical issues is last year’s second-place finisher, frenchmanaurélien dunand-pallaz(pre-race interview). climbing over the high col du bonhomme, 43 kilometers in, walmsley, miller, jornet, andtom evans(pre-andpost-race interviews) of the u.k. shared the lead. with 1,160 meters (3,800 feet) of climbing down just on this one climb, everyone in the group looked relaxed and was moving well. capell was just 90 seconds back, trying not to let the elastic to the front group snap in the dark of the night on the run over to col du bonhomme before the long descent into the remote french outpost of les chapieux. the u.k.’s tom evans on his way to the 2022 utmb start line. he would eventually place third. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein the four leaders stayed together down to les chapieux, 50 kilometers into the race, where last year’s winner, françois d’haene — not participating this year — was spectating and cheering on runners. unfortunately, capell had lost contact with the lead group over the previous section, coming into the aid station more than two minutes back. the rest of the top nine stayed relatively the same witherik sorensonof the usa slotting in 10th for the first time. coming into lac combal, 66 kilometers into the race, after crossing country borders into italy and traversing the most remote part of the course, walmsley and jornet had only slightly pulled away, their gap to miller and evans hung at a tenuous minute. all four looked strong, but it seemed like pre-race predictions of a two-man showdown were about to be realized. walmsley, with his arms and legs fully covered from the cold of the night but shirt front open, came into the town of courmayeur, 80 kilometers in, solo and in the lead, but his gap on jornet was just 80 seconds."
"both men were moving well and left the aid station together after only a few minutes. it was a significant 12 minutes before evans and miller came through, staying in courmayeur for under three minutes. blanchard, looking more relaxed than any of the previous four, was also in and out of the aid station quickly, 18 minutes off the lead. known for his slower starts and late race surges, blanchard appeared to know exactly what he was doing. it was never a question of if walmsley or jornet would strike out on their own, it was just a matter of when. walmsley was the first to throw down a serious acceleration, coming into arnouvaz (97 kilometers) solo and with a 2.5-minute gap on jornet. both were in and out of the aid station quickly, looking strong and motivated. blanchard also chose the trail between courmayeur and arnouvaz to make his move, coming into the arnouvaz aid station in third, looking very controlled and 14 minutes behind the leaders. he was familiar with that position in the race, having finished third in utmb in 2021. he was also familiar with the race tactic of starting slower, letting the leaders fight it out early and tire themselves out, and then moving up as the fast starters dropped back. it had brought him success the previous year, and he was seemingly employing the strategy again. miller and evans continued to run near each other, what evans would later refer to as a “bromance” that lasted over half the race, and both looked like they had less spring in their step than the men ahead of them. committed to making the move stick, walmsley climbed the grand col ferret at 102 kilometers with a strong powerhike and held a five-minute gap over jornet. seemingly unconcerned with his position, jornet chatted in french with both spectators and volunteers before vanishing into the night. moving faster and looking stronger over the col than the previous two men, blanchard continued the chase in third 17 minutes back. miller and evans continued to work together to keep the gap manageable. the gap between walmsley and jornet stretched even further to 14 minutes by the sleepy swiss village of la fouly, 112 kilometers into the race. both men were running under course-record pace, and both looked calm and collected. still running strong into la fouly, blanchard kept the leaders within reach. but walmsley was committed to stretching the elastic on the field as much as he could, coming through champex-lac at 125 kilometers with 13 hours and 40 minutes on the race clock, gaining even more time on the course record and moving strongly. it’s generally a bad idea to bet against walmsley after he’s put his mind to something, and after a fifth-place finish in 2017 and dnf in 2018 and 2021 at utmb, his commitment to the race and move to europe to train on the trails seemed to be paying off. but walmsley is also known for going out fast and strong, and it doesn’t always stick."
"kilian jornet, 2022 utmb champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell one could argue that jornet was just biding his time, letting walmsley burn his matches out front. however, there were times around this point in the race when jornet just plain looked like he was working, enough so that we all began to wonder if the goat of trail running would have a crack in his armor today. however, by trient at 142 kilometers, jornet had decided to make his move, coming into the aid station in the lead. but instead of seeing walmsley behind him, it was a surging blanchard, less than a minute back, that jornet would have to now battle. it was a long 19 minutes before walmsley would arrive, appearing to be in discomfort. the dynamic duo of evans and miller continued to run together, still holding the gap to the race leader at just over 30 minutes, as they had for much of the race. as the kilometers ticked down, it was indeed a showdown between two men, except it was blanchard challenging jornet, with both men coming into vallorcine at 153 kilometers together, well ahead of the course-record pace. with walmsley slowly losing time to the leaders but still in third, eyes moved to evans who’d finally dropped miller after nearly a night and a day of racing side by side to see if he could make the pass. the 2022 utmb men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. mathieu blanchard, 1. kilian jornet, and 3. tom evans. photo: irunfar/bryon powell by this time, it felt nearly inevitable that jornet would run to the win and it was no surprise when he came into tete aux vents solo looking focused and fast with an 11-kilometer downhill run to the finish. blanchard never gave up the chase, seven minutes back, while evans passed a tired but “pumped” walmsley to slot into third for the first time. jornet would finish with a course-record time of 19:49:30, besting both françois d’haene’s 2014 record time (20:11:44) on a course that did not include the pyramides calcaires, a gnarly little climb and descent added to the utmb course a few years back, and capell’s 2019 time (20:19:09), which did include those extra kilometers. this is his fourth win at utmb. just five minutes back, blanchard would also come into the finishing chute under the previous course record in second place. an elated evans rounded out the podium, a stellar finish for his first utmb. walmsley came across the line in fourth, releasing the two dnf monkeys on his back and finishing the next step in his goal of ultimately winning this race someday. miller, no longer on the comeback trail following surgery and recovery, but fully back, crossed the line in fifth place. most of the back half of the men’s top 10 are runners who started slower and bided their time, moving up in the race’s second half, including france’sbeñat marmissolle, france’sarthur joyeux-bouillon,jonas russiof switzerland, and romania’srobert hajnal."
"the final member of the men’s top 10, however, is france’sthibaut garrivier, who went out hot and looked like he paid for it later, but ultimately held onto 10th place. arthur joyeux-bouillon on his way to seventh place at the 2022 utmb. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. the scene at the courmayeur aid station, about 80 kilometers into the 2022 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell an american living in france and eighth-place finisher at utmb in 2021,katie schide(pre– andpost-race interviews) set out to make her mark on the race from the beginning, leading the women’s field after seven kilometers into les houches while being trailed closely by the trio ofmarianne hogan(post-race interview) from canada,kaytlyn gerbin(post-race interview) from the usa, andhillary allenfrom the usa. schide grew the gap over the next 13 kilometers into saint-gervais. with only one hour and 48 minutes on the race clock, a truly raw opening effort, her lead over second place hogan was already five minutes, and she had eight minutes on third placeaudrey tanguy(pre-race interview) of france.jocelyne paulyandmanon bohard, both from france also, came through in fourth and fifth withmimmi kotka(pre-race interview), a swede living in chamonix, just behind them in sixth.fu-zhao xiang(pre-race interview) of china,ragna debats(pre-race interview), who is dutch but lives in spain, andazara garcía(pre-race interview) of spain rounded out the top 10, running together 13 minutes behind schide. mimmi kotka (left) and kaytlyn gerbin take in the scene at the 2022 utmb start line. hillary allen also looks on in the background. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein keeping up her consistent and strong pace, schide continued to increase her lead on the rest of the women’s field, coming into les contamines at 31 kilometers with 2:50 on the race clock. by then, she’d extended her lead on hogan to over nine minutes, tanguy to 12 minutes, and bohard and pauly to 15 minutes. tanguy was probably relieved to make it past les contamines where she had dropped last year from severe stomach cramps. a visibly limping kotka, who had challenged courtney dauwalter during last year’s utmb during the early miles of the race before finishing third as dauwalter won, came into les contamines nearly 20 minutes off the lead in sixth and would not continue. schide continued to smile coming through the col du bonhomme, at about a marathon’s distance into the race, clearly enjoying her run through the night and appreciating the cheers of the spectators. climbing one of the largest passes of the race only seemed to make her stronger. her gap to hogan and tanguy had grown to about 20 minutes as the two chasers crested the col. the cheers from the enthusiastic french crowd brought smiles to both women’s faces as they passed through. the cheers continued for bohard and pauly, who were still running together. katie schide, 2022 utmb champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the crowd at les chapieux, 50 kilometers in, was enthused to see schide, erupting in huge cheers as she came in."
"while the gaps between the women in second through 10th grew and shrunk over the kilometers, schide’s gap on the field had only gone one direction so far: up. she was now more than 22 minutes up on second place hogan. by the time schide got to lac combal, 66 kilometers into the race, the gap was up to 25 minutes, and it would be an additional 20 minutes for tanguy to arrive after that. with 80 kilometers run, schide came into courmayeur flying, spending only eight minutes at the aid station approximately halfway into the race. the crowds were thrilled to see her, providing a warm and raucous welcome as she ran into the aid station looking smooth. but for the first time in the race thus far, hogan had started to close the gap to the leader, whittling it down to just over 20 minutes. smiling but with a stomach that couldn’t handle gels anymore, she quickly drank a coke and opted for pizza for fuel. the gap between the top two women and the rest of the field continued to grow, and it was over an hour before tanguy, pauly, and gerbin ran through, and a few more minutes after them to the sixth woman,emily hawgood, of zimbabwe, who lives in the usa. marianne hogan taking second at the 2022 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell while schide had seemed unstoppable before courmayeur, the tables seemed to turn over the next 17 kilometers to arnouvaz as night turned to day. schide came in with stomach issues, clearly in a rough spot, with hogan hot on her heels, now only two minutes behind. closing a gap of more than 18 minutes is a feat to be acknowledged, and a feisty and strong hogan seemed energized by the coming of the day and the idea of leading the race for the first time. a struggling schide maintained her lead over the grand col ferret at 102 kilometers, but it was down to a minute, and when the women’s leader arrived at la fouly at 112 kilometers, it was hogan instead of schide for the first time, with a sizable six-minute gap. by champex-lac at 125 kilometers, it was still hogan in the lead and well under course record pace, now with a 10-minute gap to second. but schide wasn’t about to give up, slowing down to let her stomach recover from its previous rough spell, and finally eating a cheese sandwich and starting to move well again. one hundred miles is a long distance to race, long enough that runners can get through rough spells and rebound. and that’s exactly what schide did, regaining the lead in trient at kilometer 142, not only eliminating the 10-minute gap but putting an additional 10 minutes on hogan. by vallorcine at 153 kilometers, the gap between the top two was up to 41 minutes, with hogan nursing a hurt left leg."
"by the time the pair reached the finish line in chamonix, they maintained their one-two position with schide having extended the gap to some 75 minutes. it was another 35 minutes later that we saw the final member of the women’s podium arrive, gerbin, who ran for much of the second half of the race in what she described as “no woman’s land,” well in front of those behind her but out of contact with the lead. it was apparently a comfortable spot for her, though, as she held her position strongly, and crossed the finish line back in chamonix like she could run plenty more kilometers if needed. kaytlyn gerbin in the early hours of the 2022 utmb, where she took third. photo: irunfar/bryon powell pauly finished fourth, the successful conclusion of a focused day of racing.eszter csillag(post-race interview), who is from hungary but lives in hong kong, moved up later on to take fifth. emily hawgood ran strong all day to set and maintain a very similar position of sixth place. xiang held tight to seventh place with spain’s aroa sio just behind in eighth. italy’sfrancesca prettoandeva-maria spergerof germany moved up into the top 10 in the last 50 kilometers. full results. jocelyne pauly on her way to taking fourth at the 2022 utmb. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks thank you so much to irunfar’s utmb office team of marissa harris, olivia rissland, casey wyatt, and eszter horanyi. thank you also to all of the members of irunfar’s utmb field team, who hiked, ran, drove, and rode public transit all over the race course to report live, including kirsten kortebein, donielle wolfe, tulip, lincoln quillam, fabrice van de cauter, tom van de cauter, nahele van de cauter, runyarsæther, laura bakker, tim peeters, david orr, simon mawby, gina atwood, greta, andrea pedroni, paul gaymayer, elam king, jonathan lantz, nancy, barb, sarah brady, jason keith, and ian mcfarlane.we are so grateful to each of you! scenery at the 2022 utmb start line in chamonix, france, on friday, august 26, 2022. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein related articles:"

"the latest edition of theleadville 100 milehas wrapped for 2022, leaving a host of ultrarunners with bragging rights and shiny new belt buckles for their efforts. this event is among the most famous 100-mile trail races. runners make their way through the rocky mountains of colorado at elevations starting at 9,200 feet all the way up to thin-aired high point of hope pass at 12,508 feet. the extreme elevation and altitude make breathing difficult and add exponentially to the fatigue athletes feel as they make their way through the course. the race has been a staple of the ultrarunning community since its inception in 1983. this year, the customary shotgun blast sounded on saturday, august 20, 2022, at 4:00 a.m. local time. a slew of contenders from previous years left the starting line, includingclare gallagher, who won the only previous leadville 100 mile she had run, in 2016, as well asadrian macdonald, last year’s men’s champion. the leadville 100 mile trail race is known as the “race across the sky.” it features elevations of more than 12,500 feet and sweeping views of the colorado rockies. photo: life time adrian macdonaldturned heads in 2021 when he won the race as a first-time 100-mile competitor. it was clear from the start that macdonald was primed for a repeat win if he could hold it together. all of the top 10 runners stayed close together through the first few miles of the race. but as mile 30 approached, gaps began to develop in the pack, and leaders emerged who would keep pace in front throughout the rest of the day. at the halfway mark, macdonald had found the front of the pack and edged out a nearly 15-minute lead overtyler andrewsin second place. other racers includingjp giblin,ryan kaiser, andchristopher harringtonalso stood out in front. that group kept its distance from the field for the remainder of the race. but macdonald made consistent gains in the final quarter of the race that gave him a commanding lead coming into the finish. macdonald crossed the finish line more than two hours before anyone else. the race for the next three places stayed considerably tighter. giblin finished second with kaiser just about 14 minutes in tow. andrews came through about 20 minutes later, followed by harrington. adrian macdonald takes the win at the 2022 leadville 100 mile. photo: life time full results. back in 2016, boulder, colorado’s clare gallagher threatened to reset the leadville 100 mile course record in her first-ever 100-mile race. this year she came back to leadville for the first time since then — and won again. gallagher topped the women’s field after sparring intensely withaddie bracythroughout much of the run. gallagher and bracy were neck-and-neck at the first split, running at an 8:33 pace together with only nine seconds between them. the pair traded the lead for a couple of checkpoints, but bracy managed to pull ahead to gain about a six-minute lead on gallagher at the 50-mile mark."

"the last time irunfar covered spain’s legendaryzegama-aizkorri marathon, the runners in the field made it count. in 2017,stian angermund-vikandmaite maioraset the previous men’s and women’s course records, respectively, at 3:45:08 and 4:34:27. this year, the first race of the golden trail world series (gtws) promised no less excitement when the gun sounded at 9 a.m. central european time on may 29, 2022. and it delivered — the thinnest of margins separated the men’s leaders for the bulk of the race, and the dominant women’s leader set a record pace. after two years of cancellations due to covid-19, runners took off on the marathon-length course covering 8,876 feet of vertical climb. to say thefield was stackedwas like saying the sky is blue.kilian jornet(spain, lives in norway),maude mathys(switzerland),nienke brinkman(the netherlands, lives in switzerland),oriol cardona(spain),manuel merillas(spain), andcourtney dauwalter(usa) packed the grid, among others. it’s hard to imagine a more formulaic race, and the use of that adjective is not a knock. like the alpe d’huez climb in the tour de france, the course surges out into the thick of a 15,000-spectator throng crammed along its hyper-technical route. zegama is zegama, they say. verily. crowds of supporters lined the route for the 2022 zegama-aizkorri marathon. all photos: toño miranda you could saynienke brinkman’sfirst zegama was a good one. you could also say it was a historic one. brinkman ledmaude mathysby three minutes around the halfway point. that condition prevailed and the young dutchwoman ultimately defied expectations to beat mathys by over nine minutes and turn in a 4:16:43 to smash the existing course record by more than 18 minutes. brinkman never trailed in the race past the five-mile mark and ran almost the whole race alone, during a seasonreplete with headline performances. in her post-race interview, she said she came into the race underprepared. sure. it’s fair to say that brinkman, who has notched a 2:22 marathon performance and a zegama course record within the span of two months, is changing the sport of running as we type this. sara alonso(spain) rounded out the top three, 37 seconds behind mathys and well inside the previous course record. (in 2015, mathys received a warning without suspension from the disciplinary chamber for doping cases of swiss olympic for two positive tests for clomifene [previously clomiphene] after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a world anti-doping agency therapeutic use exemption.) nienke brinkman, the 2022 zegama-aizkorri marathon women’s champion. full results. the top-five women at the 2022 zegama-aizkorri marathon (l-to-r): 4. patricia pineda, 2. maude mathys, 1. nienke brinkman, 3. sara alonso, and 5. fabiola conti. kilian jornetanddavide magnini(italy) ran neck and neck — amazingly so — for over 14 miles on sunday. at the first checkpoint at 5.3 miles, jornet led magnini by a second. by the next one, 3.1 miles later, magnini had grabbed a one-second lead. the two ran side-by-side, never hitting a checkpoint more than two seconds apart, until jornet started to pull away during a steep descent in the race’s 16th mile."

"the sahara desert’smarathon des sables(mds) is as scorching as it is revered. after an october comeback last year following a 2.5-year covid-19-induced hiatus, the race returned to morocco again this march. temperatures well above 100 degrees fahrenheit and plenty of blistering sunshine are hallmarks of the seven-day, 155-mile desert stage race. finishing it — or simply running in it — is no joke. each year, race organizers deploy 120,000 liters of water, a support staff numbering in the hundreds, and a wide array of vehicles, aircraft, and even camels to monitor the action and keep runners safe. last year, brutal heat and a virulent stomach bugcaused an unusually high 40% dropout rate. in this edition, conditions in the field appear somewhat more stable. however, challenging desert weather still wreaked havoc at times throughout the week of racing. the 2022 marathon des sables started with fair weather on sunday, march 27. but high heat and howling wind beset the race’s second stage the next day. though only moderately long, stage 2 also negotiated plenty of steep terrain. the wild second stage scrambled runners, especially some perennial race favorites. eight-time mds winnerrachid el morabity(morocco) led the field coming out of stage 1 but lost 9 minutes during the marathon-length stage 2. he landed in third place behind his younger brother,mohamed el morabity, a first for the pair as mohamed has finished second in this race four times, and each behind his winning brother. mohamed maintained his lead — by a razor-thin margin of 37 seconds — through stage 4 on wednesday. on the women’s side, first-time marathon des sables entrantanna comet(spain) was untouchable. comet ran in a league of her own for the majority of the race, building a lead of up to 53 minutes by the end of stage 4.sylvaine cussot(france) set an equally solid course all week, generally finishing several minutes behind comet but well in front of the rest of the field, to hold in second place all week. the gun sounded at the 2022 marathon des sables’ fifth and final competitive stage on friday, april 1. the first finishers broke the tape in the early afternoon, moroccan local time. the final, noncompetitive stage 6 takes place on saturday, april 2. a beautiful sahara desert sunset during the 2022 marathon des sables. photo: cimbaly_mds2022@franckoddoux rachid el morabity stormed back to win, outpacing the rest of the field — and his younger brother — in the race’s final stage. mohamed led by around half a minute at all checkpoints on stage 5, but rachid overtook him late, and then pulled away. his marathon des sables dominance continues— it’s the ninth time he’s won the race. mohamed el morabity played second fiddle yet again. he claimed his fifth runner-up mds finish all-time. aziz yachou(morocco) was the only other runner to finish under 19 hours cumulatively. a strong stage 5, where he took second, left him 4 minutes back of rachid el morabity’s week-long pace."

"sustained speed was on full display at the 2021desert solstice track invitationalon saturday and sunday, december 11 and 12. the invite-only meet, taking place on a traditional track, brought together a fascinating combination of quick-footed trail and road specialists in the 24-hour and 100-mile event, and a number of those runners took home new american overall, track, and age group records, includingnick coury,camille herron, andpam smith. the weather was excellent, with temperatures ranging between 45 and 70 degrees fahrenheit and low humidity, during the late fall event in phoenix, arizona. though the aravaipa running race was open to spectators both in-person and onlive stream, just 25 elite runners participated, the event pitting them against the eternal question, “how far can i run in a day?” any ultramarathon of this length holds surprises, and the 2021 desert solstice was no exception. records were set, some runners finished at 100 miles or 200 kilometers into the event, and by the time it was all over, just three women and four men participated in the final hours of the 24-hour race. the top performance of the weekend goes tonick coury, who nabbed a new men’s american 24-hour record. previously held bymike mortonat 172.45 miles, coury ran a masterclass of a race to finish in 173.01 miles.he ran nearly every single lap under 2 minutes and 10 seconds, with a few at 2:20-plus sprinkled in there for refueling and bathroom breaks. incredibly, his last eight laps were under 2:00, and his last few at or under 1:30 – that’s six-minutes-per-mile pace! coury also won the 2020 desert solstice 24 hour by posting 155 miles. a post shared by aravaipa running (@aravaiparunning) another record fell on the men’s side this weekend, this time byjacob jackson. jackson, who came in second in the 24-hour race with 157.33 miles, set a men’s american 40-to-44 age group record for 200 kilometers. he broke it handily, coming in at 17:51:17, beating the previous 18:00:12 record by nearly nine minutes. the final two men who stayed in the 24-hour race werescott traer, who finished with 152.36 miles, andmatthew urbanski, who clocked 131.77 miles. david laneywas the one to watch for the men’s 100-mile race, and he surpassed that distance faster than everyone else, clocking 12:34:59. full results. the winner of the women’s 24-hour race wasmarisa lizakin 140.18 miles. lizak ran a gutsy race: she was on a great pace for the first 265 laps, with all of her laps under a 2:10. after about 87 miles, her pace gradually declined, and it was clear she was gritting through a lot of pain. lizak was seen limping around the track for the last few hours and collapsed to the ground after her 24-hour victory. coming in second for the 24-hour race,jian springerset women’s american 50-to-54 age group records for 24 hours with 135.17 miles, 100 miles in 16:36:11, and 200 kilometers in 21:41:31. mandie holmeswas the third and final woman standing in the 24-hour race, finishing with 133.67 miles."

"at midnight on saturday, november 20, the 2021madeira island ultra-trail(miut) started from the coastal village of porto moniz on the island’s northwest coast, and headed uphill into the night. some 14-plus hours of steep, technical, and often slippery trails later, interspersed with flat running along roads and the island’s famous levada trails (the pathways next to irrigation ditches), race leaders made their way out of the high country and down to the finish line in the port city of machico, on the island’s southeast coast. all told, runners traveled 115 kilometers (72 miles) and climbed 7,200 meters (23,600 feet). with that midnight start and the seven hours of night running that followed, runners experienced cold temperatures in the high terrain as well as more temperate conditions down low. dawn broke on saturday morning to clear skies, in both the low and high country. in the afternoon, as the leaders traveled the race’s final 20 kilometers at low altitude, the temperature rose but was moderated by cloud cover, fog, and even a couple rain showers. despite cool temperatures, runners reported feeling the effects of the high humidity. all in all, the weather was quite good for race day. this course played to the strengths of vert-loverhillary allen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and she leaned into it to exact a commanding women’s win. allen stayed in the lead virtually all race, and while the gap was as large as 40 minutes and as small as nine, allen’s fitness shined. after a long journey to health following a near-fatal fall several years ago and its residual effects on her body, allen’s win was a sweet one. hannes namberger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) blew everyone out of the water in the men’s race, finishing first in 14:00:36, and over 40 minutes ahead of his second-place competitor. while namberger was among the lead men all race, he didn’t make substantial gains on the rest of the field until the climb to the highest points of the race after halfway. but then, he simply ran away with it, and scored the biggest win of his trail running and ultrarunning career yet. the start of the 2021 madeira island ultra-trail. all photos: irunfar/bryon powell though the women’s race had a smaller lead pack and fewer switcheroos than the men’s, which we’ll learn about later in this article, it was exciting and down to the wire nonetheless. americanhillary allen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) moved into the lead by the top of the first major climb at fanal, 14 kilometers into the race. she is well known for her climbing abilities and her prowess showed throughout this course as she continued to build a lead from there to the 42-kilometer mark. russia’sekaterina mityaeva(post-race interview) also ran strong from the start. though she was solidly behind allen throughout the first half of the race, she also consistently gained time on the rest of the field through halfway."

"at fanal, 14 kilometers into the race and at the top of the first major climb, the top-11 men ran within one minute of each other, and even more trailed behind in a long train of chasers. by the bottom of that descent, however, at chão da ribiera, 23 kilometers into the race, the lead pack was cut down to only six. things got a little more interesting around rosario at 42 kilometers, after yet another brutal climb and descent. here, three men shared the lead: norwegianerik-sebastian krogvig, france’sbeñat marmissolle, and germany’shannes namberger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). they headed into the next two more gradual climbs with italy’sdaniel jungand france’shugo deckhot on their tails. hannes namberger on his way to winning the 2021 madeira island ultra-trail. up until this point, runners were still traversing the island in the dark. the men spent some time reeling each other in or dropping off in the high country as the sun began to rise, and as they rolled into one of the lower points of the course at curral das freiras, the 60-kilometer mark, the fatigue and effort began to show. namberger and marmissolle managed to hang on to each other in the lead, and asked the crowd how close third place was behind them. krogvig came in soon after, despondent about a twice-rolled ankle that would eventually mean an early end to his day. early pace pushers jung and deck also dropped from the race. switzerland’sjean-philippe tschumi(post-race interview) rolled in right behind and was only 10.5 minutes off the lead in third. the ever-smilingdmitri mityaev(post-race interview) of russia came in only two minutes behind tschumi in fourth, and began another big climb looking very fresh. another russian,aleksei tolstenko, came in after to round out the top five. dmitry mityaev, all smiles as always, on pico do arieiro. the climb from curral das freiras to the high country gains about 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) in only 10 kilometers. this climb to pico ruivo, the high point of the course and the whole of madeira island, and then the traverse to pico do arieiro is extremely technical and completely blew apart the men’s field. on the climb alone, namberger gained an eight-minute lead on then second-place marmissolle. we got to see runners on pico do arieiro, the 76 kilometer mark, and nearly all of them said some version of “this is really hard” – or at least looked like they were thinking it. from here, the course descends way down, and the field stretched out even more until we saw runners once again at portela at 99 kilometers. at this point the course is extremely runnable, and it was clear who had legs to cruise and who didn’t. in a bit of a switch up, marmissolle wasn’t to be seen in the top five: mityaev had made up a huge amount of time and was in second, tschumi was only a few minutes back, tolstenko just behind him, and romania’srobert hajnalhad cracked into the top five."
"and with a long downhill route to the finish, peppered with flat stretches, namberger put a huge gap on the field to win, all smiles, in 14:00:36. second through fifth positions held to the finish as well, though mityaev and tschumi leap frogged each other several times before sorting back out to second and third respectively. jean-philippe tschumi puts in the effort on the ascent to pico do areeio at 76 kilometers. full results.

"the 19th edition of thejavelina jundred milekicked off saturday morning, october 30, sending runners through five grueling loops of arizona desert trail totaling 100 miles, just in time for halloween. the javelina jundred starts at the mcdowell mountain regional park, north of fountain hills, arizona, about an hour outside of phoenix. runners took off at 6 a.m. on a 22.3-mile loop including the escondido trail on the park’s far eastern side, and then four consecutive 19.45-mile loops that combine the pemberton, shallmo, and cinch trails. the 100-mile race served as a 2022western states 100golden ticket race, earning automatic entry for the top-two male and female runners. a cool, dark start yielded hot daytime temperatures before night brought cool reprieve once again, with daytime highs cresting above 85 degrees fahrenheit. as is the case each year, the aravaipa running race organization hosted a huge halloween party that went all day saturday, though the night, and into the race’s closing hours on sunday morning. the 2021 javelina jundred mile scene. photo: javelina jundred camille herroncame out of the gate at a screaming pace and kept it up throughout all 100 miles of the javelina jundred. by the 22-mile mark, herron had pulled out a nearly 10-minute lead, which she built upon throughout the race. herron crossed the finish line at 14:03:23, more than 90 minutes in front of the nearest chaser.brittany petersonfinished second at 15:47:23. peterson stayed within 30 minutes of herron for more than half of the race. but after 61 miles, herron began steadily gaining on the field at a pace that no one could match. it appears herron set a huge new course record by nearly 50 minutes as well. tessa chesserandlotti zeilerran a close race for third and fourth. zeiler stayed in front for the first 5o miles. after that, she and chesser battled with each other for the lead for 20 miles until chesser began to break away at around 70 miles. chesser maintained her lead for the race, finishing at 16:25:05. zeiler finished about 25 minutes later at 16:50:12. melissa brizicrounded out the top five, quite a bit back in 18:25:26. while herron earned golden ticket entry to the 2022 western states 100, peterson already has an entry courtesy of her top-10 finish at the race’s 2021 edition. the golden ticket, thus, rolled down to third-place chesser. women’s top-five finishers: full results. camille herron on her way to winning the 2021 javelina jundred mile. photo: javelina jundred arlen glickwas first across the finish line at 13:14:51.ryan montgomeryfinished second at 13:33:52, just under 20 minutes behind. glick and montgomery ran a close race from the start. glick carved out a narrow lead at the beginning of the race that he held for the first 20 or so miles. by mile 22, montgomery closed the gap and pressed ahead by several seconds. however, glick was back in front by mile 32. montgomery was still able to regain the lead for a short time as the pair approached the 40-mile mark."

"the 2021grand trail des templiersstarted with its typical red flares and music blazing into a frosty, dark, october morning — this year perhaps buoyed by the extra energy of the race’s three-year absence due to bad weather and the covid-19 pandemic. this 81 kilometer (50-mile) event, which takes place in millau, france, climbs some 3,690 meters (12,100 feet) but does so over largely runnable terrain. the event has long attracted international competition as well as many of its home nation’s trail stars. this combination results in a really fast race with dynamic competition between runners from start to finish. this year saw just-below-freezing temperatures and clear skies for the 5:15 a.m. start. soon after dawn, it became an outrageously perfect fall day in southern france. afternoon temperatures reached about 16 degrees celsius (62 degrees fahrenheit), literally perfect running weather. the u.k.’sjonathan albon(post-race interview) won the men’s race by seven minutes, but he put five of those minutes on second place in the race’s final 11k, so the men’s race for the podium was really tight for the majority of the race – nearly 70k – before spreading out a bit at the end. this was albon’s debut at les templiers. new zealand’sruth croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took the race out easy, moved up into the lead mid-race, and distanced herself significantly from the rest of the field late to earn her second win of les templiers. thanks tovert.runfor sponsoring our coverage of les templiers. the start of the 2021 grand trail des templiers. photo: irunfar/bryon powell les templiers is always a fast-moving race — blink and you’ll miss it — and this year was no exception. as far as 35 kilometers into the race, the top-eight men were still running within a minute of each other! but let’s back up to the beginning. when we spotted the leaders at 10k, 21k, and 35k, it was the usual suspects up front, including two-time defending championsébastien spehler(pre-race interview) of france, the u.k.’sjonathan albon(post-race interview) androbbie simpson,petter engdahlof sweden, as well as france’ssebastien capus. also there, but at the back of this group, was multi-time second-place finishernicolas martin(pre-race interview) of france going out a little easier in his trademark style. the early men’s leaders of the 2021 les templiers. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at 49k, it was still a tight race for the top-six men, where they passed us within six minutes of each other. martin had crept up into third position at this point, with only albon and spehler ahead of him. things were shaping up for a very interesting last 30k of racing for the concentrated group in the men’s field. at 70k, and with 11k of the course’s most challenging terrain left to run, albon led the field by just over two minutes. he didn’t stop at the aid station, asked about how close behind his second-place competitor was, and charged ahead. it seemed he might have reason to worry as spehler was right behind and also moving well."
"now, enter france’sbenoît cori, who had moved up from the second half of the top 10 into podium position; like spehler, cori’s a two-time les templiers champion. jonathan albon, 2021 les templiers champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell but albon excels on technical terrain, and the burly final 11k was his bread and butter. he continued to gap the field until he crossed the finish line back in millau as the 2021 champion in his debut at les templiers. spehler and cori held their positions to complete the men’s podium. martin ran a strong race all day, finishing his ninth run of les templiers in fourth place. engdahl rounded out the men’s top five, in what also looked like solid start-to-finish effort. sebastien spehler on his way to second place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell benoît cori seems stoked to take third at the 2021 les templiers. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. benedikt hoffmann moved up into the men’s top 10 late in the race. photo: vert.run/kirsten kortebein it was not a surprise to anyone who follows trail and ultrarunning that spain’sgemma arenas(pre-race interview) was the women’s pacesetter for most of the race’s first 35 kilometers. in fact, i think we all might have been concerned if she wasn’t there. it looked like arenas was putting in a solid effort to run in the lead. at 10k into the race, where we got our first glimpse of the field as they flew through the dark forest, immediately behind arenas were frenchwomenjulie rouxandfiona porte. also in the mix for about the top-seven women through 21k were 2017 les templiers championruth croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of new zealand and south africa’smeg mackenzie(pre-race interview), both taking what looked like a more relaxed start. ruth croft, 2021 les templiers champion. photo: vert.run/kirsten kortebein at 35k into the race, however, things changed. here, croft, who looked ridiculously chill, moved up to take over the race lead. arenas and roux settled into second and third positions immediately behind her, which they would both hold through the finish line. just 14k later, at 49k, croft was a full six minutes up on any other woman, having created a significant gap, which stayed the same over the next 21k. but in the race’s final 11k, croft broke fully away from the rest of the field, moving efficiently over the course’s most burly section. when she crossed the finish line for the win back in millau, it was a long 20 minutes until second place arrived. while arenas seemed to slow a bit over the last 11k, roux charged hard both on the steep uphills and downhills. with 11k to run, arenas held a 6.5-minute lead on roux, but by the finish, her lead had shrunk to just 80 seconds. give these women another two kilometers to race and things would have ended up mighty interesting. but close only counts in horseshoes, so arenas held for second place while roux took third."

"after a 2.5-year break due to the covid-19 pandemic, it was with great anticipation that the 2021marathon des sablestook place this week. the famous desert race, which runs in the sahara desert of morocco, travels 155 miles (250 kilometers) over seven days, traversing sand dunes and stone-filled plains in an arid climate where midday temperatures easily reach 120 degrees fahrenheit (48 degrees celsius). each day, a mobile bivouac is erected in the desert, which serves as the day’s finish line, campground for the night, and the following day’s starting line. there are six stages total, and five of them are competitive stages. the final stage is an untimed charity stage. participants must carry their own equipment including food, camping materials, and survival gear along with water rations supplied by the race organization. typically, the race takes place in april, which is spring in the sahara desert. this october edition was said to be hotter and drier than usual for this race and this time of the year. in addition to the heat, a stomach virus ravaged many of the participants. by the end of the week, dropouts amounted to over 40% of all starters, an unusually high rate for this particular race. sadly, the race claimed the life of one runner due to cardiac arrest. the french man, in his 50s, was an experienced ultrarunner who had met the medical requirements necessary to start the race. irunfarcovered this storyearlier in the week. for the first three days of the 2021 edition, it looked like parity might define the race. moroccan brothersrachid el morabityand the youngermohamedel morabityran close together, leading the rest of the men’s field by just minutes. on the women’s side, morocco’saziza rajiheld a bigger, but not insurmountable, half-hour lead overaicha omrani(france) andhassna hamdouch(morocco) in second and third. the stage was set for shakeups in the grueling 50-mile stage 4. however, raji and the el morabity brothers were about to render the outcome academic. at the end of stage 4, just 15 minutes separated rachid and mohamed el morabity from each other in first and second overall — but the rest of the field lagged behind by over an hour. meanwhile, raji had built her lead over the women’s field from less than an hour to a mind-boggling four-plus hours. scenery at the 2021 marathon des sables. photo: cimbaly_mds2021@foddoux in the end, rachid el morabity took the win, finishing with a time of 21:17:32. mohamed took a narrow second in 21:32:12, less than 15 minutes behind his older brother. this marks rachid el morabity’s eighth win of this iconic sand race, and mohamed el morabity’s fourth 2nd place behind his brother. merile robert(france) was the lone non-moroccan on the men’s podium, a position with which he’s familiar. this marks his fifth marathon des sables finish, with his top previous finish also third behind the el morabity brothers in 2018. aziz yachou(morocco) took fourth place, less than two minutes out of podium position, in what was an incredible breakout performance."

"this year’sutmbsaw a french sweep on the men’s side and a new course record on the women’s side.françois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of france won the men’s race, his fourth win of utmb, and the usa’scourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) topped the podium for the women, breaking the women’s record, previously held byrory bosio, set on a shorter course in 2013. the 171.5-kilometer (106.5-mile) race makes a beautiful yet brutal loop around the alps with mont blanc at the center, passing through france, italy, and switzerland, while beginning and ending at chamonix, france. starting with 2,347 runners at 5 p.m. on friday, august 27, just a bit smaller of a field than normal, the crowd was just as huge, with spectators ecstatic at the return of one of the most competitive trail ultramarathons in the world after a covid-19-induced hiatus in 2020. in a race with near-perfect weather conditions, competitors did not have to contend with the rain, hail, and high winds that sometimes plague the high mountain passes. d’haene and dauwalter were both dominant, each leading their respective events for more than half of the race after steadily moving up from the gun. but it was a race of attrition for many, which saw multiple high-profile racers drop out, includingjim walmsley,xavier thévenard(pre-race interview),tim tollefson(pre-race interview),dmitry mitayev,tom owens(pre-race interview),beth pascall,maite maiora(pre-race interview),audrey tanguy, andragna debats, many of them dropping out in the middle of the night as fatigue and the cumulative effect of difficult terrain set in. this was also a race of incredible breakout and solid perseverance in front of the challenges of 100 miles. the balance of the men’s podium saw breakout performances fromaurélien dunand-pallaz(post-race interview)andmathieu blanchard(post-race interview). and on the women’s podium was emerging starcamille bruyas(post-race interview) in second and the ever-strongmimmi kotka(post-race interview) in third. with the rest of this article, we’ll dive deep into how the men’s and the women’s races played out. you can also check out our2021 utmb photo galleryfor another look at the event. a special thanks toaltrafor making our coverage of utmb possible! thanks also tosquirrel’s nut butterandbufffor their support of our utmb coverage. the saint-gervais aid station during the 2021 utmb. all photos: irunfar with one of the most competitive line-ups in utmb history, this year’s race could have been anyone’s game. though a few high profile women did not start, the race was still full of talent. with previous champions, veteran talent, and new-to-utmb-ers, this race could have been a close one. but as we see time and again in 100-mile races, stomachs are unpredictable, small niggles turn into major injuries, and the mountainous terrain over 20-plus hours can derail the healthiest runners with even the best preparation. that’s exactly what happened in the 2021 women’s utmb. there was a huge number of high profile dropouts, the majority happening in the safety of the large courmayeur checkpoint, at about 81 kilometers, a little less than halfway into the race. these eliminations allowed a number of other women to step up, leading to a number of great performances from previously lesser-known competitors."
"the lead pack of women start to spread out at les houches, eight kilometers into the 2021 utmb. the first 50 kilometers of the race were fairly relaxed and uneventful. by the time the women rolled into les houches, they had settled into their comfort zones and were mentally preparing for the long day ahead.courtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), in her classic style, was out front, only a minute behind the men’s lead pack, and third through eighth places were only 90 seconds behind her. this pack included the american living in francekatie schide(pre-race interview), france’scamille bruyas(post-race interview),beth pascall(pre-race interview) of the u.k.,audrey tanguy(pre-race interview) of france, andragna debats(pre-race interview) who is dutch but lives in spain. by the 20-kilometer mark, the swede living in chamonixmimmi kotka(post-race interview) had moved up to join them. coming into the 31-kilometer mark at les contamines, kotka entered before dauwalter, but the latter had a shorter aid-station stop, quickly refilling her pack and moving on. bruyas was also under the shelter at the same time, making short work of her refuel. fourth- through 10th-place women were all within eight minutes of the lead, still a very tight race. this aid station marked the first significant and emotional moment of the day, tanguy was suffering severe stomach cramps, and dropped from the race here. after dodging a traffic jam of goats and pushing through dense fog, the women summited one of the largest passes of the day, col du bonhomme, 43 kilometers into the race. dauwalter continued to lead with kotka close behind. this is when the field started to stretch out a bit, with bruyas about 11 minutes back, and france’smarion delespierrein 10th, about 19 minutes back. it was clear the strain the previous climb of 1,160 meters (3,800 feet) had taken a toll on some. now well into the night, runners’ headlamps lit up the mountainside as they descended to the 50-kilometer mark at les chapieux. now past the marathon distance and starting the next big climb, it was here that runners needed to summon their focus and fortitude. third-place finisher mimmi kotka powers through the night after a fall. dauwalter and kotka continued to run a tight and fast race, both looking chill and composed in lac combal at 66 kilometers into the adventure, by this point over 20 minutes ahead of bruyas and anyone else. deslespierre andluzia buehlerof switzerland moved steadily, but others were suffering —hillary allendropped out of the race near here, though it’s unclear why. most made it up and over the mount favre summit after that, but after the long and steep descent, many decided to call it a day in the safe haven of courmayeur, a little less than halfway into the race. notable drops here included pascall,brittany peterson,kelly wolf, andfrancesca canepa, whose ailments ranged from a turned stomach to straight-up exhaustion. other women took extended aid-station stops, including dauwalter, who spent over six minutes here."
"running over one of the tallest points of the course, grand col ferret, at just over 102 kilometers, runners once again had to push through thick fog, donning jackets,hats, andglovesto keep their core warm over the high-elevation pass. by this time, kotka had given significant space to dauwalter, trailing 17 minutes back, but still looking very comfortable. dauwalter never really throws down a dramatic pace, but she is like a freight train. she gains momentum and just moves up steadily, further and further the longer the race, and her experience is very apparent after the 100-kilometer mark of nearly every race she runs — including this year’s utmb. coming into champex-lac, some 125 kilometers into the race leaving less than 50 kilometers left to run, dauwalter was now in the top 10 overall, the course record well within her reach. from here on out, the places and distance between top women stayed relatively the same, with notable drops fromailsa macdonald, who had been running very strong in the top 10 for much of the race, anddelphine avenier. by trient, as runners loped past the pretty pink church, bruyas came closer to kotka, who herself was now one hour back from dauwalter. bruyas looked comfortable, while kotka looked like she was already in a decent amount of pain from her knees, which were bloodied sometime before 66 kilometers into the race. though there were two major climbs left, it seemed by now the top-five places were set: delespierre in fourth was two hours back from the lead, and buehler in fifth another 45 minutes back from her. 2021 utmb winner, now two-time champion, courtney dauwalter runs to the finish line. while there were no surprises in the end, it was a gritty finish for many. dauwalter ran down the packed streets of chamonix to huge cheers from the crowd – and for good reason. finishing in an amazing 22:30:54, she ran the fastest time by a woman on the full course, a record previously set in 2013 byrory bosio, on a course three kilometers shorter, and without the pyramides calcaires climb in italy. dauwalter was all smiles, striding into her historic finish. bruyas followed her an hour and a half later, with a bit of a limp but also smiling, holding back tears in an emotional finish. kotka followed another hour after that, limping in obvious pain, but finishing with extreme grit and grace. to round out the top five, delespierre and buehler — the latter a big surprise as she wasn’t on our pre-race radar for such a high level performance — both had great races. just like in the back half of the men’s top 10, that of the women’s was super dynamic, with women constantly coming and going from the group from start to finish. when all 171.5 kilometers had passed, it was france’smaryline nakacheandlucie jamsinin sixth and seventh, schide in eighth,claudia trempsfrom spain in ninth, and the zimbabwean living in the u.s.emily hawgoodin 10th. camille bruyas clasps her hands together in an emotional second-place finish at the 2021 utmb."
"full results. luzia buehler worked her way steadily throughout the day, gaining time and places, eventually finishing fifth. the 2021 utmb men’s race started like every edition of this event: a huge group of men go off like a rocket and run it out together for the flat to rolling eight kilometers to chamonix’s neighbor village, les houches. call it a warm-up, call it settling the nerves, call it a little road race, call it whatever you want, but it’s always fun to watch. and sure enough, some 30 minutes after the start, the men’s train steamrolled through les houches and headed for the hills. while this race would certainly become controlled and then dominated byfrançois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), there were some early and middle players who kept this race entertaining from the start. enter the likes of spaniardjordi gamito, russia’sdmitry mityaev(pre-race interview), australianmorgan pilley, peruvianremigio huaman, americanjim walmsley(pre-race interview), and — get this — eventual second-place finisheraurélien dunand-pallaz(post-race interview) of france. a huge pack of men run into les houches, eight kilometers into the 2021 utmb. all photos: irunfar early on, it seemed that several of these men took turns in the lead and setting the pace. but as early pacesetting in a 100 miler goes, well, let’s just say that it doesn’t always go. and, in this case, all of the men on this list save for dunand-pallaz were dnfs by halfway through the event. of all these runners, it was walmsley who hung closest to the front the longest, running in second through nearly 90 kilometers into the event before dropping back and out of the race entirely. it will be interesting to hear walmsley’s take on his day, because from the outside looking in, he seemed so much more calm and tempered this year than in previous editions, and that made him seem like a contender for the win. however, there was that helluva’ run at the 2021 western states 100 two months ago and the injury he dealt with before that, as well as a host of other possible issues in the 100-mile distance. breakout second-place finisher aurélien dunand-pallaz runs through the night. so when everything shook out sometime after halfway through the race, there was d’haene putting on yet another masterclass performance in running mountain 100 milers. over the race’s middle third, he built a small lead on his chasers that going into the end of the event, which was neither added to nor subtracted from in any meaningful way. we’ve seen and written this with d’haene so many times before: he breaks a lead and then moves with the necessary efficiency needed to maintain it. it sounds so simple, but anyone who runs 100 milers knows it isn’t. this is a honed skill."
"in his pre-race interview with us, he said that he runs utmb when he feels the passion for it, which helps to explain the gaps between his showings here in2012,2014,2017, and 2021. quite honestly, that passion was on full display at the finish line, where the sometimes reserved d’haene let his smile open into a huge grin and where he embraced his family and friends as well as his many fans in celebration. it seems like these big 100 milers always have a breakout story, and this race has two of them in the men’s second- and third-place finishers, dunand-pallaz andmathieu blanchard(post-race interview) who is from france but who lives in canada. while their end results were similar, the pair took different trails to success. for dunand-pallaz, it was pressing early, very close to the leaders. and for blanchard, it looked like intentionally sitting back for the first marathon, letting the hot starters take it out, and waiting for the field to come back to him. around the marathon mark, blanchard slipped into the top 10, where he’d stay for the balance of the race. at the finish line, many miles and much effort later, the joy each showed for their breakout performance was a pleasure to watch. mathieu blanchard finishing third at the 2021 utmb. what can we say about fourth-place finisher and first master, france’sludovic pommeret? the2016 utmb championis now 46 years of age and he was absolute magic to watch. for the race’s first half, he did some grade-a lurking, hanging out between 11th and 20th places, always within reach of the top 10. there seemed to be a few spells throughout the race where he looked a little rough, but then he came back each time. starting around halfway, he made his way into the top 10 and stayed there for the balance of the race. picture-perfect racing! another frenchman in the top five, and this time it’sgermain grangierwho returned from his tie for ninth place in 2019 to nab a top-five spot for 2021. grangier’s strategy felt evident from the start: get out, stay mixed up with those leading or close to it, and hang there as long as possible. i loved wondering each time we saw him if he was going to hold his higher positioning in the field this year over the last race edition, and he even gave us a bit of a stir where he starting dropping back in the race’s final third. though he may have run as high as second place at times, he ultimately finished fifth. the back half of the men’s top 10 was ever dynamic, shifting over and over again. in the end, it was germany’shannes nambergerin sixth, france’sgregoire curmerand switzerland’sdiego pazostied for seventh, france’smathieu clémentin ninth, and hong kong’sho chung wongin 10th. 2021 utmb champion françois d’haene raises his fist in celebration. full results. tenth-place finisher ho chung wong celebrates at the finish line of the 2021 utmb. thank you so much to irunfar’s utmb office team of alex potter, marissa harris, and ellie greenwood."

"after a year’s hiatus, the big dance, the 2021western states 100, was back for its 100-mile journey on the historic western states trail in california. for many runners, it was the first time since the start of the covid-19 pandemic to line up with a deep and competitive field, and relative fitness levels were unknown. some racers had made a point of trying to run a spring tune-up race, while others used the break from racing as an opportunity to focus on long training blocks with only strava runs as indicators of their form. based on the competitive and exciting racing by both the women and the men, neither form nor racing memory suffered from the pandemic. the lack of snow in the high country set the course up for a fast run this year, but the heat played certain spoiler. what began as a mild day in the higher reaches of the sierra nevada turned into a broiler afternoon with the official high temperature on the course soaring above 100 degrees fahrenheit. in the end, it was the u.k.’sbeth pascall(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andjim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) who weathered the elements better than everyone else, taking home respective victories. in the women’s race, third-placeragna debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) set an incredible new masters course record by over half an hour, breakingann trason’srecord which had stood for 19 years. but this year’s race was a story for the ages in so many more ways, so let’s dig in. a special thanks todrymaxfor once again making our coverage of the western states 100 possible! thanks also tobuff®andhoka one onefor their support of our western states coverage. for a bit more before we get to irunfar’s post-race interviews, we’ve published finishing and finish-line race-organization interview videos with thewomen’s podiumandmen’s podiumfinishers. if you enjoyed our weeks of western states coverage and our in-depth reporting from the course, please consider supporting irunfar. whether it’sa reccurring monthly pledgeora one-time contribution, your support is invaluable in helping us do what we do! with three women inside the top-10 overall, some of the fastest times ever run on the course despite high heat, and tight competition wire to wire, the top-10 women changedwestern states 100history—and women’s ultrarunning history—this weekend. numerous international women chose to make the trip to the states for states. among them werebeth pascall(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) from the u.k., who’d spent the past 10 weeks in the u.s. after running thecanyons 100k.ragna debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who is from the netherlands but who lives in spain, was present, running her first western states, as wasruth croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), all the way from new zealand, lining up for her first attempt at 100 miles. on the domestic side, defending championclare gallagher(pre-race interview),brittany peterson(pre-race interview),addie bracy,camille herron, and so many more women all hoped to have a good run. what ensued was tight racing from start to end with impressive performances all around. beth pascall leading the women at robinson flat (mile 30). all photos: irunfar the race started under clear skies, a setting moon, and a comfortable 53 degrees fahrenheit."
"fast out of the gate, france’saudrey tanguywas the first over the escarpment, mile 3.5, followed a minute back by herron. gallagher, pascall, and bracy filled out the top five just two minutes back from tanguy. all the women received enthusiastic encouragement from the resident yeti of olympic valley who’d come out to spectate. by red star ridge at mile 15, pascall had moved to the front. after finishing just off the podium in fourth in 2019, she was eager to move up in the final standings and wasted no time making her intentions known. tanguy, bracy, and gallagher gave chase, all within 90 seconds, and a long string of women trailed just as closely behind. by robinson flat at mile 30, we understood that pascall meant business. looking relaxed, she’d moved to just three minutes off of course-record pace. bracy and debats continued to chase, holding the gap to within five minutes. in the next eight miles, pascall went from three minutes over record pace to nine minutes under it. she flew in and out of the dusty corners aid station at mile 38 in a minute. keely henninger, ruth croft, and brittany peterson running through robinson flat. halfway through, many of the top women were looking comfortable. pascall even claimed that it didn’t feel too hot. still, the heat must have been affecting her as she slowly lost some time on course-record pace. debats continued a steady march forward, keeping the gap at a manageable size.katie asmuth(post-race interview), now running in third, received the award for the happiest runner through midway, and the one with the sunhatwith the most flair. by mile 61, pascall had worked herself into 10th overall, but the full group of top-10 women were running within about 45 minutes of each other. and at 10.5 hours in, there were 19 women in the overall top 40, a testament to the depth and talent in the field. at mile 71, along the infamous cal street, the race was on. pascall came through at 11:51, moving up to ninth overall with a fast transition. at just 14:15 back, debats barely stopped at the aid station. two minutes later, asmuth ran through, only grabbing ice. croft followed less than four minutes in arrears, and peterson came through flying two minutes later. tanguy left a mere four minutes after that. count them! that’s six women within 27 minutes of each other almost three quarters of the way through a 100 miler. what, what? in the next 14 miles, croft made her move, coming through auburn lake trails, mile 85, in second, just 18 minutes down on pascall, but only a mere two minutes up on determined dabats. a charging peterson moved by asmuth. with the top-six women still within 45 minutes of each other at mile 85, there was plenty of racing to be done in the final miles. but no one could stop pascall. consistent from olympic valley to auburn, she finished in 17:10:41, the second-fastest time in women’s history."
"she was also seventh overall, continually moving up through the field as the day wore on. croft finished a strong second in the women’s field and ninth overall with a time of 17:33:48. debats would hold on to finish third with a time of 17:41:13, putting three women into the top-10 overall. at 42 years of age, debats’s incredible finish time marks a new women’s masters record, breaking the previous record of of 18:16:26, set byann trasonin 2002. ragna debats with her daughter after finishing third at the 2021 western states 100. this trio was followed by peterson and asmuth rounding out the top-five women. for the balance of the women’s top 10, sixth place was ultimately tanguy, her first western states finish. this year, seventh place belongs toemily hawgood, the zimbabwean who lives in the u.s., and who has a charmer of a story. hawgood ran three golden ticket races to gain western states entry this year, achieving it on that third try. in eighth wascamelia mayfield, who follows up on her fifth-place finish in 2019 with another smartly run race in this gnarly year.keely henningergains the f9 bib in her debut 100 miler, and 10th place belongs to none other thankaci lickteig(pre-race interview), whose finish marks her seventh at this event. together these 10 women finished within the top-21 overall. let’s just pause a moment to let that significance soak in. and to bring this full circle, gallagher and herron crossed the line outside of the top 10, in 17th and and 26th respectively, having what had to have been individual vision quests of sorts. and bracy threw in the towel at mile 62. full results. it would have taken a lot to convince most everyone to bet againstjim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) this year. and yet some of us still somehow did, because walmsley took an unconventional path to 2021 success. but we all should have known better. with many of the international men choosing not to make the trip over the various ponds, it was going to be a showdown of domestic talent. listening to walmsley talk before the race, it was clear he was in a good place mentally and physically. an it band injury in the spring may have cut down on his training volume, but in the end, it may have ended up being a blessing in disguise. he went into the race with the experience of two previous well-executed states performances, and he surely drew on that knowledge to put together a smart and measured race from start to finish. jim walmsley leading the race at michigan bluff (mile 55). hayden hawks(pre-race interview), on the other hand, was making just his second attempt at the 100-mile distance. but after setting a course record at thejfk 50 milelast fall and a solid block of training leading up to western states, he was out to race and win.jared hazen(pre-race interview) was hoping that fourth time would be the charm for western."
"after a third and a second in previous years, he hoped that a training block that started in february would deliver wining results. it didn’t take walmsley long to make it the 3.5 miles up to the escarpment. he was accompanied by hawks and followed closely by hazen. this order was entirely unsurprising given that all three men had the confidence to try to win the race. early on at red star ridge at mile 15, hawks and walmsley were already running three minutes under record pace, the lack of snow clearly saving them time. hazen followed in third two minutes back with other race favoritestim tollefson(pre-race interview),matt daniels(pre-race interview), andmark hammondclose on his heels. just under an hour later at duncan canyon, walmsley and hawks had pushed the pace another four minutes under record pace, both running smooth at 24 miles in. by robinson flat at mile 30, walmsley’s pace had become too much for hawks. he passed through five minutes under course record pace and 45 seconds in front of hawks. by this time, tollefson, running toward his childhood home in the foothills of the sierra nevada, had moved into third, just over 12 minutes back, looking very relaxed. thirty seconds later, hazen came through, unfortunately already looking decidedly rough. sometime before mile 38, walmsley had donned a bucket hat and continued to cruise at six minutes under record pace, slowly pulling away from the rest of the field. hawks held the gap to just six minutes while hazen and tollefson joined forces nearly 17 minutes back. the likes ofalex nichols(pre-race interview),drew holmen(post-race interview), andmax kingstayed close, just another seven minutes back. drew holmen working his way up at michigan bluff. by mile 50, walmsley had put eight minutes into the course record. maybe it was the bucket hat, but the only word to describe his appearance was relaxed. it was a full 26 minutes later before second place hawks rolled through, still seemingly running within himself. nichols led tollefson through, both looking strong. hazen continued to suffer, dropping back to fifth. by the time the leaders rolled through foresthill at mile 62, it was 93 fahrenheit in the shade, 97 in the sun, and time for the heat-management strategies to come into play. “it’s not the heat, it’s the hills,” said hawks. and after that, he’d lose 10 minutes to walmsley in the following five miles. he was now 48 minutes back and had nichols to contend with who was slowly closing the gap. that ever-infamous cal street, stretching between foresthill at mile 62 and the rucky chucky river crossing at mile 78, is where the day started to catch up to walmsley—but only a little bit. at the cal 2 aid station, he’d given back his advantage on the course record. from there on out, he moved faster than everyone else behind him, but slower than a 2019 walmsley. by green gate at mile 80, walmsley was now five minutes over course-record pace. but hawks came through a full 77 minutes back."
"a surging holmen was just 11 minutes behind and didn’t even stop. this was his first attempt at 100 miles, and he’d clearly done his homework on pacing and patience.tyler green(post-race interview) was also close behind. with a 14th-place finish at western states in 2019, green was on a mission to do better. tyler green cooling off in the american river (mile 78). by the time walmsley made it to robie point, just a mile to go, and with the course record now well off the table, he stopped for a coke and walked the climb. he would continue to cruise the final mile in his bucket hat to win his third western states in a row with a time of 14:46:01, still an incredible time for an excessively hot day. behind him, the race for the podium stayed intense. somewhere between green gate and pointed rocks at mile 94, hawks disappeared from the front of the race, leaving green in second place with holmen chasing just six minutes back.cody lindfollowed in fourth and just 17 minutes back. at the end, green would hold off holmen with a time of 16:11:00 to take second, a massive jump up from his 2019 finish. holmen completed the podium with a time of 16:23. both had started off conservatively and had it pay off in the end. lind would finish fourth in 16:49:40, an impressive run for his first 100 miler and first attempt at western states. he clearly had insider’s knowledge as the son of two-time western states finisherpaul lindand the grandson of the event’s original medical directordr. bob lind. (read more on the lind family legacy at the race.) cody lind finishing fourth in his debut at western states. tollefson rounded out the top-five men with a time of 16:55:49. he’d put off running western until he felt ready to do the race justice, and clearly, he was ready. the fact that he’d grown up in the area and run the last miles of the course hundreds of times certainly paid off in the race’s most difficult miles. in the back half of the men’s top 10, we had sixth-placekyle pietari, who executed yet another well-played top-10 performance,stephen kersh(post-race interview) who finished seventh for the second time in a row after curiously bouncing around most of the top-10 positions over the course of the day, and hawks who ultimately crossed the line in eighth place after experiencing physical struggles and a long stay at the mile 94 aid station to regroup. among the day’s breakout runs was ninth placekyle curtin, who moved up into the top 10 late. and nichols rounded out the top 10 in what looked like a difficult finish after an even more difficult day. to clear the air for those wondering, daniels dnfed at mile 55. hazen andjeff browningleft the race at mile 62. and hammond and king tapped out at mile 80. full results."

"congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2021hardrock hundred endurance run! this article breaks down the results of today’s lottery for the run’s 2021 edition. let’s start with some statistics and background information. after two straight cancelations, this year’s lottery was quite different as “nevers,” that is all runners who’ve never finished hardrock, were rolled over from the 2019 hardrock lottery, while “veterans,” runners who’ve finished hardrock five or more times, and “everyone else” (hereinafter “else”), runners who’ve finished between one and four times (and a couple grandfathered exceptions), were freshly drawn for hardrock 2021. with that in mind, there are 230 entrants in the lottery for next year’s hardrock. there are 186 else’s entered in the lottery (after accounting for the automatic entry of 2018 champsjeff browningandsabrina stanley) with a total of 900 tickets, with the number of tickets for each runner allocated as one ticket for each of a runner’s finishes, one ticket for each of a runner’s dnss since last starting, one ticket for applying, and tickets for various service criteria (full rules). else’s with one ticket had a 7.9% chance of getting in while the one runner with 11 tickets had a 59.6% chance of getting in. the 44 entrants in the veteran’s lottery had a total of 425 tickets with one ticket for each a runner’s finishes as well as for various service criteria. the eight veteran holders of the minimum of five tickets had a 44.5% chance of getting in, while the lone veteran with 27 tickets had a 95.6% chance of getting in. (odds and total ticket numbers cited were calculated prior to one runner moving from veteran to else and another having a service ticket added. those changes did not materially change the odds.) the 2021 event will start 145 runners. those 145 starters will come from an original pool of 155 runners made up of 28 veterans, 62 elses, and 65 nevers, a change from the previous mix of 33 veterans, 45 nevers, and 67 elses. the first 10 runners to withdraw from the race will not be replaced from their respective categories waitlists. replenishment of the field from the waitlists will being once the field is down to 145 runners. historically, up to five runners were chosen ahead of time by the run director,dale garland, and announced among the names chosen in the lottery. there are no new run director picks in the 2021 lottery. in addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into three separate division-specific waitlists. for perspective, in 2018, 3 people got off the veteran waitlist and into the race, 6 people from the never waitlist, and 24 people from the else waitlist. for the 2017 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrant spots 10 deep in the veteran division, 9 deep in the never division, and 6 deep in the else division."
"for the 2016 edition, the waitlist went to 4 deep for the veterans (which included all of the veterans on the waitlist that year), 4 deep for never, and 8 deep for else. even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is, in reality, competitive in nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which hardrock prides itself upon. below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2021 contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist with a reasonable chance to get in. the men’s race will feature 2018 championjeff browningreturning to defend his title with two hardrock debutants, 3-time utmb championfrançois d’haeneand 2-time ultra-trail mount fuji championdylan bowman, likely being his main challengers. the 2018 women’s championsabrina stanleyhas elected to use her auto-entry to return this year, and her closest competition with likely come from 2019 utmb champcourtney dauwalterwho excels in brutally difficult races, while three-time hardrock championdarcy piceuhas the best chance of joining them on the podium. there is only one way to gain an auto-entry into hardrock, and that is by winning the prior hardrock. jeff browning will be returning to defend his title in 2021. rollover men’s entrants from december 2018 lottery below are the notable men who gained entrance via the 2018 lottery for the 2019 race, but, as nevers or by winning the prior hardrock, retained entry into the 2021 race. men’s entrants from the december 2020 lottery full entrants list. there is only one way to gain an auto-entry into hardrock, and that is by winning the prior hardrock. sabrina stanley will be returning to defend her title in 2021. rollover women’s entrants from december 2018 lottery below are the notable women who gained entrance via the 2018 lottery for the 2019 race, but, as nevers or by winning the prior hardrock, retained entry into the 2021 race. unfortunately,andrea huser(2nd 2016 utmb; 1st 2016 & 2017 diagonale des fous; and so much more) would have rolled in as a never, but she recently passed away in a fall. women’s entrants from the december 2020 lottery full entrants list.

"the 2020transgrancanariacrowned a new champion in the women’s race with the usa’skaytlyn gerbin, who improved upon her second-place finish from last year. the women’s race for the podium was tighter than the men’s, with china’sfuzhao xiangarriving in a strong second and spain’sazara garcíain third, all three finishing within 17 minutes of each other. the men’s race saw a tie for the win between spaniardspau capellandpablo villa. for capell it was his fourth-straight win at transgrancanaria and for the pair it was a finish that mirrored a race they spent running together for the most part. the usa’sdylan bowmanworked his way up throughout the race, eventually onto the men’s podium in third. this year’s 128-kilometer route was quite different from years past due to a couple necessary course changes, including because of damage to the previous course by a 2019 wildfire. what was the same, however, was the 11 p.m. local time friday night start and the saturday afternoon finish for the leaders. the weather was also quite typical for spring on the canary islands, with cool temperatures at night (we saw temperatures as cold as 4 degrees celsius [39f] just before dawn) and, then, full sun and warm temperatures by day. and, you can’t forget that always-present island humidity. thanks tovert.runfor supporting our coverage of transgrancanaria. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. the start of transgrancanaria 2020. all photos: irunfar/bryon powell a tie for the win!pau capell(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was simply the favorite among the group of top runners, with his three previous victories here plus the last couple years he’s had in mountain ultramarathons in general. but what’s so great about ultrarunning is that… it’s ultrarunning. there are hours and mountains and the night and the sun and so many variables that come into play. oh, and there’spablo villa(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), too. the pair of spaniards went off the start line and stuck among the lead group right away, at times setting the group’s pace. also in that lead group was the usa’sjared hazen(pre-race interview) and china’speiquan you. this foursome remained together until somewhere after the race’s marathon point, while a long string of men trailed behind them. at the race’s halfway point distance-wise, 64 kilometers in, capell and villa arrived as a pair in the lead, but only by two minutes because hazen was still giving close chase. you was now out of the picture and he’d drop not long later. unfortunately, the next 10 kilometers would take their toll on hazen as he got off course and lost contact with the lead. from there, hazen only fell back further in the field before ultimately dropping not long after. from 64 kilometers until the 128-kilometer finish, it was capell and villa running basically with or near each other. here and there the pair separated by up to a few minutes, but they always seemed to come back together again. at the 110-kilometer aid station, when capell was ready to leave a bit sooner than villa, he waited."
"clearly, they were now traveling as a unit and that’s how it would go all the way to the finish. pablo villa (left) and pau capell after tying for the win at the 2020 transgrancanaria. dylan bowman(post-race interview) of the usa was the comeback kid of this race. after a rough year-plus health-wise with injury and physical issues, he’s back. he seemed to take things out a bit conservatively, but wanting to remain not too far off the leaders. it looked quite intentional, thus, that he hovered just outside the race’s top five for its first half. bowman has raced transgrancanaria before, and so he knows the difficult terrain that’s presented to runners about two thirds of the way through the race, the rough-and-tumble high volcanic section plus a long descent afterward. it was in this difficult stuff that bowman moved up into third place, a position he’d hold until the finish. dylan bowman and harry jones leaving artenara together at 64 kilometers into the race. like dylan bowman, the u.k.’sharry joneshovered in relative contact with the leaders for many of the race’s early kilometers. bowman and jones even looked to have teamed up for some time mid-race. on the long descent from the high country, though, the pair spread out and jones settled into fourth position. france’slambert santellialso had a strong race, like bowman and jones running a bit back from the lead but right around fifth position from very early on–and a position he’d be in at the finish. lambert santelli after finishing fifth. full results. gediminas grinius running trough the town of tejeda which is 74 kilometers into the race. last year, the usa’skaytlyn gerbin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took second at transgrancanaria. this year, she improved a spot to take the win and finished at the front of a relatively tight race for the podium and a fascinating race dynamic. let’s dig in. it was actually spain’sazara garcía(post-race interview) who led out the women’s race with what felt like a quiet confidence. she was calm and direct in her aid-station stops with her crew, which made it look like the race was coming easy to her. the same seemed almost certain to be true for gerbin, too, perhaps even more so. here we also add to the mix france’saudrey tanguy(pre-race interview), who was helping to pace set near the front of the women’s race early on. so, we had garcía off the front pretty much straightaway, with tanguy playing immediate chase through at least 27 kilometers into the race, where the pair passed through the aid station one-two and within one minute of each other. however, over the next 13 kilometers, garcía opened things up and no one was within 6.5 minutes of her at 40 kilometers in. as it turns out, this would be about her biggest lead because over the next 24 kilometers or so, gerbin reduced her 11.5-minute time gap to garcía to just 1.5 minutes. a chase was on. azara garcía leading the women’s race in teror (28 kilometers)."
"around this same time, the race’s halfway point, tanguy began to drop back from the very front of the race andfuzhao xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of china started to move up from her earlier position just outside the top five. however, there was a lot of racing to go as the women climbed up into, around, and down from gran canaria’s volcanic highlands, often where races are made or lost at transgrancanaria. when the women came off the highlands, the race had a new leader in gerbin, a position she’d hold through the finish line. and the podium race wasn’t yet decided either, as on the long descent to 110 kilometers, xiang and garcía switched spots, into second and third positions, which they’d keep until the finish. as much as gerbin, xiang, and garcía kept a relatively tight race between them, they also blew apart the rest of the women’s field. with 20 kilometers to go, the lead-three women had had already created an hour-plus gap on fourth place and the rest of the women’s field, and they’d widen it to 90 minutes by the finish. this trio was certainly in their own performance universe today. kaytlyn gerbin after winning transgrancanaria 2020. fuzhao xiang finishing in second. tanguy slowed significantly in the race’s second half, but clearly used her strength to stay in the top five, ultimately taking fourth. spain’sclàudia trempsfinished fifth while running evenly within the middle to the back half of the top 10 all race long. with this finish, tremps continues her ascendent efforts at mountain ultras over the last few years. clàudia tremps running in tejeda (74 kilometers). sweden’smimmi kotkafactored into the first half of the race when she was running just inside the top five. however, she would dnf following a painful fall. full results. audrey tanguy being interviewed by depa after finishing fifth. thank you so much to miguelito rodríguez, foncho clemente, texenery diaz, and inmaculada martel. we couldn’t have covered transgrancanaria without their canarian expertise! related articles:"

"the 2019the north face endurance challenge 50 mile championshipsis a day that will be remembered for its fast starts in both the men’s and women’s races, the fog that just kept clinging to the landscape and made for cool running conditions, and the to-the-wire shake-ups in both the women’s and men’s podium races. through it all, marin county localyiou wangand faraway frenchmansébastien spehlerheld steady for the win. and chasing them from the marin headlands to the finish line across the iconic golden gate bridge, it was canada’sanne-marie maddenand colorado’saddie bracywho rounded out the women’s podium with the newly-moved-to-californiadarren thomasand france’sthibaut garriviercompleting the men’s top three. a special thanks tothe north facefor making our coverage of this race possible! thanks, too, tobufffor supporting our coverage of the tnf 50. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. the start of the 2019 the north face endurance challenge 50 mile championships. photo: irunfar/bryon powell though localyiou wang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) has performed so well at other 50 milers, including a pair of wins at the not-far-to-the-northlake sonoma 50 mile, she’d not yet nailed the tnf 50… until now. let’s recap her dominant performance, which seemed to start with patience. in my mind, the early miles of the tnf 50 are tricky. it’s totally dark, the trails are super runnable in surface and yet windy and hilly and ever changing otherwise, and this year the fog was so thick that even headlamps were swallowed by the murk. despite that, yiou seemed to keep her calm in the fray of women, staying in contact with the lead but letting others set the pace. when the sun rose and the race strung out a little, this trend continued, with yiou running within spitting distance of the lead. things changed, however, as the race reached its halfway point miles-wise, at stinson beach and 27.4 miles into the race, where yiou basically shared the lead. and then things changed a second time, where yiou destrominated the rest of the field between there and our next vantage point, mile 33.5. there yiou cruised, putting more than five minutes on everyone else in six miles. this is the trend yiou held to the finish, where her 7:21 finishing time was 17 minutes better than everyone else. her win was greeted with much jubilation in the local trail running community awaiting her in the historic crissy field. yiou wang, 2019 tnf 50 mile champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell canada’sanne-marie madden(post-race interview) has come to be a familiar face on the tnf 50 over the years. she said after the race that she loves this event and let’s face it, this race seems to love her, too. anne-marie’s m.o. was to run her own race despite what the rest of the field was doing, and that meant staying out of early racing packs and moving up in the race’s second half. she also said after the race that she surprised herself to arrive to about mile 30 in third place, feeling as strong as one can feel with 30 miles already in the legs."
"anne-marie held this position until the final descent at around mile 47 when she came uponaddie bracy(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). after seeing in her in the distance for some miles before this, anne-marie decided to fight for second place, fueling up and hydrating before making a commanding pass. addie, too, is a fighter and she didn’t go quietly. anne-marie really had to work for the extra dollars awarded by finishing second, the pair crossing the line only 90 seconds apart from each other. anne-marie madden taking second at the 2019 tnf 50 mile. photo: irunfar/bryon powell if yiou and anne-marie were the podium finishers who hung back a bit in the first part of the race, then addie was one of the aggressors, pushing the pace and keeping the miles coming quickly. though this course has been run just once before, in 2017–the race was canceled last year due to wildfire smoke–we hadida nilsson’scourse-record-establishing splits from then to compare this year to. the women’s frontrunners were right around course-record pace through muir beach on the outbound, 17.8 miles into the race. by stinson beach at mile 27.4, the women arrived about five minutes behind ida’s 2017 run. addie certainly wasn’t alone in pushing the women along, as in the early milesclare gallagher(pre-race interview) andanna mae flynn(pre-race interview) were there, too. however, the leaders dropped clare first and anna mae later on, leaving addie as the remaining early leader still amongst the fray. after the race she said she paid the price for her fast start, and indeed, she ceded first and second place, but ever the competitor, she put nose to the grindstone to hold onto third, crossing the line looking like she’d used all she had. addie bracy in the early morning fog on her way to taking third. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks abby hall’sfourth-place run was a helluva’ performance, she at the finish looking so strong and only about four minutes out of podium position.abby levenerounded out the women’s top five, though she was a more distant 15 minutes behind fourth. just to see a few runners full circle, after her early push, clare slowed but managed to hang strong in the back of the top 10 to finish eighth while anna mae flynn was a dnf after midway. it also appears thattaylor nowlin, who we expected to feature in the race, dropped at some point, perhaps due to the flaring it band she mentioned to us mid-race. full results. keely henninger crossing the line in ninth place with the golden gate bridge in the background. photo: irunfar/bryon powell going into the tnf 50, you had to think france’ssébastien spehler(post-race interview) was coming in prepared to race for the win. i mean, he took second at the lake sonoma 50 mile in april and so he was coming to california for the second time in seven months. indeed, seb was all business in leading the race from early on, using an almost-polar-opposite strategy from the women’s race winner. at miles 13, 17, 27, 33, 39, 43, and 47, he led."
"from the start to stinson beach at mile 27.4, seb set roughly the same pace as 2017 champion tim freriks, but after that he slowed relative to tim. but despite him slowing relative to tim’s course-record-establishing run, seb still looked strong and gained significantly on the field. from miles 27.4 to 33.5, he put more than five minutes on everyone. and from miles 33.5 to 39.5, he increased his lead to 14 minutes. it seemed like the game was almost over. then it all changed, and fast. we waited for seb at mile 43.5 for quite a while, and we even thought we’d either somehow missed him among the runners from the event’s other simultaneous races or he’d somehow taken a wrong turn. finally, he arrived, heavily favoring his left leg and looking like he was having a hard time. he would say after the race that he had cramps and pain, but that they abated on the final downhill and allowed him to run well to the finish. that said, between miles 39.5 and 47, seb gave back eight minutes of his lead. though he looked well when we spotted him at mile 47, we still couldn’t help but wonder what would happen in the final miles. well, seb crossed the line as the 2019 champion with plenty of daylight between him and the rest of the field. funny thing was, because of simultaneous races and a man he could see in front of him from another race as well as a self-admitted language barrier, he didn’t know he’d won the race for a while afterward! sébastien spehler, 2019 tnf 50 mile champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks now, let’s talk aboutdarren thomas(post-race interview) and his second place. simply said, i think we should have seen this one coming a bit more clearly than we did. the dude’s been pumping out super-strong performances in the last couple of years, such that the pump seemed primed for a breakout race on a big stage. in the race’s first miles, darren featured in the lead group, shadowing other pace setters before settling in just 1.5 minutes off the lead at mile 16.8 and in sixth place. though his gap to the lead increased by several minutes between there and stinson beach at mile 27.4, he stayed in the same sixth place. then, on the long uphill after stinson beach, darren caught and passed three men, moving himself into podium position by mile 33.5. he said after the race that uphills are a strength and passing other runners gave him motivation for forging forward. suffice it to say that he wasn’t done moving forward and that he came upon france’sthibaut garrivier(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) around mile 43.5, where he passed him also and moved into second place, finishing like he still had gas in the tank. call it an incredibly impressive run and i certainly won’t be overlooking him in the future. darren thomas is so stoked with his second place."
"photo: irunfar/bryon powell thibaut said before the race that the rolling and runnable terrain of the marin headlands would be a challenge for him, but that he’d trained especially for it, thought he would do well until the 50-kilometer point, and then who knows what would happen after that. what happened was that thibaut also ran amongst the leaders and then in contact of the lead through mile 16.8, before lapsing back to the middle of the top 10 around the race’s halfway point. however, the steepest and most technical miles of the tnf 50 come in the middle of the race, and this terrain allowed thibaut to use his strengths to move up from seventh place at mile 27.4 to fourth place at mile 39.5. from there he managed to move from fourth to second, but then was soon passed by darren and bumped back to third, where he would stay to round out the men’s podium. thibaut garrivier makes his way in the mist on his way to third place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks i can’t help but think of several similarities between the women’s and men’s races, the super-strong finishes of second places anne-marie madden and darren thomas, the hang-on-and-hold-it third places of addie bracy and thibaut garrivier, and the wow runs of fourth places abby hall anddrew holmen. a lot like darren, drew also seemed primed for a breakout race, and indeed he earned himself one with his fourth place which was only a minute and change out of podium position. scotland’srobbie simpson(pre-race interview) crossed the line in fifth place, saying it was a difficult day in his debut ultramarathon but with a smile at the same time. to note, expected and early frontrunnermatt daniels(pre-race interview) was a late dnf. full results. anthony costales took seventh at the 2019 tnf 50 mile. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thank you so much to irunfar’s office team of ellie greenwood and casey szesze. thank you also to our field team which was composed of jonathan lantz, chris thoburn,david von stroh, olivia rissland, adam gerard, samitha reddy, melissa frayer, corrine malcolm, and stephen ettinger. we honestly cannot do what we do without the volunteer support of our community. thank you! related articles:"
"the usa’scourtney dauwalterand spain’spau capellwon the 2019utmb, in doing so making the 170-kilometer/105-mile loop around the european alps’s mont-blanc massif starting and finishing in chamonix, france. the 2019 edition fired off on friday, august 30 under stormy skies, as lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, and rain splattered up and down the chamonix valley. the race’s notoriously wet weather abated, though, and mother nature greeted most of the field–composed of 2,543 starters–with a warm evening, a comfortable first night, and a hot-and-humid saturday. saturday-afternoon thunderstorms returned around the course, bringing some runners a break from the heat. as far as we can tell, no modifications were made to the course due to weather for the front of the pack, as frequently happens at utmb. pau capell’s dominant performance in the men’s race was followed up by the defending champion, france’sxavier thévenard, taking second and new zealand’sscott hawkerbringing home bronze in what can only be described as a breakout performance. in the women’s race, courtney dauwalter was untouchable for the win, whilekristin berglundbroke out equally big with her second place and spain’s shorter-distance trail starmaite maioratook third, proving she can run as well at longer trail ultramarathons as she does at shorter events. in the balance of this article, we report in-depth on how the men’s and women’s races played out. don’t forget to have a look atour photo galleryfrom this year’s race. a special thanks tocamelbakfor making our coverage of utmb possible!thanks also toaltraandjaybirdfor their support of our utmb coverage. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. morning arrives in la fouly, switzerland on day two of the 2019 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the women’s race for the win was up in the air for some 90-plus kilometers. off the start line, china’smiao yao, who has enormous talent and a growing trail resume which included winning last year’s ccc but was racing 100 miles for the first time, went out like a bullet. if any of the women in the field had contact with her in the race’s first half, it had to have been in the first couple hundred meters because at seven kilometers in she was already more than 1.5 minutes off the front and then at 20km in she was up to 9.5 minutes ahead of the field. game on, yao. china’s miao yao running in the lead about 66 kilometers into the 2019 utmb. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks in the race’s early hours, a long train of talented women strung out behind yao, as we mentioned quite a distance from her but not so far apart from each other. that is, at 20km in, second and tenth places where just four minutes apart. then at 43km, the gap was just 20 minutes between #2 and #10. but the utmb’s marathon mark is one of several points in which this race gets interesting. that’s because runners are out in the deep night and the race’s most remote terrain, mostly off the grid in the mountains of italy. a lot can and does happen out there!"
"when we saw the women at about 66km, where they come out of that burly terrain and begin their approach to the relative mountain metropolis of courmayeur, italy, the women’s top 10 had strung out quite a lot and there had been some change-ups in who was in the frontrunner game. yao remained steadily out front, with a 15-minute lead.courtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had moved herself firmly into second position, and by firm i mean there was not only a gap between she and yao in first but also between she andmimmi kotkawho would run in third place for quite some time. a few other familiar faces were in place near the front, such as the u.k.’sbeth pascall(pre-race interview)who’d finished fourth last year and who wasn’t shy in saying during her pre-race interview with us that she wanted to improve upon that effort. courtney dauwalter cresting the grand col ferret during the 2019 utmb. photo: trail running argentina/irunfar/mauri pagliacci it is said that utmb ‘starts’ in courmayeur, italy, when the race reaches the 80km point. that is, to do well, you gotta’ turn up feeling strong at courmayeur. indeed, the race’s lead-three women all looked well there, with perhaps the smallest possible crack beginning in leader yao’s armor as the time gap between she and dauwalter had decreased by 2.5 minutes. everything can shift on a dime in ultrarunning, and that’s exactly what happened next. in the 12km between courmayeur and refuge bonatti, located high in on a ridgeline, dauwalter assumed the lead, coming into the refuge with a 10-minute gap to yao in second. yao’s day spiraled hard downhill from there, as she would be a dnf due to physical problems less than 20km later in la fouly. suddenly, it was a whole new women’s race and its dominant force was dauwalter. to be honest, the last quarter or so of this race looked hard for her. there was some real grin-and-bear-it action at times, she sending positivity out into the world but also no longer able to fully mask the effort’s difficulty. no matter what she looked like or said, however, the numbers never lied. aid station by aid station she increased her lead such that by 153km in vallorcine, after passing from switzerland back to france, she’d accumulated an hour’s lead. this was a gap she’d maintain on the women’s field all the way back to the finish in chamonix. even though she had a hip injury that required time off from running this summer, she was a cut above the rest of the women’s field. it was with great admiration from an international crowd lining the streets of chamonix that she was welcomed over the finish line as the 2019 utmb champion. courtney dauwalter, 2019 utmb champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again: i love these globally competitive races where runners who have been regionally or nationally successful in their home communities break out onto the international stage."
"almost every one of these races has at least one, and this year’s women’s breakout iskristin berglund(post-race interview) who took second place. nearly all race, the swede living in austria featured in the women’s top 10, for a long time in the back half of it before picking her way through the pack in the race’s second half. there were inklings of how good she might do here based on her previous performances, including in taking fifth at this year’s transvulcania ultramarathon. but utmb is 100 miles, and a tough 100 miles at that. berglund made her second-place effort look like clockwork, though. she was reliable, strong, and fluid all night, all day, and all the way around mont blanc. kristin berglund on her way to taking second at the 2019 utmb. photo: trail running argentina/irunfar/mauri pagliacci as the race’s kilometers waned, there was still plenty of racing to be done in the women’s field. one woman who had an incredible final-quarter surge was spain’smaite maiora(post-race interview). with plenty of success in shorter-distance trail running to lean on but nothing beyond about the 100km distance, maiora went out really easy, so easy she wasn’t even in the top 20 at 20km into the race. fast forward something like 20 hours, most of the way around mont blanc, and in vallorcine with less than 20km left to run, maiora had surged into podium position and looked amazing. though the women behind her weren’t too far off, maiora held tight to that third place until the finish. maite maiora running her way into third place at her first 100 miler, the 2019 utmb. photo: irunfar/marissa harris the remaining top-10 women fit into two clear categories: those who started very easy and moved up late, and those who put themselves into top-10 position right away and held it. in the former category, we have russia’sekaterina mityaeva. like several other top women’s finishers, mityaeva was venturing into the 100-mile distance for the first time and so she was clearly employing the conservative-early strategy. at several of the later aid stations, she looked pretty tired to our field team. but if she was feeling the effort, she was still moving well relative to her competitors. her relief was palpable at the finish line when she crossed in fourth place. pascall,katie schide(post-race interview) who is an american living in switzerland, andelise delannoyfrom france fit in the category of featuring up front all day and finishing in the top 10. pascall ultimately took fifth, a position lower than last year but what i’d call a definite performance improvement. her 2018 and 2019 times are nearly identical, though the 2019 course was longer and had more climbing. schide and delannoy respectively took sixth and seventh. now, let’s talk about the top-10 finishers who used the move-up-fast-and-hard-late strategy. americanrory bosio(pre-race interview), two-time utmb champion, didn’t feature in the women’s top 20 for at least 20km and the top 10 until the race’s final third."
"in addition to her all-day consistency, which led to an eighth-place finish, she provided entertainment out on the course for so many, hamming it up for her many fans, before sprinting to the finish to break 28 hours. hungary’sildikó wermescherfinished in ninth in what had to be the day’s best example of pacing. she was 651st overall at 8km into the race–well out of the women’s top 20–and 129th overall as well as ninth woman at the finish. tenth place was france’sdelphine avenierwho squeaked into the top 10 in the race’s final kilometers. after featuring in the women’s podium race early, kotka eventually finished in 20th. several favorites didn’t make it to the finish, including defending championfrancesca canepa(pre-race interview), last year’s second placeuxue fraile(pre-race interview) of spain, the usa’skaci lickteig, and the brazilian living in spainfernanda maciel. full results. courtney dauwalter running in switzerland during the 2019 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell alright, let’s dive deep into how the men’s race played out. the men’s race featured an outstanding line-to-line performance for the win, many blow-ups, and all the entertainment of running 100 miles around the mont blanc massif. as you may have read in our men’s preview, chamonix once again gathered some of the best male trail ultrarunners in the sport. on paper, as a three-time champ as well as the defending champ and the guy with the most victories at the utmb festival of races, france’sxavier thévenard(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was the clear man to beat. but the rest of the line-up made us look forward to a good spectacle, especially the quiet confidence we felt out of spain’spau capell(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) when we spoke with him pre-race. after the fanfare and freneticism of the utmb start, the countdown to the race finally ended and the men dashed off. in the lead off the line was capell and chinese starmin qi. pau capell already alone and way out front at st. gervais, 20 kilometers into the 2019 utmb. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks in a race filled with complex and intertwining variables, the men’s race for the win was perhaps as simple as it’s been at utmb in a half decade or more. capell immediately surged to the front and never looked back. we’ve seen this kind of running before, at this race and this early place in the event and, honestly, the odds are stacked heavily against the pace setter. what was funny–or at least coincidental–about all this is that capell even said in his pre-race interview with irunfar that he planned to take it slow while he thought others would go out too hard. at just 31km in, the catalan had a full eight minutes on thévenard in second, for example. but when we spoke with him post-race, he said that he ran according to the splits he’d made, and was surprised that his intentional pacing put him ahead of everyone. chasers at this point, 31km, included the likes ofzach miller(pre-race interview),tim tollefson(pre-race interview),erik sorenson,hayden hawks,jing liang, qi,guo-min deng, andcan-hua luo, what amounts to four americans and four chinese runners."
"at 31km, there were around 30 runners within 15 minutes of the lead. now that part is something we can always count on, the huge depth of the field. after the first big ascent on the col du bonhomme around the race’s marathon mark, things remained about the same, with capell pushing the pace and opening his gap even more. after a quick gear check, he took less than three minutes in the aid station at 50km, called les chapieux and way out in remote italy, before pushing on solo.robert hajnal(pre-race interview), the romanian underdog from last year who burst onto the world’s stage in taking second at this race, jumped into the top 10 together with americanalex nichols. onward around the mountain we go. robert hajnal at courmayeur, 80km into the race. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the italian side of utmb usually witnesses a lot of drops, and this year wasn’t an exception. one of the top runners to stop then was tollefson, who’d become physically ill. but the italian side of the mountain and it being the rough halfway point of the race, also sees runners emerging from the early fray as strong contenders for the full distance. among these potentials we had the united kingdom’sandy symondsandtom owens(post-race interview). so, too, we noticed new zealand’sscott hawker(post-race interview) was moving toward the top 10. and the usa’sandrew miller–remember him as the 2016 western states 100 champ?–jumped into the discussion, too. scott hawker cresting grand col ferret at sunrise. photo: trail running argentina/irunfar/mauri pagliacci fast forward a few more kilometers to the grand col ferret at 101km into the race and the border between italy and switzerland. it’s probably downplaying his performance to say that capell charged the big climb, and then he kept on charging to champex-lac at 126km. in both places we saw him panting with the effort and moving so fast, possessing not an inkling of hesitation. but so was thévenard, who has historically put moves on his competition in this section of the course. thévenard moved well, gaining plenty of time on the men behind him but still losing minutes to the lead. entering into the race’s final third, it was looking like capell was the better runner. up on the col we met a hajnal who wasn’t as fresh but was still moving in third. and in a move of complete badassery, hawker seemed to have left his earlier rough patch behind, and was now fourth and looking great. xavier thévenard pushing it at la fouly in switzerland. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at trient, 143km into utmb, thévenard had clearly pushed but couldn’t make headway on the big gap to the lead and was looking a bit worn. in fact, it seems like these efforts instead led to a rough patch he’d stay in until the race was almost over. hawker jumped on the podium spot, but he also had owens following close. new names in the top 10 in the race’s final third includedjoaquin lopezfrom ecuador and the basque battlerjavier dominguez."

"thepikes peak marathonis a one-of-kind race. runners begin on the streets of manitou springs, colorado, run a half marathon to the top of 14,115-foot pikes peak on the historic barr trail while climbing 7,770 feet, and descend all the way back to downtown manitou again. add in the factors of altitude, colorado’s hot summer temperatures, an at-times-sandy trail, now 64 years of history, as well as deep competition and this adds up to a race story as unique as the event itself. kilian jornetreturned to this race for the second time, his first time since 2012, and ran unchallenged at the race’s helm, finishing in the sixth-fastest time in the race’s now-64-year history.maude mathys, too, proved untouchable in the women’s race, setting a big new women’s course record. thanks tosalomonfor making our coverage of this year’s pikes peak marathon possible! to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. there was a lot of speculation prior to the 2019 pikes peak marathon, especially aroundmatt carpenter’srecord of 3:16:22 which he set in 1993 and whether the spaniard who lives in norwaykilian jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) could possibly break it. many people thought he could and many thought he wouldn’t–the latter group including jornet himself who said pre-race that carpenter’s record was something “really special.” by just a couple miles into the race, jornet had already broken free of the field and basically solo time trialled the rest of the event. he summited pikes peak in 2:09, some eight minutes off record pace but four minutes in front of anyone else, proving himself a level in front of the rest of the men’s field but not on the level of carpenter circa 1993. between the summit and the finish line, jornet put another 7.5 minutes on everyone else, crossing the line in 3:27:28. no doubt, this is a fast time, the sixth-fastest in the race’s long and competitive history. kilian jornet near the summit of pikes peak on his way to winning the 2019 pikes peak marathon. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks after a couple rough races, americansage canaday(post-race interview) has come on strong with his 11th place atsierre-zinaltwo weekends ago and now a great performance here. canaday ran among the men’s leaders until just after halfway up the half-marathon ascent. from there all the way up to the 14,000-plus-foot peak, he built a gap on the rest of the men’s field, arriving to the top in second place and 3.5 minutes in front of third. he said after the race that he knew he was a better ascender than descender, so he wanted to get a gap to the top that he could hold to the finish. this is exactly what he did, arriving to the finish line still solidly in second. his 3:39 finish improves upon his sixth-place debut here last year in 3:46. sage canaday running toward second place at the 2019 pikes peak marathon."

(in 2015, mathys received a warning without suspension from the disciplinary chamber for doping cases of swiss olympic for two positive tests for clomifene [previously clomiphene] after it was determined that she was mistakenly taking the drug without first obtaining a world anti-doping agency therapeutic use exemption.mathys’s quartz program profile shows regular health monitoring and a july 2019 anti-doping control.quartz program info.) maude mathys setting a new pikes peak marathon record at the race’s 2019 edition. photo: irunfar/bryon powell yngvild kaspersen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) had her own fantastic race. by the time she passed barr camp at mile 7.6, she was a minute in front of the rest of the field. this lead would basically grow by a few seconds to a minute each time we saw her. kaspersen, a norwegian who lives at sea level, said after the race that she was nervous about the extremely high altitude of pikes peak. it turns out she had not much to worry about, as she looked like she was jogging easily at the summit turnaround. she also said that her two-week vacation in colorado ahead of the race probably helped her to feel comfortable up there."

"in a rare turn of summer events, a weather system from near alaska bumped south into california, bringing with it unseasonably cool temperatures to the start of the 2019western states 100. as such, the thermometers never even hit the mid-80s fahrenheit at the race’s lowest altitudes, a good 15 to 20 degrees cooler than normal. with this, many runners were able to press the pace without the heat pressing back, leading to some fast times and, in some runners, aggressive running. in the women’s race,clare gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) emerged at the front of a fascinating and dynamic-to-the-wire women’s race to run the second-fastest time in women’s history, whilebrittany petersonandkaci lickteigrounded out the women’s podium. jim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won the men’s race handily, resetting his own 2018 course record by over 20 minutes.jared hazencrossed the finish in a solid second place–also under the previous course record–whiletom evansdebuted at the ws 100 in third. you can now watch thetop-three menandtop-three womenfinish and have their finish-line interviews. a special thanks todrymaxfor once again making our coverage of the western states 100 possible! thanks also tohoka one oneandbuff®for their support of our western states coverage. why is it that we run 100-mile races? they are long and they hurt–sometimes a lot. but there’s something about the mystique of the 100-mile distance that makes them so worthwhile. over the course of such a long journey, really, anything can happen and nothing is guaranteed.all of that said, i honestly thought this was going to becourtney dauwalter’s(pre-race interview)year, again. in fact, as the weather forecast leveled into something resembling cool for race day, i was almost certain she’d set a course record. in fact, i was so convinced i’d written down a lot of fact pieces aboutellie greenwood’sspectacular course-record run in 2012 to share as part of dauwalter’s day. for the race’s first 70 miles, the story played out very close to this. courtney started rather calmly before spending the race’s middle miles chewing into the course record. and the last time i saw her with my own eyes at mile 61, she looked just fine. courtney dauwalter leading at mile 55 of the 2019 western states 100… under record pace. all photos: irunfar/bryon powell so it was with as much surprise as i’m sure we all felt that i heard from members of our coverage team at peachstone, about mile 71 and along thehighly runnable california street, that she was limping noticeably. eight miles later at the rucky chucky river crossing, she was still leading, but it wasn’t looking good. she dropped at the green gate aid station two miles later with a hip injury. enterclare gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), now 2019 western states 100 champ. there’s something so full circle about this story, because the only previous time that gallagher was at the ws 100 was two years ago when she was running in podium position and had to drop at what i believe was after mile 90… with a leg injury. this year, it was she with the body that held itself together for the full distance."
"clare gallagher smiling in second place during the early miles. but we need to back up, all the way up to mile 15, because this was where we first saw gallagher running in second place. this would be the position she would hold all the way up until taking over the race lead after the rucky chucky river crossing at mile 78, some 63 miles later. what happened during all these miles? well, at the finish, gallagher said she thought she was racing for second place, that essentially there was a women’s race behind dauwalter’s race. during all that time, she said she was carefully racing the people behind her, meting out the energy she needed to stay ahead of them. but when it was her turn to lead, gallagher took over with ferocity. gallagher’s ferocity was only matched by the fierceness ofbrittany peterson(post-race interview) who, like gallagher, ran so steadily in third position for much of the race. peterson settled into third place before mile 15, and ran there until the climb from rucky chucky after mile 78 where she moved into second place ahead of an ailing dauwalter. brittany peterson took second at the 2019 western states 100. and then, really, the race was just beginning. at mile 85, peterson was in second and nine minutes behind leader gallagher. just nine miles later after mile 94, the two were neck and neck through the pointed rocks aid station. the race was on and it was clear that this was not going t0 be a hand-holding tie. according to peterson after the finish, gallagher surged incredibly after mile 94, and she was unable to respond. indeed, the numbers match. between miles 94.3 and 96.8–that’s 2.5 miles–gallagher gained one minute and 45 seconds. and the difference would grow from there. in the end, gallagher crossed the finish line in 17:23, what amounts to the second-fastest finish ever in race hisrory. peterson crossed the line in second place in 17:34, what should be the fourth-fastest time ever. somehow, it also seemed clear ahead of time thatkaci lickteig(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) should have a very good race. she’s the 2016 champ who’s suffered some ups and downs through the last few years of injury. but this year she’d been injury-free and so consistent in her training and racing that it seemed inevitable that she’d have quite a race. lickteig ran the first half of the race in the second half of the top 10 before moving up in the race’s second half into her ultimate finish position. when she crossed the line in third place, her 17:55 was a personal pr on the course in her six runnings of the race and faster than when she won in 2015. it’s good to have lickteig–happy and competitive–back at the ws 100. kaci lickteig after finishing in third. it’s always interesting to watch when a finish line, which is almost exclusively a shared finish line between two separate men’s and women’s races, becomes a women’s finish for a while."
"inevitably, men get their solo finish line for the time before women begin arriving, so it’s fun when just women roll over for a spell. and that’s what happened with fourth, fifth, and sixth-place finishersbeth pascall,camelia mayfield, andkaytlyn gerbin(pre-race interview). over the span of some 20 minutes, no man crossed the line–just women. and these three women put on quite a show. pascall practiced patience, moving up and seemingly looking stronger and more comfortable as the race went on. it was one of those circumstances that had me thinking she only needed more real estate and she could have found the podium. ultimately, she took fourth. beth pascall looking pleased with fourth place. mayfield and gerbin had an incredible race-closing sprint, with mayfield overtaking and outsprinting gerbin only on the placer high school track in the last meters of the race. they are registered on the results to have finished two seconds apart, but in person, it was a lot closer than that. after each of them running with strength all day, mayfield and gerbin respectively finished fifth and sixth. camelia mayfield outsprinting kaytlyn gerbin to the line. nicole bitter(post-race interview) took seventh, in doing so setting a huge new ws 100 pr of 18:55, which is more than 80 minutes faster than her previous time, which she set back in 2015 in taking sixth. kathryn drewwas eighth, and she executed what looked like from the outside as an almost-perfect race. she ran chill and yet focused early before putting the hammer down and holding stake in the women’s top 10 later. addie bracywas ninth in her first ws 100, and i can’t help but think it was a look of relief on her face when she finished.corrine malcolmfollowed up on her ninth place last year with a 10th place this time around, running outside the women’s top 10 until the race’s last 10 miles or less. lucy bartholomew, last year’s third-place finisher, crossed the line in 15th place. 2018 utmb championfrancesca canepawas 17th. notable dnfs in the women’s race includedcamille herronat mile 55,amanda bashamat mile 61, andyiou wangat mile 67. we haven’t heard details from all of them yet, but did hear basham hurt her leg in a fall. full results. jim walmsley’s course record two years, two course records.jim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) reset his own course record at the 2019 western states 100 through a combination of early race patience, middle-race pressing, and late-race raging. let’s dig in. in the first miles of this year’s race, walmsley didn’t lead, including when we saw him pass over over the race’s high point, at the iconic escarpment, at mile 3.5. and, by the race’s live tracker, even as late at mile 10 he was still well out of the lead. however, that changed some five miles later when we saw him at mile 15 and he was at the front of the race and about 1.5 minutes in front of everyone else. that said, he looked there like he wasn’t feeling the need to get anywhere too quickly just yet."
"he was clearly choosing patience in the race’s early miles, and, honestly, this was a kind of walmsley i’d only seen glimpses of before. it would go like this until approximately mile 30, at robinson flat, where is seemed he’d put his foot on the gas and went through a hair under his own record split for the first time. but easy does it, as from there he’d clip a few seconds or a minute at each aid station off his own record pace such that over 40 miles later at the peachstone aid station on the cal street section of the course, he was 16 minutes ahead of his own course record. these forty-six miles of running, he pressed some. jim walmsley on his way to resetting his own course record at the 2019 western states 100. but then, from miles 70 to mile 94, walmsley raged, gaining seven minutes on his course record–running a good bit per mile faster than he did last year when he set a then course record–and rolling through the pointed rocks aid station at mile 94 over 23 minutes ahead of his record. we all began to think,how low was he going to go?in his interview with us pre-race, he wondered the same. could he run 10 minutes faster than last year? twenty minutes? perhaps even sub-14 hours? the answer, at least this year, is 14:09:28, improving upon his 2018 finish time of 14:30:04 by over 20 minutes. walmsley is a pretty intense guy when he races, and he rarely shows much more than a little bit of emotion. it was a true pleasure to watch him cross the line fist pumping, hooting, and hollering. he was legitimately happy and letting it all out, a deserved celebration. the rest of the men’s race jared hazen’s(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) nickname amongst friends is the ‘tank,’ and he was a force rolling down the trail all day. he may be small in frame but his running style today was anything but. he was, for sure, a tank. like his friend, roommate, and training companion, jim walmsley, hazen was relaxed at the race opening–and even as far as 15 miles in he was in the back half of the men’s top 10. but when walmsley went to the front of the race, hazen went chasing, settling into second place, a position he’d hold all day and all race. between miles 10 and 40, the gap between walmsley and hazen slowly widened from a minute to about 10, and from there that was the approximate gap that would remain between the pair until mile 85. let me say that again, for 45 miles and with each of them running independently, they maintained just about the same pace, 10 minutes apart from each other. at the finish line post-race, hazen would say he paid a little bit late in the race for the pushing he did earlier on to try and stay in contact with walmsley."
"this pans out in the numbers, too, because hazen ultimately finished second and 17-plus minutes off the lead. all that said, his 14:26:46 finish was better than walmsley’s previous course record and is now the second-fastest men’s time stamp on this race. what a day. jared hazen was a tank at mile 78. how about those 100-mile debuters,tom evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andmatt daniels(pre-race interview)? the duo would go third-fourth on the day, each via their own racing style. while both of them said pre-race that they’d aim for a bit of patience early on in the race, on paper it looks as if daniels held his word a bit better. he was not even in the top 10 at 10 miles into the race! however, by about one third of the way into the race he’d wriggled his way up into third position, which he’d hold through the race’s second third. then, there was the journey of evans, which began a bit more aggressively with him in third just 10 miles into the race, a mid-race lull which would see him lapse back to fifth place in the heart of the canyons part of the course, before he and daniels flip-flopped positions on cal street.at the end, it wasn’t close, with evans crossing the line as the third and final sub-15-hour finisher of the night and joining the ranks of a select few who’ve finished under that barrier. daniels arrived 22 minutes later, both showing a special kind of 100-mile racing ability–and future potential. i know it’s still the 2019 race day, but the idea of these top-four men on the starting line next year, all with this year’s accumulated experience, is a grand one. tom evans would take third. mark hammond(pre-race interview) said in his pre-race interview that he planned to go out a little more aggressively this year, and that he’d been doing interval training to hopefully develop more leg speed. though he finished fifth after two years finishing in third place, his 15:36 this year is more than a half hour faster than he’d yet run here. his new approach appeared to pay out dividends. this year, mark hammond took fifth, and set a ws 100 pr. back in 2015,gediminas griniusfinished fourth in 15:40. this year, he crossed the line in sixth and 15:43. how about that for consistency? this finish is his first in the u.s.’s grand slam of ultraunning. next up, thevermont 100 milein three weeks. not bad for the first of four grand slam of ultrarunning races for gediminas grinius. what an impressive run we all witnessed out ofstephen kersh! he took seventh and ran 15:54 in not only his first western states, but also his first 100 miler. and that’s on the shoulders of him running his first 50 miler just a couple months ago at thelake sonoma 50 mile. we should all expect to see more good things come out of him here in trail ultrarunning. patrick reaganhad a helluva’ race!"

"he was put to a big test with 2k to go, though, as italy’sfrancesco puppi(pre-race interview) passed him and took over third place for a short stretch. mathys explained after the race that he caught up with and re-passed puppi with just 800 meters left, finishing in third by just 10 seconds. what a race for the final podium position! italy’s puppi began the race a bit further back, but made up positions as the race went on. after finishing fourth in his trail world championships debut, puppi said he gave it everything he had on the day. christan mathys of switzeland upon finishing third. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks france’snicolas martinraged across the finish line to take fifth, clearly making every single second of his race count. only a minute later, martin’s teammateemmanuel meyssatcrossed the line, sealing the deal on a team france gold medal with their second, fourth, and fifth-place individual finishes. france’sludovic pommeret(pre-race interview) was seventh, spain’santonio martinezeighth, spain’sandreu simonninth, and portugal’shélio fumotenth. if it sounds like spain was on its way to a team second place, hold up just a moment. the united kingdom’scarl bellandandrew daviescrossed the line in 13th and 16th respectively, securing a team silver. then, it was spain who took a team third. the men’s team podium at the 2019 trail world championships. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks three-time defending championluis alberto hernando(pre-race interview) of spain finished in 11th place, saying after the race that he suffered in the race’s second half after running the first half quite hard. full results. as with every edition of the trail world championships, the women’s field is one of the most competitive in our sport. especially in a shorter distance like it was today, where runners from both trail running and shorter-distance mountain running gathered together to meet on this event’s middle ground. nevertheless, this looks like it didn’t make a huge difference onblandine l’hirondel’s(post-race interview) race strategy. the frenchwoman went out hard, opened a gap, kept on running hard, and won straight out. at the finish, she was eight minutes ahead of any other runner, which might as well be a lifetime in a 44k race. wherever we saw her, she was solid. she probably had a small low patch about three quarters of the way through the race, but the rolling downhill finish helped her stay strong and take the win completely unchallenged. to be honest, she looked shocked to arrive at the finish as the women’s winner. if anyone’s race should be called a breakout, it’s l’hirondel’s. blandine l’hirondel of france after winning the 2019 trail world championships. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks the rest of the podium spots were tough to grab. several women said after the race that l’hirondel took the race out really fast, and they felt compelled to play chase in an effort to not let her get too far away. a group of women started fast as they chased, including names likeadeline rocheof france,denisa dragomir(pre-race interview) of romania, as well assheila avilés(post-race interview) andazara garcíaof spain."

"amongst a challenging course and competitive fields,ragna debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), of the netherlands but living in spain, and france’sthibaut garrivier(post-race interview) won the 2019transvulcania ultramarathon. before dawn on saturday morning, may 11, from el faro de fuencaliente, the south tip of la palma island, transvulcania fired off and runners raced for the sky. by the time the 74.3-kilometer (46 miles) course concluded in the city of los llanos on the island’s west side, participants racked up some 4,350 meters (14,280 feet) of climbing. during that distance, they ran through volcanic cinder, over lava rocks, among the island’s famous banana plantations, over the island’s approximately 2,420-meter (7,940 feet) high point, and on the race course’s infamous descent from that high point to sea level. both the men’s and women’s races were dynamic courtesy of deep fields, with the men’s race staying volatile until the bottom of that 2,400-meter descent when there was less than 10k left to race. it was there that thibaut garrivier finished the downhill faster than the rest of the field and created the few-minute gap which secured him the win. the women’s race stayed similarly tight up and over the race’s high point, though women’s champion ragna debats used the long downhill to create a major gap of 15 minutes by 5k to go. irunfar is an independent entity covering the sports of trail running and ultrarunning around the world. if you like what we’re doing, considerbecoming a monthly patron on patreonormaking a one-time donationto support our work. thank you! to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. let’s jump right into it. sweden’spetter engdahl(post-race interview), a nordic ski racer turned mountain runner, took the race out hot. at 7k into the day, he’d already created a little space between he and the rest of the field, though many men played close chase. this time gap increased to about six minutes around the 40k point. about then, though, two men behind engdahl began working together to reel him back in. petter engdahl leading the race at 22k before continuing on to take third. all photos: irunfar/meghan hicks enter france’sthibaut garrivier(post-race interview) and russia’sdmitry mityaev(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). though earlier in the race, the pair ran among some pace pushers who would eventually drop back and out–such as italy’smarco de gasperiand france’ssylvain court–by the halfway point they’d moved into second and third positions. roughly there, they started working together to reconnect with engdahl over the race’s highest terrain. as such, the trio arrived to the roque de los muchachos aid station at 51k on the island’s high point within a few seconds of the other, engdahl and garrivier actually together and mityaev a few seconds back. thibaut garrivier on his way to winning the 2019 transvulcania ultramarathon. but as is usually the case with this race’s unique 2,400-meter continuous descent, the race really shook out there. engdahl dropped off the lead group, later saying he experienced some problems on the downhill. he fell hard at one point and it shook his confidence enough that he rolled a bit more conservatively after that."
"then, it was a two-man race between garrivier and mityaev. both reported after the race taking hard falls on the descent, too, though mityaev’s fall caused enough pain that he had to pause for some 40 seconds and he lost contact with garrivier. garrivier, on the other hand, continued his strong descent, finishing it with a 3.5-minute lead. the race doesn’t end when that descent does, though! it’s still about 5k to the finish line, which includes 400 meters of climbing. however, garrivier held that 3.5-minute gap all the way to the finish line. after taking third last year, garrivier movef up the the premier position to become the 2019 transvulcania ultramarathon champion. while garrivier has had increasingly strong results in the last few years, this win marks a definitive breakout. mityaev crossed the line a few minutes later to take second for the second year in a row. though engdahl couldn’t compete for the win, it was no contest between he and the rest of the men’s field for his third-place position, with the next man not rolling over the line for some 15 minutes. dmitry mityaev after finishing second for the second year in a row. jonathan albon(pre-race interview), who lives in norway and is from the u.k., said after the finish that he suffered the heat but otherwise felt okay in taking fourth. switzerland’sdiego pazosfinished fifth, completing his double of taking second at the madeira island ultra-trail just two weekends ago. peru’sremigio huamanhung in the men’s top 10 all day to ultimately finish sixth. in seventh was the usa’smax king, who said ahead of the race that he was battling plantar fasciitis. he looked strong and moved well in the race’s uphill and flatter terrain, but ultimately wasn’t able to run the huge, late-race downhill properly due to his foot. spain’smanuel anguitafinished eighth, following up on his sixth place here last year. the ninth and 10th positions were filled by germans via the efforts offlorian reichertandhannes namberger. japan’sruy ueda(pre-race interview) was another dnf. he unfortunately got sick a couple days before the race and said by 22k that he was already feeling like he had no energy. full results. the top-10 men of the 2019 transvulcania ultramarathon. france’sanne-lise rousset séguret(pre-race interview) set the pace off the starting line. in our pre-race interview, rousset séguret said she was confident in her training and preparation, and it showed. there may also have been something to the fact that she had two previous second-place transvulcania finishes going into this year’s edition. just like petter engdahl in the men’s race, rousset séguret had a gap at 7k into the race. but unlike the men’s race, a couple women would not let rousset séguret get away from the field on her own. anne-lise rousset séguret leading the women at 22k. she eventually finished second for the third time at transvulcania. so here we addragna debats(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andmegan kimmel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) to this story."
"as the massive, initial climb continued toward the 16k mountain top that’s a focal point of the race’s first half, this trio of ladies were grouped within about a minute of each other. and as a group they were breaking away from the rest of the women’s field. by 16k, third place was more than 10 minutes ahead of fourth and this lead grew to about 18 minutes by 42k. theirs was such a strong break that, barring anything crazy happening, these women would become the podium. however this is ultrarunning and crazy things happen all the time, which is half of the fun of it. eventually, on the gradual uphill terrain between 31k and 42k, debats made her way into the leadership position. she would say after the race that she felt okay at the start but suffered a physical low around 20k where she tempered her effort. then, she said she felt better again. by 51k in and over the race’s high point at roque de los muchachos, debats had a five-minute lead. kimmel rolled over the high point in second, and rousset séguret had fallen back to third, another four minutes back of kimmel. though she no longer led, rousset séguret’s position still seemed safe, as it was more than 20 minutes until the next woman hit the high point after her. debats exhibited incredible strength on the 18k-long downhill between 51k and 69k, and tripled the length of her lead in that time. then, in the tough 5k finish, which involves running up a dry riverbed, making a steep 400-meter climb, and finishing with a couple flat kilometers in los llanos, she picked up a few more minutes on all the other women, crossing the line as the 2019 transvulcania ultramarathon champion. ragna debats on her way to winning the 2019 transvulcania ultramarathon. kimmel held onto second place for over half of the descent, but was overtaken by a surging rousset séguret in the bottom half. rousset séguret arrived to the finish line in second place–for the third time at this race. and kimmel crossed in third, rounding out the women’s podium. ultimately, the three-woman early race break stuck. megan kimmel finishing third. until 51k, russia’sekaterina mityaevaran in the back half of the women’s top 10, in eighth place for much of the morning. but mityaeva runs downhills well and she moved up from eighth to fourth on the 2,400-meter, 18k descent, a position she then maintained to the finish. austria’skristin berglundhad a steady day, finishing fifth after running most of the race in the middle positions of the women’s top 10. italy’selisa descotook sixth place. from 2010 to 2012, desco served a two-year ban from the iaaf after she tested positive for epo at the 2009 world mountain running championships. zimbabwe’semily hawgoodtook seventh;camille bruyas, a french citizen from la réunion, was eighth; germany’seva spergerwas ninth; and spain’smaria zorrozatook 10th. full results. the top-10 women (minus one) of the 2019 transvulcania ultramarathon. thank you to marissa harris and miguelito rodriguez for their help in covering the transvulcania ultramarathon!"

"the 2019madeira island ultra-trail(miut) began in the coastal village of porto moniz, on the island’s northwest coast, traced through the island’s interior mountain ranges, traversed deep and dissected valleys, and finished in the port city of machico, on the island’s southeast coast. the route added up to 115 kilometers (71.5 miles) and 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of climbing. the course itself is diverse, with a mix of steep and technical terrain as well as flat and fast roads and the island’s famous levada trails, or the pathways next to irrigation ditches. this year’s edition, the 11th, saw relatively fair weather. with a midnight start and seven hours of night running to begin, runners experienced cool temperatures through the night with wind in some locations and fog in others. after sunrise as the leaders headed toward the island’s highest and most exposed terrain, a strong wind but totally clear skies greeted them there. in the later morning and early afternoon, as the leaders traveled the race’s final 20 kilometers at low altitude, temperatures remained mild thanks to decent cloud cover, though the relative humidity was quite high. their races played out quite differently, but both the usa’scourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and france’sfrançois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ran away from their respective fields to take home dominant victories. for courtney, she took the lead on the race’s first major climb after 5k, setting the women’s race tone and pace, and never looked back. françois shared the race with other runners until just before 80k before closing the race’s final 35k at a pace no one else could match. this was the seventh race, a series race, in the 2019 ultra-trail world tour. irunfar is an independent entity covering the sports of trail running and ultrarunning around the world. if you like what we’re doing, considerbecoming a monthly patron on patreonormaking a one-time donationto support our work. thank you! the high country of madeira island over which the madeira island ultra-trail travels. all photos: irunfar/meghan hicks ahead of the race, many wondered how exactly the usa’scourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) might fare on the stairs and gnarly descents of madeira island. i think we all have our answer now: dauwalter is a master of all terrain. but let’s back up to the beginning. after chasing defending championmimmi kotka(pre-race interview) through the first couple kilometers, dauwalter settled into the lead on the race’s first big ascent to fanal, the first checkpoint at 14k. there, she posted a gap of just under two minutes to the rest of the women. while behind her there were several early shake-ups on who was in the immediate chasing position and while some women posted faster times than her on the earlier, big descents, no woman could match her overall pace. that is, on every climbing or flatter section, dauwalter’s gap on the women’s field grew. and after the first couple large descents, she was making time on almost all of the rest of the field on the really technical sections and downhills, too."
"courtney dauwalter about to summit pico do areeiro at 76k into the 2019 madeira island-ultra trail. there was one woman who exceeded dauwalter’s pace through the race’s most technical 5.5k after the island’s high point at pico ruivo and on some of the descents later in the race, and that’s dauwalter’s country matekatie schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). from 61k through 99k, schide was overall gaining on dauwalter, picking up a couple minutes on her at the majority of checkpoints. at 99k, schide’s deficit to dauwalter had decreased to about 14 minutes, and with 16k yet to race, we all wondered if a race was about to, indeed, happen. but there was so much runnable terrain after 99k, and let’s just say that dauwalter can really run. her pace on the flattest, last kilometers was so strong that she was, in fact, faster than the men’s champion there. in the 11.8k between the final aid station of larano and the finish, dauwalter ran a 1:05:14 split. men’s champion françois d’haene ran 1:05:39. on a quick check of the men’s top 10, only one man posted a faster split in that section than she. dauwalter crossed the miut finish line in machico looking relieved, happy, and somehow still fresh as the women’s champion. not only was schide super strong all race, especially in the mountainous and technical sections, but she also had a super-positive demeanor out there, too. schide seemed to move with a kind of levity that made moving fast look easy. she took second place, doing so with a large gap over the rest of the women’s field. katie schide taking the big mountains in stride on her way to second place. third place audrey tanguy is in the background. schide and france’saudrey tanguy(post-race interview) are friends, the pair going one-two at the 85k race of miut last year and racing as a team in a recent partner race in europe. schide and tanguy fell into step with each other before the chão da ribeira aid station at 22k, and though they continued to leapfrog a bit, they were clearly working together for a lot of the middle of the race. this pair-up lasted basically through chão da lagoa at 81k, after which schide surged. though tanguy lost contact with schide, her late-race effort remained strong–and stronger than anyone else behind her. by the time she crossed the finish in third place, there was no other woman in sight for a half hour. audrey tanguy after taking third at the 2019 madeira island ultra-trail. i’m not going to lie, spain’smaite maioralooked a little rough at the finish, with giant bruises and some trail rash on her left leg and her arms and legs coated in dirt–she must have gone full body to the ground at some point–but her condition there was just temporary and doesn’t match the strength she showed on course."
"a lot like men’s fifth-place finisher lambert santelli, who’s race is described below, maiora raced with incredible consistency all day in fourth and fifth positions, before eventually moving for good into fourth where she would finish. like schide, she, too, was super positive on course. in fact, when we saw her approaching 1,800-meter pico areeiro, high wind was pushing her sideways on the exposed trail and it whipped her visor off her head and off the cliff. no matter, maiora was still content. france’sjocelyne paulysaid after the race that it was a struggle for her. early race, she took a hard fall onto some rocks, one of which went right into her rib cage and caused pain and difficulty breathing for the rest of the race. as such, she looked really relieved to cross the finish in fifth place. defending champion kotka looks to have had a pretty tough day. early in the race, she was strong on the downhills, but would lose time to the top women on the uphills. later in the race she slowed and finished in 13th place. full results. the 2019 madeira island ultra-trail women’s podium (l-to-r): 2. katie schide, 1. courtney dauwalter, and 3. audrey tanguy. the way i see it, the race for the men’s podium can be divided into three parts: 1. the early race where many men ran close to the lead; 2. the breakaway of the trio composed of france’sfrançois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),tim tollefson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of the usa, and france’sgermain grangierfrom the rest of the field; and 3. françois’s solo, late-race dominance. we begin with part one, or the first 30k, where a long string of men ran within a couple minutes of the lead.at the first checkpoint of fanal, 14k into the race, it was essentially a 20-man group within about two minutes of the lead. and by 22k at chão da ribeira, 15 men were still right there. the pacesetters of this group varied from moment to moment, but included defending championandris ronimoiss(pre-race interview) of latvia, sweden’s petter restorp, and france’s thomas angeli. of course, the eventual podium finishers were there too, lingering. somewhere before estanquinhos at 32.5k, d’haene, tollefson, and grangier started running together and breaking free of the rest of the men’s field, which leads us to part two of the men’s race. at 32.5k, they were 2.5 minutes ahead of everyone else, at 41k it was five minutes, and by 61k at curral das freiras, the trio was a full eight minutes off the front. but almost all good bands eventually break up, and this group met that same fate at 61k. part three of the men’s front race began when tollefson took several extra minutes at the 61k aid station, and left about three minutes behind d’haene and grangier. and on the massive climb to madeira island’s high point of pico ruivo between 61k and 71.5k, tollefson lost more time, arriving to the summit 14 minutes behind the lead and in fourth place."
"d’haene and grangier stayed together through 81k at chão da lagoa, after which d’haene took over solo leadership duties. from there to the finish, d’haene’s lead on the field grew, such that he crossed the finish with no one in sight for almost 25 minutes. his victory makes it his second miut win, and shows he’s beginning his 2019 season in fine form. françois d’haene, 2019 madeira island ultra-trail champion. switzerland’sdiego pazos(post-race interview) is a great example of how you can run your own race and podium in a long ultramarathon. after running the first 15k close to the lead, pazos spent the next marathon distance chilling, running around seven to eight minutes off the lead. then, on the big climb out of curral das freiras to the island high point between 61k and 71.5k, his strong ascending moved him into podium position. for the next 15-plus-k and through the race’s most difficult terrain, pazos recorded almost the same splits as eventual winner d’haene, which allowed him to move up into second place after the 80k point, a position he held to the finish. diego pazos celebrating second place. when we saw tollefson at about 76k and in fourth, he said that his climbing legs were cooked but that he could still run the downhills and flats alright. it was clear that he was planning to keep his foot on the gas as best as he could. relentless forward progress, as they say, and he moved up into third position before portela at 99k and held it until the finish. tim tollefson taking in the night running which opened the race. ahead of the race, romania’srobert hajnalspent about 1.5 months living and running on madeira island to specifically prepare for miut. his preparations certainly paid off. after chilling outside of the men’s top 10 for the first half of the race, he stayed strong in the race’s second half, consistently moving up positions from checkpoint to checkpoint, and generally looking like he was having a good time doing so. finally, at portela at 99k, hajnal arrived in fourth position, which he would hold until the finish. france’slambert santellihad an incredibly consistent race. for pretty much all 115k, he ran in fifth or sixth position. each time we saw him, he seemed in total control. he ultimately found his final fifth-place position at 99k, and maintained it to the finish. defending champion and early race pacesetter ronimoiss dropped at 32.5k. and grangier, who ran at the lead of the race, ran into problems starting around the poiso checkpoint at 90.5k. around then he fell and became injured, and after that traveled slowly to portela at 99k where he dropped out. full results. the 2019 madeira island ultra-trail men’s podium (l-to-r): 2. diego pazos, 1. françois d’haene, and 3. tim tollefson. thank you to mauri pagliacci for his office assistance. thank you to joão guerreiro, dani zigerlig, and nathalie maurhofer for their field assistance. our live coverage couldn’t have happened without this team!"

"the story of the 2019vibram hong kong 100klooks to be that of another set of breakout international performances for mainland chinese ultrarunners. while past years have showcased the likes oflong-fei yan,dong li,yiao mao, andmin qi, this year’s race could be the rest of the world’s first notice that race winnersyangchun luandjiasheng shenare forces to be reckoned with. while not a scorcher weather wise, it was warm and humid and a bit toasty when the sun cracked through the cloud layer for an hour or two midday. that combination was enough to challenge many runners, especially those coming from cooler climes. still, the highly varied, yet unrelenting course was the true test. both during and after the race, some runners would highlight the difficulty of the highly runnable sections early in the race, while others would wince at the challenging cement stairs that dominated the climbs and descents. read on below to find out how the race played out up front. thanks tokailasfor sponsoring our coverage of the vibram hong kong 100k. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. what a fun race to watch! i watch many races every year and this was one of the most exciting i’ve seen in a while. through the first third of the race, 2015 championlong-fei yanand first to cross the line in 2018 (but later dqed)jing liang(post-race interview) led the race withtom evanschasing not far behind.zhenlong zhangandjiasheng shen(post-race interview) ran two and two-and-a-half minutes back at 34 kilometers, as the only other runners within five minutes of the lead with only two more within 10 minutes of the front. honestly, it looked like a three-man game between yan, liang, and owens. at 57km, liang and yan were racing at breakneck speed in the front, both pushing hard. and evans… he was out, withdrawn for a yet-unknown-to-me reason. so, seemingly one of two men, racing hard at the front, would be the day’s victor. but, that shen guy was flying, too, and only two minutes back. the next four runners were all chinese, but none was within nine minutes of the front. jing liang leads at 57km with long-fei yan in tow. photo: irunfar/bryon powell not much later we get a note and confirm via gps tracking… yan is walking with an injury. he pulls out at the next checkpoint. it’s now one man at the front. at 70km, liang holds the lead. could redemption be his after last year’s finish-line disqualification? ah, but shen runs by just 30 seconds later. at 82km, liang’s doubled that lead to a full minute, but shen looks the fresher of the two. what’s this? gps shows liang’s off course? yes, and shen’s in the lead for several hundred meters? oh, what heartbreak liang must feel, but he quickly turns around and closes in. ah, but it’s not to be. jiashen shen builds his lead to four minutes over liang at the final checkpoint with 10km to go and, then, extends that lead to nearly 14 minutes by the finish."

"the lottery for the 2019western states 100took place yesterday, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. however, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. this year’s lottery saw a 19% increase in applicants over last year. the starters list in june 2019 will ultimately contain 369 runners, a number decided by the race’s permit through the granite chief wilderness area. among this there will be 102automatic entrants(some decided and some yet to be decided, see below for details), three that were drawn from those who were in the live audience for the lottery itself, and 262 runners who were chosen in yesterday’s lottery. a change was announced to the ws 100 entrance process in 2016, and will be implemented for the third time in the 2019 event, a 50-person general waitlist. if a registered entrant decides not to race, members of the waitlist will move onto the entrants list. yesterday, that waitlist was also filled from among the lottery entrants as well. for perspective, in last year’s use of the waitlist, it went 36 deep in offering waitlist members spots in the race. the ws 100 website has anup-to-date list of the 2019 western states 100 entrantsand will have a separate list for waitlisted runners. let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into ws 100 so far. the women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2019 as automatic entries, and all 10 women have chosen to do so: the men’s top 10 from 2018are also invitedto return with auto-entries, and all but one intend to do so: according to ultrasignup, 81 of the 102 auto-entry slots were filled ahead of the race, with 19 of those being top-10 returnees from last year. below are some speedy women and men who have already achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methodsso far: women men a total of 262 names were drawn during yesterday’s lottery, and among them were a small number of speedy and notable athletes. men women top runners still have two routes by which they can gain automatic entry into the 2019 ws 100. the five-race 2019altra golden ticket raceswill offer up to 20 ws 100 entries to be given to top finishers of these races. the top-two men and top-two women finishers of each race gain entry, and if they already have an entry or if they decline it, the entry can roll down as far as fifth place. here’s the race-series schedule for 2019: related articles:"
"congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2019hardrock hundred endurance run! this article breaks down the results of yesterday’s lottery for the run’s 2019 edition. let’s start with some statistics and background information. this year’s lottery entrants list was up to 2,488 applicants. for perspective, the 2018 lottery had 2,236 entrants, the 2017 lottery 1,966 entrants, and the 2016 lottery 1,549 applicants. these 2,488 entrants were represented by 18,071 total tickets, which went into today’s lottery buckets. for perspective, last year’s total ticket pool was 12,357 tickets. prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants into one of three divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. the divisions are veterans, runners who’ve finished hardrock five or more times; nevers, who are runners who’ve never finished hardrock; and everyone else (or, more simply, “else” below), runners who’ve started the event and finished between one and four times. for the 2019 lottery, there were 37 veteran applicants who had 362 tickets, 2,222 never applicants with 16,818 tickets, and 229 else applicants with 891 tickets. looking back at last year’s lottery, there were 43 veteran applicants who had 422 tickets, 1,975 never applicants with 11,127 tickets, and 218 else applicants with 808 tickets. (note that a runner’s ticket in the never pool are subject exponential increase, not the simple increase by addition as in the other two pools.) the 2019 event will start 145 runners. today, the event organization selected 33 veterans, 45 nevers, and 67 elses. of the 145 entrants chosen, up to five were chosen ahead of time by the race by run directordale garland, which were announced among the names chosen in the lottery. in addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into three separate division-specific waitlists. for perspective, in 2018, 3 people got off the veteran waitlist and into the race, 6 people from the never waitlist, and 24 people from the else waitlist. for the 2017 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrant spots 10 deep in the veteran division, 9 deep in the never division, and 6 deep in the else division. for the 2016 edition, the waitlist went to 4 deep for the veterans (which included all of the veterans on the waitlist that year), 4 deep for never, and 8 deep for else. even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end is, in reality, competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which hardrock prides itself upon. below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2019 contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in."
"let’s start with the men’s race, which is by far the most competitively loaded field in hardrock history.xavier thévenardwas pulled in the lottery again this year after a dramatic lead and equally dramatic disqualification at mile 90 during last year’s hardrock for taking aid outside of the station. he’ll be challenged by four-time winner and the holder of both course recordskilian jornet,2016’s co-championjason schlarb,and 2018’s championjeff browning. throw in 3-time utmb championfrançois d’haeneand 2-time ultra-trail mount fuji championdylan bowman, both of whom will be making their hardrock debut. should the race-day conditions be even remotely favorable, it would seem like counterclockwise course record of 23:28:10 set by kilian in 2015 will be in play. the 2018 women’s championsabrina stanleyhas elected to use her auto-entry to return this year, and her competition with likely come from from swiss runnerandrea huserwho seems to either win or podium at every highly competitive european race she starts, as well as 2018 western states championcourtney dauwalterwho excels in brutally difficult races. throw in three-time hardrock championdarcy piceu, who is on a roll with 100 mile victories and has, by far, the most experience at this race with seven finishes no worse than runner-up. there is only one way to gain an auto-entry into hardrock, and that is by winning last year’s addition. jeff browning will be returning to defend his title in 2019. below are the notable men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. original full entrants list. here are the notable women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. original full entrants list.

"around the 60km mark is where the race really started to change and the big group that had been running together started to string out. one of the men’s race favorites, south africa’sbongmusa mthembu(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took the lead and left the main group along with bothtakehiko gyoba(post-race interview) andhideaki yamauchi(post-race interview), both of japan. behind them, it was japan’snao kazami(pre-race interview) holding in fourth place withkoji hayasaka, also from japan, close to now-fifth-place geoff burns. south africa’sbest ngwenyawas chasing with fellow countrymatesthusio mosiea,nkosinathi duma, andclaude moshiywa. now, indeed, japan and south africa were pushing hard and working with their fellow countrymen. japan’s hideaki yamauchi and south africa’s bongmusa mthembu leading together after the halfway point. around this point in the race, it was easy to identify some men who were still outside the top 10 but looking strong–the runners most likely to move up. these men included sweden’sfritjof fagerlund, italy’sgiorgio calcaterra, and sweden’selov olsson. it was, thus, not long until the south african foursome of best ngwenya, thusio mosiea, nkosinathi duma, and claude moshiywa faded and was passed by these very men. thusio mosiea held things together the best to finish 14th, best ngwenya also finished strong in 16th, nkosinathi duma did not finish, and claude moshiywa slipped way back to 44th. the fact that he’s 46 years old did not prevent italy’s giorgio calcaterra from running to seventh place. then-race leader bongmusa mthembu’s perfect stride and steady gaze suddenly changed with two laps to go. at the 85km point, he looked for the first time like he was working to maintain pace. and by the 92.5k mark, japan’s hideaki yamauchi, also the event’s defending champion, had surged to take over the lead and bongmusa faded, in a replay of their 2016 world championships showdown. hideaki held his lead for the final lap to become the 2018 iau 100k world champion. the race’s dominance by japan was only starting, though, as takehiko gyoba crossed the line in second place, though more than 4.5 minutes behind the winner. bongmusa mthembu held on for third, crossing the line less than a minute later. hideaki yamauchi, 2018 iau 100k world champion. koji hayasaka finished fourth. geoff burns took fifth after emerging at the front of a three-person final sprint between he, nao kazami, and giorgio calcaterra. it was one of the most impressive final efforts we saw all day. the usa’s geoff burns beating japan’s nao kazami to the line in a sprint finish while italy’s giorgio calcaterra also approaches a couple seconds back. these three men took fifth, sixth, and seventh. the back half of the men’s top 10 was exciting until the finish. sixth-place nao kazami had a fascinating race after being in the lead pack, falling to almost 20th place, and coming back to finish sixth. the ageless giorgio calcaterra–he’s actually 46 years old–ran one of the smartest races of the day, being far away from the lead in the early kilometers to finish seventh looking fresh and bright."
"it was a similar story for great britain’santhony clark, who took eighth but waited until the second-to-last lap to move into the top 10–and in doing so he even eluded irunfar’s two sets of race-coverage eyes until his finish. fritjof fagerlund and elov olsson took sweden into the top 10 as they finished in ninth and 10th, respectively. great britain’s anthony clark still had a lot of energy as he took eighth. team race it’s the cumulative time of the top-three finishers of each country that scores the team race. japan was the team gold medalists by a country mile–or shall we say the croatian kilometer. their combined time of 19:37:01 was scored from their teammates finishing in first (hideaki yamauchi), second (takehiko gyoba), and fourth (koji hayasaka) places. despite going out hard and fading some late race, the south african men finished firmly with the silver team medal via a combined time of 20:33:49 from third (bongmusa mthembu), 14th (thusio mosiea), and 16th (best ngwenya) place finishers. germany was the surprise team medalist, and they took bronze with a cumulative time of 21:02:12 from 12th (alexander dautel), 17th (andré collet), and 23rd (karsten fischer) place runners. the 2018 iau 100k world championships men’s individual podium (l-to-r): 3. bongmusa mthembu, 2. takehiko gyoba, 1. hideaki yamauchi individual results team results full results. individual race on the first out-and-backs, it was a monologue of the czech republic’sradka churáňová. she set the pace, looking smooth and opening a small gap to her immediate followers, croatia’s ownnikolina šustić(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and germany’snele alder-baerens(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). all three of them moved independently, however, keeping steady paces and looking at ease with the early kilometers. a bit further back, finland’snoora honkalaheld fourth position and japan’smai fujisawa(post-race interview)showed up in the top five. moving around the back of the top 10 wereluiza tobarfrom brazil,marija vrajićfrom croatia, great britain’ssamantha amend, sweden’skajsa berg, and the usa’sdevon yanko(pre-race interview). early race leader, the czech republic’s radka churáňová, would later fade and drop from the race. germany’s nele alder-baerens ran her own race and took second. croatia’s nikolina šustić, 2018 iau 100k world champion. japan’s mai fujisawa ran a steady race inside the women’s top five all day to take third place. noora honkala, of finland, had a breakout race to finish in eighth place. sweden’s kajsa berg smiling toward her top-10 finish. team race again, it’s the cumulative time of the top-three finishers of each country that scores the team race. the women’s team race wasn’t event close, withjapanan absolute team winner with a23:03:50 total time earned via their third (mai fujisawa), fourth (mikiko ota), and fifth (aiko kanematsu) place finishers. the women of south africa took team silver with a cumulative time of23:56:44 from runners finishing in seventh (salome cooper), 14th (fikile mbuthuma), and 19th (lisa collet). the ‘home team,’ croatia, earned the bronze medal with a cumulative time of24:13:57 via first (nikolina šustić), 18th (veronika jurišić), and 46th (antonija orlić) places. aiko kanematsu, of japan, celebrates her fifth-place finish. individual results team results full results."

"france’sxavier thévenardtook home his third win while italy’sfrancesca canepaearned her first victory atutmb2018. the men’s and women’s fields faced challenging weather conditions paired with hyper-dynamic competition, which together required not only strong physical performances but perhaps even stronger psychological performances of these champions. in the men’s race, emergent romanian runnerrobert hajnalhad the race of his life to take second, while spain’sjordi gamitoracked up perhaps his biggest performance among a number of big performances over the years to take third. for the women, it was spain’suxue frailewho returned from major injury to her previous form to take second, and france’sjocelyne pauly, who battled long and late in a close women’s podium race for third, her top ultra-trail race result by far. in a race that was informed in great part by a decimation of the frontrunner field–especially on the men’s side–it was hard to track exactly how many lead shifts happened over the course of the day or so of alpine trail racing. in our results articles, we typically talk about those who had their best days at the front of the race. with so very many drops among the men’s favorites, a conversation about those who didn’t make it seems warranted, too. first things first, we’ll start at the top of the women’s and men’s fields and, then, work our way down. a special thanks tocamelbakfor making our coverage of utmb possible! thanks also tojaybirdandaltrafor their support of our utmb coverage. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. have you enjoyed our in-depth, pre-, during-, and post-race utmb coverage? well, you, too, can support irunfar! please considerbecoming a monthly supporter of irunfar on patreonormaking a one time donation via paypalin support of our coverage of utmb. we’ve also got some great products in the newirunfar store! your support helps make irunfar happen. thank you! the fog rises above la fouly, switzerland at dawn. photo: irunfar/bryon powell let’s begin with two important and race-informing facts: what a year for the upper-echelon women at utmb! italy’sfrancesca canepa(post-race interview), she’s probably a name that newer fans of international trail ultrarunning don’t recognize. in looking through her decade or so of trail and ultrarunning race results, you might think that on paper she’d reached her ultrarunning peak in the 2012 to 2014 range. for instance, in 2012, she went back-to-back to take second at (one of the weather-shortened versions of) utmb and, then, win tor des géants a couple weeks later. but here we all are in 2018 with a utmb champ in francesca. what we also have in francesca is a woman who didn’t slow down while surrounded by a field of women who did, and her speed and pace results on the race tracker phenomenally demonstrate this. her lowest ranking in the overall field was 157th place at saint-gervais (21km), and her best was at the finish when she was 33rd overall."
"francesca moved inside the women’s top 10 between the descent from col de la seigne into italy (at around 65km) and her hometown of courmayeur (80km). the rest was history as woman by woman, she passed them all, until she arrived to the 135km checkpoint as the women’s leader. her gap to the other women was never big–less than five minutes at the finish–but it was plenty for her arrival as the 2018 champ. francesca canepa at la fouly in switzerland at dawn on saturday, on her way to winning utmb 2018. photo: irunfar/bryon powell i’m not going to lie, spain’suxue fraile(pre-andpost-race interviews) is always a force to be reckoned with. but she’d been injured for a long time, so going into this year’s utmb, i was unsure if she’d be back to her previous form. when i caught a glimpse of her in chamonix a couple days before the race, i was sure she’d compete for the podium. holy smokes, was she fit! early race, uxue was smack dab in the middle of the women’s top 10, in fifth at 21km. from there until about 124km, uxue’s position in the women’s top five shifted around. at les chapieux (50km), she was second, while at grand col ferret (90km), she was fourth. this was the result of women coming and going from in front of her, time and again. she would say after the race that the fluidity with which women moved in front of and, then, behind her was actually sort of confusing, in terms of the sheer number of times it happened and who those runners were. by 140km, she settled into second place, where she would stay. ultimately, she caused a little excitement as she cut over half her deficit to the lead in a couple kilometers over the race’s final 10km, on the steep descent to chamonix from la flégère. but when the route flattened out again with a couple kilometers to go, her pace evened out relative to that of francesca in front of her, and the pair finished about 4.5 minutes apart. uxue fraile elated with second place at utmb 2018. photo: irunfar/bryon powell third-placejocelyne pauly(post-race interview) of france was this year’s women’s breakout runner. she’s been a strong ultrarunner for a number of years, but this was far and away her strongest result–by a country (or alpine?!) mile. a mom and an educator living in the french pyrenees, jocelyne was unaffected by the difficult weather conditions which persisted for most of the first 12 hours of the race, including rain, frozen precipitation, and cold temperatures. as early as 21km into the race, jocelyne was well inside the top 10. she said after the race that this positioning surprised her, but that she went with it since it felt good. she was still outside podium position at the start of the final climb, and once she moved her way into third place, she said that her competitive instinct made her want to fight for that spot."
"the women’s podium of utmb 2018 (l-to-r): 2. uxue fraile, 1. francesca canepa, 3. jocelyne pauly. photo: irunfar/bryon powell fourth place was the u.k.’sbeth pascall, who put on what looks like a textbook performance, running outside the women’s top 10 to start, easing into it mid-race, before coming on strong in the final 25km to move up from seventh to fourth place. rounding out the women’s top five was italy’skatia fori, who was one of those people whose position in the race moved around, from higher, to lower, to higher, and to lower again. at one point she was actually leading the race before she ultimately finished fifth. katia fori running toward fifth place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell in sixth was france’sjuliette blanchet, who avenged last year’s dnf with a strong 2018 finish. seventh place was the always-impressiveildikó wermescher(post-race interview) of hungary. the usa’scat bradleytook eighth. bulgaria’smariya nikolova(pre-race interview) took ninth for the second year in a row. the usa’skaci lickteig, who sat outside the women’s top 10 until the final kilometers, sprinted it in for 10th place. drops were an influential part of the storyline of both the women’s and men’s races, though as we shall see below, the dnf influence was really heavy among the men. irunfar had 34 women in its preview who actually ended up starting the race, and i believe that 12 of them didn’t finish, a 35% drop rate. there were 782 dnfs among 2,561 total starters, a 31% overall drop rate. so the frontrunner women’s dnf rate was a little higher than the average drop rate for the whole field. interestingly, seven of those 12 women were from the usa. mimmi kotka was one of the women’s favorites, but she dropped in les contamines, early in the race. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. to be honest, i think a number of us wondered aboutxavier thévenard’s(pre-andpost-race interviews) ability to recover from both those 91 miles of the hardrock 100 that he did run as well as the psychological outwash of the nine miles he didn’t with his disqualification a scant six weeks ago. but if there was any lingering fatigue, you couldn’t see it. he was solid all day long, not only efficient in his trail time, but also efficient in his aid-station transitions. and he also kept his cool as lead change after lead change happened around him until there was just him left. sometimes it’s hard to tell if xavier enjoys what he does when he’s out there–he’s a quiet guy who keeps his thoughts to himself and the emotions off his face. but he let his feelings out at the finish with a sweet celebration. at the outset and for something like half the race, xavier sat in the middle of the top 10. then, from about midway up until the 50-kilometers-to-go mark, he moved up until he eventually was the solo race leader starting at champex-lac (124km). his lead was modest at first, but he really opened it up in the final race segments, ultimately winning by some 45 minutes."
"xavier thévenard, utmb 2018 champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell second-placerobert hajnal(post-race interview), of romania… wait, stop the ‘press.’ who’s that? i know, i know, irunfar has a small yet passionate collection of romanian readers who did know of this guy before this weekend, but the rest of us, let’s get to know robert. i took notice of him when he finished 15th at the 2018 trail world championships, but his accolades go farther back than that. last year, he earned a pair of fifth places at the lavaredo ultra trail and ultra-trail cape town. the first time robert caught my attention at this race was in the dark, cold, wind, and below-freezing temperatures on the descent from col de la seigne on the border of france and italy, at about 65km. he was bundled up enough that it was hard to figure out who he was while he ran just outside of the men’s top 10. the next time we saw him in the bustling courmayeur aid station (80km), he’d passed a bunch of people and moved solidly into the lead group. that’s where he stayed all day, moving up sequentially until, after 124km, he found his ultimate finishing position. our eyes are squarely on you now, robert. what’s your next move? robert hajnal after taking second at utmb 2018. photo: irunfar/bryon powell spain’sjordi gamito(post-race interview) has a lot of feathers of success adorning his trail-ultrarunning hat from the last half-decade-plus of high-level ultrarunning. i believe he had two previous finishes of 12th and 10th places at utmb to his name, as well as podium finishes at other important races. at the finish line, jordi said that earning a utmb podium position was like a dream to him, something he’d thought a lot about, but thought he might never achieve. well, jordi, dreams do come true! like xavier and robert in front of him, jordi started out a little conservatively, and got closer to the front of the race as time went on. he found his third-place position with about 60km to go, and he never was closely challenged for it, nor did he challenge for a higher ranking. this year, the podium is his. jordi gamito celebrates his third place with the crowd gathered at the utmb 2018 finish line. photo: irunfar/bryon powell here we go, norway’shallvard schjølberg, who are you? he’s the dude who took 28th place at utmb last year and fourth place this year. talk about some improvement! hallvard was a quintessential honey badger, never really caring about or being bothered by difficult conditions, soldiering on in it all. rounding out the men’s top five was the u.k.’sdamian hall(post-race interview). check out his utmb progression: 29th in 2015, 19th in 2016, 12th last year, and, now, this. with such significant leaps forward, the only question is what his utmb ceiling might be. damian hall on his way to fifth place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell sixth place was latvianroman evarts, who turned up in the men’s top 10 at 124km, after running over half the race in 20th-30th place overall."
"seventh was italy’sstefano ruzza, who employed the same move-up strategy, though not entering the top 10 until even later.erik clavery, of france, surprised me. i tend to think of him as a relatively aggressive runner who sometimes sticks it and sometimes doesn’t. i was, thus, surprised to see him taking it easier early and running around 20th place before watching him turn up in the top 10 later in the race. austria’sflorian graselfinished ninth, and spain’sjavi domingueztook 10th. to put it mildly, there were some dnfs in the men’s field. at quick count, it looks like there were 25 drops from the 39 men in our preview who ultimately started the race, or a 64% drop rate among irunfar’s men’s favorites. this statistic sits in stark contrast to the race’s overall drop rate of 31%. some of those drops were the result of weird stuff, like a pre-race bee sting that manifested in mid-race health issues for three-time championkilian jornet, as well as during-race slips, trips, and ankle rolls that created race-ending injuries fortim tollefson(pre-race interview) who’s taken third at utmb twice, previous second-place-finisherluis alberto hernando(pre-race interview), andalex nicholswho was debuting at utmb but who has a plenty-strong racing resume. this is a significant number, sure, but there’s still much more to the story, and that has to be the general wear and tear of running 100 miles in difficult weather conditions catching up with a lot of men, including two-time top-10erzach miller(pre-race interview) who i also think hurt his ankle after going into the energetic hurt bucket,jim walmsley(pre-race interview) who was fifth last year, three-time top-10ergediminus grinius,scotty hawkerwho was last year’s 11th-place finisher, and more. jim walmsley running at 21k into utmb 2018 before his dnf. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. it takes a village! thank you so much to our office and field teams for forgoing sleep, putting in hundreds of miles of driving and hiking to report from remote locations, standing on frozen mountainsides for hours on end, and staring at computers all night and day. we are so grateful to kirsten kortebein, marissa harris, mauri pagliacci, casey szesze, tim peeters, kate cooke, eóin lennon, gaël revelin, fabrice van de cauter, tom van de cauter, antonio gassi, rebecca gassi, cass chisholm, fabrizio lavuri, martina demateo, amy leedham, and braden engel! related articles:"
"the 25th edition of thehardrock 100took place on july 20th to the 22nd, 2018 in the san juan mountains of colorado under the rocky mountains’ typically tempestuous monsoon-season skies. event participants had 48 hours to traverse the 100.5-mile loop made up of dirt roads, old mining trails, singletrack, and game trails at an average altitude of 11,000 feet and accumulating 33,000-plus feet of climb. the run switches direction each year, and ‘even’ years like this one bring about the clockwise direction of travel. following the disqualification of all-race leaderxavier thévenard(pre-race interview) for receiving aid outside of an aid station in violation of event rules,jeff browning(pre– andpost-raceinterviews) took home the men’s win. thévenard’s dq was a first in the history of the event and, perhaps almost unbelievably, the first of two dqs at this year’s running.

"even so, his lead on the men’s field continued to increase, such that at sherman, mile 72, he was more than 90 minutes ahead of anyone else. thévenard arrived at the cunningham aid station, mile 91, at the race’s lead, too. however, at cunningham, thévenard was disqualified after discussions with the race organization about a confirmed rules breach back before the course’s halfway point, two miles after the ouray aid station, mile 44, where he was aided by his crew with ice and water, which is disallowed by the event’s rules. xavier thévenard at grouse gulch, mile 58, of the 2018 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks after the event, race directordale garlandtold irunfar that following a bystander report of a possible rules breach, the organization researched what happened, asked questions of both thévenard and his crew at three different aid stations–two of these interactions were observed by irunfar–and conferred with the organization’s rules committee before the incident’s culmination in cunningham gulch. post-event, thévenard told irunfar that he, indeed, admits to taking aid outside an aid station, but that he felt the disqualification was a disproportionate penalty for the rule he broke.tony russwas the bystander who reported the rules breach to the race organization, and he told irunfar after the event that he observed thévenard receiving aid in the form of water to drink and his crew members doing something with his pack. [editor’s note:we have publishedanother articlewhich details this disqualification. we have been told by the race organization that they have plans to release a more in-depth report, as well.] as all this happened,jeff browning(pre– andpost-raceinterviews), who had run in second place nearly the whole day (and night), went through the maggie gulch aid station, mile 85, thinking he was, indeed, in second place. however, when he arrived to cunningham a bit later, he found himself at the head of the race. not only that but second-placejeff rome(post-race interview) was hot on his heels, leaving the cunningham aid station just 6.5 minutes behind. the gentlemen could both see the other and hear the small gathered crowd’s early morning cheering for both of them. a race of the jeffs was on. but we should back up, say, 91 miles. as early as the mineral creek crossing, mile 2, jeff browning crossed in second place with a long tail of men trailing him. this pattern continued for miles, with what looked like browning doing his thing and that thing amounting to him essentially leading the men’s chase pack. while he mostly looked at ease in his effort, he would later say that he both felt the fact that he ran the western states 100 just four weeks ago and that he struggled with motivation because he couldn’t make up time on the lead. after the race, he also said he got confused for a spell in the vicinity of cataract lake, mile 75, when he couldn’t see course markings and wandered back and forth for a bit. hisgpstracker indicates his wanderings amounted to perhaps 2.5 extra miles."
"browning eventually encounteredtroy howard(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) who was at the time in third place, approaching from behind. together they sorted his confusion, and headed on. browning said he surged in the miles following his encounter with howard to gain a new gap. jeff browning at the top of the first climb, at mile 7, during the 2018 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/alex mcgeorge jeff rome turned heads at hardrock last year when he finished in seventh place in 28:53. he would say after the race that his goal this year was to run under 28 hours. by 18 miles into the race, rome was courting with the men’s top 10 and, at telluride, mile 28, he settled into seventh position, the same position he finished in 2017 and a position he’d hold until after mile 58. and, then, the magic started happening as he moved up from seventh to third in the 27 miles that followed. he, too, was surprised to arrive to cunningham and find out that, not only was he in second place, but he was also just a few minutes off the lead. he went up the final climb chasing jeff browning as hard as he could. in the end, the two jeffs maintained their order, with jeff browning as the men’s champion and jeff rome in second place, a huge step up from his original goal. jeff rome takes second at the 2018 hardrock 100 in a finish sprint. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks troy howard(pre-race interview) is slowly filling out all the finishing positions at the front of hardrock. he came into this year’s race with two prior second-place finishes and a fifth, too. in a cursory way, howard’s and rome’s early races went similarly with howard also occupying space in the back half of the men’s top 10 before moving forward in the rankings as the race went on. grouse gulch, the mile 58 aid station, seemed to serve as a hinge point between the first half of howard’s race and its second half. there, he arrived in sixth place, but transitioned in and out of the aid station faster than a whole bunch of people, leaving in third. from there until after mile 72, howard held that spot, though after that he was passed by jeff rome and was running in fourth place. after thévenard’s disqualification, he moved up into and stayed in podium position until the finish. another hardrock paced hardrock solid from start to finish for howard. benjamin bucklinandjesse haynestook fourth and fifth, respectively. notable among the rest of the men’s field,blake woodearned his 22nd finish, andkirk apttook home number 24. troy howard (left) rolling into grouse gulch, mile 58, at dusk on friday night in the 2018 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. let’s tell it how it is: this race was thesabrina stanley(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) show from start to finish. stanley went immediately to the front of the women’s race, crossing mineral creek at mile 2 ahead of the other women."
"from here to about mile 28, stanley ran just a couple minutes in front, such that the ladies caught sight of each other from time to time. stanley said after that the race that catching sight of another woman behind her at the chapman gulch aid station, mile 18, encouraged her to put a strong effort on the climb out of the gulch. from telluride, mile 28, to ouray, mile 44, stanley more than doubled her lead and arrived with an almost-half-hour gap. however, though she always remained handily in front of the women’s field, the gap between she and second place shrunk to 13 minutes again at grouse gulch, mile 58. but then the rest was really history, as at every location from which we reported from there to the finish, stanley increased her gap on second place and her win was by 55 minutes. immediately at the finish and resoundingly the day after too, stanley stated she intended to use the entry into next year’s race that she earned by winning. sabrina stanley 11.5 miles into her dominant win of the 2018 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/ashley saloga and scout phillips steady as she goes,nikki kimball(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) took second place in her hardrock debut, though she and third-placedarla askew(post-race interview) leap frogged each other a couple times as far as we observed, and who knows how many others, before their ultimate two-three finish. at mile 7, atop the first climb of the race, askew and kimball ran together, though kimball would gap askew on the long downhill to the kt aid station at mile 11.5. nikki kimball looking thrilled with second place at the 2018 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks from that point until after telluride, mile 28, kimball ran a few minutes ahead of askew. the pair flip-flopped again on the climb up after telluride, with askew arriving to the famous kroger’s canteen aid station, mile 33, up above 13,000 feet elevation, in second again. askew maintained that second-place position until somewhere after sherman aid station, mile 72. when we next saw the duo at maggie gulch aid station, mile 85, kimball had put 14 minutes on askew, and the pair would complete the journey back to the start/finish in silverton in this order. make that six finishes now for askew! darla askew in a high moment at grouse gulch, mile 58. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks japan’skaori niwa(pre-race interview) took fourth andlise plantierrounded out the women’s top five. notable among the women’s race, 11 of the 14 women who started finished.liz bauerhit the 10-finish mark,betsy nyeher 16th, and andbetsy kalmeyerher 19th. kaori niwa at the top of the first climb, mile 7, in the 2018 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/alex mcgeorge full results. photos and video coming soon, check back. articles coming soon, check back. race reports coming soon, check back. we are a big team of volunteers who worked a couple hundred hours total to bring you our hardrock 100 coverage!"

"on a hot-weather day on thewestern states 100course—where the midday heat registered 97 degrees fahrenheit at the race’s 62-mile point and then 106 degrees at the mile-78 river crossing—winnersjim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andcourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) alighted fires of their own. jim set a new men’s course record and courtney finished in the second-fastest time ever by a woman. in the balance of this article, we’ll break down jim’s and courtney’s outstanding performances as well as what else happened at the front of the men’s and women’s fields. the irunfar team was at the start, finish, and 16 spots along the 100-mile course! read on for splits, quotes, early analysis, and more collated from the team’s observations. we’ve also collected additional resources in our2018 western states post-race roundup. a special thanks todrymaxfor once again making our coverage of the western states 100 possible! thanks also tobuff®andjaybirdfor their support of our western states coverage. you,the irunfar reader, can help support us, too… just check outour summer fund driveto find a few options for supporting our work! to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com, subscribe toour daily email updatesorour rss feed. hot! hot! hot! it was 106f/42c or higher in the shade at the river crossing at 4 p.m. photo: irunfar/bryon powell hot! hot! hot! it was 106f/42c or higher in the shade at the river crossing at 4 p.m. photo: irunfar/bryon powell it was a special day in the 2018 western states 100 men’s race, with not only a stout men’s race overall, but also a new course record set byjim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). let’s look at both storylines individually. jim walmsley’s western states 100 course record this was well and truly one for the record books. jim walmsley set a new western states 100 course record of 14:30:04. it behooves us to equally well and truly break down how he did it. let’s do this. in his pre-race interview, jim said he was looking at a 15-hour race, meaning his plan was to run at a swift but not unheard-of-before-at-western-states pace. at the finish line, he additionally added that his spilt sheet called for a 14:53 finish. jim took the first 15 miles positively chill—and according to plan, it seems—arriving to red star ridge (mile 15) four minutes over course-record pace. almost 15 miles later at the robinson flat aid station (mile 30), he had picked up a little steam as he was two minutes under record pace. from there, though, the plan must have gone out the window as he positively let it rip. jim walmsley floating into robinson flat in the lead. photo: irunfar/bryon powell jim walmsley floating into robinson flat in the lead. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at dusty corners (mile 38), he ran through at a full 16 minutes under, gaining 14 minutes on record pace in 7.7 miles. ahem. did you get that? at devil’s thumb (mile 48), he was, again, 14 minutes under. michigan bluff (mile 56) 16 under. foresthill (mile 62) 19 under."
"it went on like this until the rucky chucky river crossing (mile 78) when he passed through 26 minutes under record pace, what we believe was his maximal gap under record pace. the irunfar team consistently reported that jim spent minutes at a time in the aid stations. that is, anywhere from three-to-five-minute stays were regular for him. he’d sit, take off his shoes, get iced and watered down, and feed. regular stays of this frequency in aid are more of a european thing than an american one, so it struck us as notable. perhaps jim is starting yet another american ultra trend? and perhaps hidden in this strategy was the rest time which enabled him to sustain such fast running paces when he was on the trail? interesting, certainly, and worthy of future consideration. from the river crossing (mile 78), he began to give time back, but not so much that it ever seemed his record finish was in danger. of course, because of his 2016 effort here, we all held our breaths when he went in the river and again when he was on his way to that crucial left turn. jim said at the finish that he hung onto the rope whilst crossing the river and that there were two spectators awaiting him at that left turn. just when we thought jim’s passage was free and clear of obstacles, word came in that he was delayed by a mother black bear and her two cubs somewhere before the pointed rocks aid station (mile 94). jim surprised the trio, the cubs treed themselves, and mama stayed nearby in protection. after a couple minutes, he was able to pass. now, finally, it was just jim and the last few miles of the western states trail. when he arrived to the finish in 14:30:04, he won by a massive margin and was 16 minutes and 40 seconds under the previous course record of 14:46:44. at the finish, jim said that getting the record hurt and that “tim [olson, the previous record holder,] is a bad, bad man.” mark it in the record books: jim put together mind and body in near-perfect synergy to run his heart out and inspire a community of ultrarunners. i don’t know whose emotions were stronger at the finish (and perhaps around the ultrarunning world following online), jim’s or everyone else’s. it’s a massive pleasure to see such a look of satisfaction on his face. jim did it! photo: irunfar/bryon powell jim did it! photo: irunfar/bryon powell the rest of the men’s race after the race for the win and course record, there was still a boatload of men’s racing going on. next, we point out the start-to-finish steady effort of france’sfrançois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) for a distinct honorable mention. françois went out at nearly the front of the men’s pack, running basically the whole race in one podium position or another, and settled into his ultimate second-place position before reaching the robinson flat aid station (mile 30)."
"over and over, our team reported that essentially françois never looked amazing, but never looked poorly either. he just ticked off the miles until he arrived at the finish. he would say at the finish line that the runnable, hot, and dusty miles around the dusty corners aid station (mile 38) were his hardest. his 15:54:53, while quite far from winner jim walmsley, remains an excellent finish time that sits amongst the best second-place times in the history of this race. françois d’haene is a machine. he once again got it done at the 100-mile distance this weekend. photo: irunfar/bryon powell françois d’haene is a machine. he once again got it done at the 100-mile distance this weekend. photo: irunfar/bryon powell last year,mark hammond(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished third. this year, mark hammond finished third. enough said. just kidding, there’s a lot more to say! what is really the deal with mark? because he doesn’t look hot or sweaty or tired in the heat of the day while racing 100 miles, i’d like to have what he’s having. mark put himself in the back of the men’s top 10 by red star ridge (mile 6), ran some 35 more miles while gently ticking off places until he was in third when we saw him at michigan bluff (mile 56). our field reporters from there out frequently and independently reported on how-strong-and-somehow-not-affected-by-the-heat mark seemed. he’s nailed it with these two third places on the international 100-mile stage, though his 16:08:59 this year was about 45 minutes faster than last year’s finish in what will likely be called by the ws 100 weather pundits similarly difficult conditions. [update, june 25:the punditry is now in and this year was the ninth-hottest year in race history.] it’s now two-straight third-place finishes at western states for mark hammond. photo: irunfar/bryon powell it’s now two-straight third-place finishes at western states for mark hammond. photo: irunfar/bryon powell it’s probably not fair to always compare guys likeian sharmanandjeff browning(pre-race interview) with each other. yes, they employ similar race tactics but, yes, they are their own human beings with their own unique takes on how to enact their similar strategies. even still, the pair finished four-five, respectively. my, oh my, was ian in shape this year! you could see it early, as he was running further up in the men’s field earlier, and he looked peppy in body and confident in mind. when ian crossed the finish line in fourth, he earned his ninth-straight top-10 men’s finish, and matched his previous best performance of fourth place in 16:20 in 2013… with a fourth place in 16:23. mr. consistent doesn’t even begin to precisely reflect ian’s, ahem, precision. 2018 m7 becomes 2019 m4; see you next year! don’t get into a walk off (or run off) with ian sharman. photo: irunfar/bryon powell don’t get into a walk off (or run off) with ian sharman. photo: irunfar/bryon powell jeff browning finishes western states for the fourth time, this year taking fifth and following up on a fourth place last year and third the year before."
"that might sound like a descending trend on paper, but i don’t think it can be considered as such because, in actuality, a 16:45 run in this year’s weather seems like a step up on last year’s 17:32 in also-nasty conditions. at this juncture, jeff browning said he was going hunting… and that he did. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at this juncture, jeff browning said he was going hunting… and that he did. photo: irunfar/bryon powell in the second half of the men’s top 10, it waskyle“the race starts in foresthill, right?”pietari, who used his leg speed to surge in the very last mile to his ultimate sixth-place position.cody reedtook seventh, and i’m not sure if he puked on the course—anyone want to let us know?—but my heart felt for cody because his face at foresthill (mile 62) looked like how mid-race puking can feel. puke face or just a general 100-miles-is-a-long-way face, cody held tough to finish seventh, a super-successful first-100-mile finish for him.charlie waretook eighth, looking comfortable and focused all day.paul giblin(post-race interview) took ninth for the second year in a row, giving himself a trio of top-10 finishes. andkris brown(pre-race interview) rounded out the ultimate top-10 position. a bit further back, but incredibly impressively, 73-years-oldnick bassettis now the oldest western states 100 finisher ever. he ran 29:09:42 this weekend.ray piva, was previously the oldest-ever western states finisher back in 1998 at the age of 71, six days shy of his 72nd birthday. charlie ware? this is charlie ware… who just took eighth at western states. photo: irunfar/bryon powell charlie ware? this is charlie ware… who just took eighth at western states. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full men’s results. check outvideos of the top-three men finishing. australia’slucy bartholomew(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took the women’s race out hot! at the escarpment (mile 3.5), the race’s high point, lucy went over the top basically in the company of the top men. and at duncan canyon aid station (mile 24), she’d built an eight-minute lead over the other women. over the course of the race’s first half, she established, held, and, then, lapsed a lead over the rest of the women’s field. she also hovered not so far from course-record pace before dropping below it and, then, finally slowing down compared to it. lucy running into robinson flat in the lead. photo: irunfar/bryon powell lucy running into robinson flat in the lead. photo: irunfar/bryon powell as lucy was easing off the gas, its seems thatcourtney dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was only getting warmed up. for fascinating comparison, as early as duncan canyon, courtney was almost 18 minutes behind lucy and not even in second place yet. the pass between this pair happened somewhere between the devil’s thumb and michigan bluff aid stations (miles 48 and 56). when our team saw courtney at foresthill (mile 62), it was clear that this race was now hers to lose. courtney dauwalter climbing to michigan bluff shortly after taking the lead. photo: irunfar/bryon powell courtney dauwalter climbing to michigan bluff shortly after taking the lead."
"photo: irunfar/bryon powell more fun facts, at foresthill, courtney was 34 minutes off record pace. at the finish, she was about 40 minutes off record pace. second-half closer anyone? when courtney crossed the auburn, california finish line in 17:27:00, hers became the second-fastest finish in race history, only bested byellie greenwood’s16:47:19 course record. the moniker ‘any distance, any surface’ fits courtney perfectly, and she proved she can motor hard on the hot, dusty, flatter western states trail with not a trouble in the world. kaytlyn gerbin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who finished fourth last year by a conservative, move-up-late strategy, went out harder this year. where she was in the teens place-wise last year, kaytlyn was already in the middle of things and in seventh at the robinson flat aid station (mile 30). seventh at mile 30 was kaytlyn’s version of a conservative start this year, perhaps, as a woman on an elevated running plane from one year ago. she inched up bit by bit such that she was in fourth by foresthill (mile 62) and then second by pointed rocks (mile 94), the position she held through the finish. it’s official—if for some reason it already wasn’t—kaytlyn gerbin has gone big time. kaytlyn gerbin improved on a great 2017 race in 2018. photo: irunfar/bryon powell kaytlyn gerbin improved on a great 2017 race in 2018. photo: irunfar/bryon powell all of that earlier discussion about lucy slowing up and losing the lead approaching the race’s halfway point in distance, the woman held her own, crossing the line in a solid third place. this marks an outstanding 100-mile debut by an incredible young athlete already on the rise. does it seem that the sky is the limit for lucy, or is that just me? lucy going lunar at the finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell lucy going lunar at the finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell amanda bashamdoes it again, backing up her fourth-place finish from two years ago with another one of them this year. like the other women who started meaning business off the line, amanda was in the women’s top 10 for what we think must have been the whole race. even in the day’s harshest and hottest conditions, amanda passed us looking calm, speaking lucidly, and just in it. amanda basham added another ws 100 fourth place to her collection. photo: irunfar/bryon powell amanda basham added another ws 100 fourth place to her collection. photo: irunfar/bryon powell cecilia flori, the italian living in new zealand who has been tearing up the kiwi trail-ultra scene of late, ripped it up over here, too. for the first 20 or so miles, cecilia ran outside the women’s top 10, before climbing into it by duncan canyon (mile 24). the rest of the race seemed to involve her running steady, moving up not only through the overall field but also in the women’s field such that she crossed the line in fifth. with cecilia’s finish, that makes two 100-mile debuts in the women’s top five. cecilia flori ran a consistent race to take fifth."

"spain’sluis alberto hernandoand the netherlands’sragna debatstook home individual gold medals at the 2018trail world championships, which began in castellón de la plana, spain. the unique course featured net climbing, a real mix of runnable as well as steep and technical terrain, and a second half that was way more difficult than the first. throw in some high humidity (though cool air temperatures) courtesy of the region’s mediterreanean climate, and we have plentiful tough racing conditions at hand. in the men’s race, two-time defending champion luis quietly shadowed the front of the field for the race’s first half, stayed there when men started slowing, and attacked on the tech-y and steep terrain with a little over 20 kilometers left to run. ragna set the pace in the women’s race for most of the day, while other women tried but ultimately failed to match her effort. she broke clear of the rest of the field after the halfway point, running with smooth strength to her first trail world championships victory. in the team race, team spain–the home team–took home resounding, unchallenged gold in both the men’s and women’s races. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back. like what we’re doing? we’re independent media covering trail running and ultrarunning around the world. help make our coverage of this and other races possible bybecoming a monthly supporter of irunfar on patreonormaking a one time donation via paypal. thank you! to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. i mean, couldn’t we all see it coming? he patiently bides his time and watches the field, waits until his competitors begin to slow, hammers some section of the course, and becomes the trail world champion. spain’sluis alberto hernando(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) did it again, pretty much the same way for a third year in a row. not gonna’ lie, he put on a helluva’ entertaining show in doing so. this year, luis ran within close contact of the lead through the halfway point, a little village called atzeneta some 41 kilometers into the race. there, he passed through town in fourth position. just 11km after that, he’d moved up to second and you could tell it was only a matter of time until he would take over the lead. by 65km in the race, luis had a two-plus minute lead over the rest of the field and it only grew from there. strong as ever, in winning the 2018 edition and at the age of 40, he becomes a three-time trail world champion. but we should back up a little, into the early race story. though several men pushed the early race pace, the usa’szach miller(pre-race interview,post-race report) was perhaps pushing the most. zach looked solid until suddenly he didn’t any longer. at 41km into the race, zach sat about 30 seconds ahead of the rest of the men’s field. when we saw him 11km later, he was at the race’s helm by a full 3.5 minutes."
"was he pushing the pace here? however, another 10km after that, zach had climbed on the struggle bus, citing dehydration as his issue. he lost the lead after the 62km point, forging ahead as best as he could and ultimately finishing in eighth position. after the race, he said that his strategy was a gamble. indeed, it was. el rey, luis alberto hernando, on his way to his third-straight world championships win. photo: irunfar/bryon powell spain’scristofer clemente(post-race interview) is a guy who at no time would i want behind me in a race. i seriously don’t know another runner out there who can strategically pace himself as well as cristofer does. and, just like luis’s repeat style, cristofer was also back this year with his extreme late-race move-up strategy. can we look at his placing at each of the aid stations? 72nd, 54th, 42nd, 27th, 13th, fifth, second, second, and second. good grief! when i first saw cristofer at 16.5km, he seemed further back in the field this year than last year. and looking at the stats, indeed this was true. at 9km into the 2017 race, he was in 31st. but then each time we saw him this year, he’d moved up through the field and looked completely comfortable in doing so. in the rocky, tough, steep terrain between the 52km and 62km villages-atop-mountains of benefigos and vistabella, where a lot of runners fell back, cristofer advanced from 13th to fifth position. and just another 8km later, he moved into his ultimate second-place position. what a masterful performance. cristofer clemente once again was muy inteligente in working his way up to second at the trail world championships. photo: irunfar/bryon powell it was hard to get a read on just how good great britain’stom evans(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was without actually seeing him race. on paper, his steadily emergent performances over a short period of time looked stout, but where did his top-end potential lie? turns out, this guy’s good in person, too. ahead of the race, tom said he came here to go big and that, while he hoped it would go well, he knew it might not. as such, i wasn’t surprised to see him put himself right near the lead from the get go. in fact, in the seven times we saw him during the race, we never saw him out of podium position. if cristofer gets an award for being the best closer, then tom gets another for his start-to-finish placing consistency. did he ever have a bad spell where his pace lapsed? what’s left to really say about tom’s breakout third place? there’s a boat load of talent here, and i gotta’ hope he’ll do something like a slower burn over the years to keep it sustainable, because i can see him going great places. tom evans continued his ascent in trail running by taking third. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks great britain’sjon albonhad this quiet demeanor about him on the course. he just put his head down, answered to no one, and ran his own race."
"another easy starter, he didn’t actually come onto our radar in the race until about the halfway point when he had moved up into the top 10. but in the next 10km, he put the pedal to the metal and popped through benefigos at 52km in fifth place. he’d move up one more position as zach lapsed backward later in the race to finish fourth. jonathan albon helping team gb to a silver medal. photo: irunfar/bryon powell with his fifth-place finish here, france’sludovic pommeret(pre-race interview) has now finished fifth at the trail world championships three times. and the other time he was sixth place. sheesh, take that one to las vegas. i’d put a bet on that. the usa’smario mendozawas right there all day. last year, he finished as top american and just inside the top 10, and so it’s easy to imagine he was hungry for more. when things got hard in the last kilometers, mario stayed strong, continuing to move up late to finish sixth place and, again, top american. like mario, france’sromain maillardwas there all day, too. for much of the race, we saw him working and running with his fellow french teammates. in the end, he finished seventh, putting a second french runner in to the top 10. czechia’sjiří čípaproved that this top-10 run at this race last year was no fluke by finishing ninth this year. germany’sjanosch kowalczykrounded out the men’s top 10. just call him predictable pommeret. photo: irunfar/bryon powell team spain took this win with ease. with men finishing in first (luis alberto hernando), second (cristofer clemente), and, then, 13th position viapablo villa, they were basically untouchable. going into the race, it seemed like multiple men would have to foible for team great britain to not take home a medal, but i admit to a little surprise with not only their silver, but with the strength of the team’s performance. after their third- and fourth-place finishers (tom evans and jon albon),ryan smith, a great britain citizen who lives in the usa, took 16th and sealed the deal on the silver team medal. team france goes home with the bronze. going into the race, they were a team favorite, but they just didn’t put it together on the day. in addition to their fifth- and seventh-place finishers (ludovic pommeret and romain maillard), their third team scorer wasadrien michaudin 19th. don’t get between mario mendoza and the finish line late in the trail world championships. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. a very happy tom erik halvorsen of norway. photo: irunfar/bryon powell i’m just going to say it.ragna debats(post-race interview), of the netherlands but who lives in spain, made winning the trail world championships look easy. from start to finish, she just looked so smooth. when asked about this after the race, she said that all the hard work was done ahead of time and that all was left was to enjoy the race day. she also said that the pace felt easy for her. hmn, imagine that!?"
"early on in the race, ragna made her way to the front. by the time we first saw her at 16.5 kilometers into the race, she was leading. though a couple women would come and go before and after that, she was always right there at the lead. between the 41km and 52km aid stations, ragna increased her gap on the field from a mere 20 seconds to almost two minutes. let’s cut to the chase, though, her gains were just beginning. her 16-minute win was a huge one in this deep field. ragna was third at the 2016 trail world championships and fourth last year, and this marks a big step up for her again. ragna debats running with the focus of a trail world champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell spain’slaia cañes(post-race interview) has been racing trail ultramarathons for several years, but her performances in the last year have been on another level. to elaborate, two years ago she was 19that the trail world championships, last year she was seventh, and now this, a second-place finish. i feel like her finish at the trail world champs last year was her notice to the world to really watch out. laia was cheered for vibrantly all over the course, and that’s because she lives locally, which added another benefit for her. i think she knew the course well. laia opened the race by running the first 40km in the second half of the women’s top 10 before moving into the front half of the top 10 in the race’s second part. her strategy would not end there, though, as she continued to move up–all the way into second position. her jubilance at the finish made it clear that she was more than elated with a second-place finish in this field. laia cañes is ecstatic after taking second in front of her home crowd. photo: irunfar/bryon powell france’sclaire mougel(post-race interview) is admittedly a runner who i knew almost nothing about except for researching her ahead of this race. much like tom evans’s international breakout on the men’s side, this race should serve notice that claire can compete on an international level as well. reportedly, coming into the race, she said she had no plan or goal, that she only aimed to go out and run her own race. claire appeared inside the women’s top 10 for the first time at useres, a small town located 31km into the race. the light switch turned on for claire between 52km and 62km, however, and in this short distance but across mostly difficult terrain, she moved up from eighth to fourth place. one more position she would climb from there, up onto the women’s podium, which she would hold to the finish. now that she has had this breakout, i’m excited to see where claire, a national-level nordic skier, takes her trail running. france’s claire mougel made herself known to the world with her performance. photo: irunfar/bryon powell spain’sgemma arenashad a strong start-to-finish performance in taking fourth."
"given that her finish last year was off her capability and way back in 25th place and given that her run this year was a crucial lever in the team spain machine’s gold medal, gemma has to feel good about this run. gemma arenas striding out on a smoother section of course. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks spain’smaite maiora(pre-race interview) might have summarized her performance best to us at the final aid station of collao, 78km, when she said that she had given the race her absolute best. she started the race outside the women’s top 10, but gradually worked her self into it and up into her ultimate fifth-place position. ever a competitor, maite maiora seems to be racing with more pleasure of late. photo: irunfar/bryon powell while it was another polish runner in the women’s top 10 for the first half of the race (that wasedyta lewandowskawho ultimately finished 15th),magdalena łaczakmoved up into the women’s top 10 in the second half to finish sixth, smiling each time we saw her. women’s defending champion, france’sadeline roche(pre-race interview) had an injury-shortened training block prior to the race. she ended up in seventh place. the usa’sclare gallagher(pre-race interview) had a roller-coaster race, running inside the top 10 early, falling back mid-race, and putting things back together to surge into the top 10 in the final 15km, in the end finishing eighth.holly pageled team great britain with her ninth-place finish, whilekaytlyn gerbinput a second member of team usa into the top 10. ain’t no one touching the spanish this year. they robbed the bank of gold with the second-, fourth-, and fifth-place finishes of laia cañes,gemma arenas, and maite maiora. after several years of golds, team france took away a silver medal this year via claire mougel finishing third, adeline roche taking seventh, andamandine ferratoending up in 14th position. team usa, what a finish they had to earn their team bronze. the scoring team members were clare gallagher (eighth), kaytlyn gerbin (10th), andsabrina little(12th). team usa’s clare gallagher (left) and kaytlyn gerbin (right) greet sabrina little on their way to a team bronze. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. holly page proudly raises the union jack after a strong race. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thanks to mauri pagliacci and kirsten kortebein for assisting with our on-the-ground coverage! related articles:"

"it wasn’t far into the race when mario slid into third place and stayed there. while it seems that the front packs in trail ultrarunning these days are dynamic and changing from start to finish, this year the men’s and women’s lake sonoma podium settled out early and stuck, mario included. he, like everyone, struggled a bit in the midday heat, and said post-race that the importance of heat training ahead of western states in june was definitely underscored by this weekend’s sun. mario mendoza on his way to his second third-place finish at lake sonoma in three years. photo: irunfar/bryon powell eric senseman(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) got a golden ticket to western states, too! the dude’s excitement upon arriving to the finish line in fourth place and in golden ticket territory was thoroughly infectious. before the race, eric said he planned to temper himself early before racing in the second half–i think he said, “don’t be surprised if i’m in eighth at half way.”–so i was a little nervous to see him running in fourth place as early as mile 12. in the end, there was no reason to worry as eric held strong and put time on everyone in the field behind him in the race’s final 12 miles, crossing the line and earning his golden ticket. #seeyouinsquaw. eric senseman… is excited to earn his golden ticket into western states. photo: irunfar/bryon powell local up-and-comerdrew macomberhad a breakout race in rounding out the top-five men. local runner drew macomber found success at lake sonoma. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. ryan ghelfi has some company crossing the finish line. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thoughkeely henninger(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said after the race that she didn’t intend to run off the front from the start, that’s how it worked out. what she called her comfortable, moderate pace quickly led her to the front of the women’s race. from start to finish, keely ran in no-other-woman’s land, only sharing the trail with those in the men’s race. as early as mile 12, she timed in at about two minutes under course-record pace, where she’d basically remain each time we saw her until after mile 38. the heat and sun at midday chewed most people up, and keely said she felt it and eased off the gas when the sun went full tilt. though keely was offered a golden ticket entry into western states, she declined it to instead race the lavaredo ultra trail in june in italy. keely henninger winning the 2018 lake sonoma 50. photo: irunfar/bryon powell taylor nowlin(post-race interview), who fits smack dab in the up-and-comer category, ran herself into second place quite early in the race, a position, like keely in first, she’d hold all the way until the finish. taylor said after the race that the first 30 or so miles came easy for her, but that her nutrition suffered in the final miles and she struggled to maintain a good effort."
"she also said that she felt some pressure when she caught sight of third-place camelia mayfield on the short out and back at the final aid station, at mile 45.5. she must have had plenty of gas in the tank, though, holding her own to the finish. after the race, taylor said she was undecided on whether she’d accept her golden ticket, as she’s also considering the lavaredo ultra trail in italy. onsundaytuesday after the race, the western states race organization said that tayloraccepteddeclined her golden ticket. taylor nowlin climbing her way to second. photo: irunfar/bryon powell camelia mayfield(post-race interview) earned a golden ticket, too, on account of her third-place finish here. another up-and-comer, camelia checked into the mile 12 aid station in fourth place, but found her way into her ultimate finishing position before the race’s halfway point. as others slowed late race, camelia crept up to second-place taylor nowlin around mile 45.5, coming within about one minute of her. both maintained pace from there, however, going two-three across the finish line a minute apart. camelia, we’ll #seeyouinsquaw, too. camelia mayfield in third at mile 30. photo: irunfar/bryon powell ahead of the race,gina slaby(pre-race interview) said she’d aim to start steady and hopefully move up in the race’s second half, and that’s exactly what she did. in sixth at the race’s halfway point, she moved up to fourth place by the race’s end. gina would earn the second women’s golden ticket. gina slaby getting it done at mile 30. photo: irunfar/bryon powell rounding out the women’s top five wasamy leedham. amy leedham joking her way through a rough patch at mile 30. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. meghan laws and amy sproston earned some awards at this year’s lake sonoma. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thank you to jon murchison and mark nassi for their help with our live coverage. we couldn’t have done it without you! related articles:"

"photo: irunfar/meghan hicks there was no usual celebration at the finish, as the two runners, it seemed, were already aware of what was happening. much was lost in translation to me here, as the runners were speaking in chinese and a lot of what they said wasn’t translated into english. eventually they disappeared, and the media was informed that after the runners had time to recover, the race organization would speak with liang. about 75 minutes later, news was circulated around the finish line that liang’s disqualification was now official. the race made a statement on their website a few minutes later that said: “runner liang jing (bib #34) crossed the finish line in 9:28:35 and in first position, but has been disqualified for receiving support outside the checkpoints, which is not permitted by the race rules. liang jing explained that he asked for water from a hiker and understood that he had permission to swap his empty bottle with her full one, as he pushed himself to the limits. he expressed regret at this misunderstanding, apologised for his behaviour, and stated that there would never be a repeat.” to be clear, the race’s rules state that support outside of aid stations isn’t permitted except in cases of emergency or if a runner purchases supplies from a hawker, restaurant, vending machine, or the like on the course. the rules also state that penalties and disqualifications may be applied at the organization’s discretion and are final. this made min qi the race champion. his finish time of 9:28:36 brokefrançois d’haene’s2016 course record of 9:32:26. [editor’ note:we spoke with race director steve brammaron mondayand he confirmed some facts. he indicated that at the 36k point of the race, a hiker lodged a complaint with the race’s other rd janet ng, saying that the runner wearing bib #34 ran up to her and asked for water, took a water bottle from her without permission, and then left a bottle behind. after consideration, the rds decided to allow the runner to finish, hear his side of the story, and, then, make a decision. the rds also warned jing liang a short distance from the finish that they were addressing this incident. after liang’s arrival and after some recovery time, the rds spoke with liang and he recalled the story similarly except that he thought the hiker was offering him water and that there must have been a miscommunication. liang was ultimately disqualified because he confirmed that he took aid outside of support points in a way disallowed by the rules. the rds indicated that liang clearly felt badly for what had happened and said that he wouldn’t do it again.] that’s the end of my objective reporting on this incident, and here are a few words of authorial subjectivity, which i offer in light of this incident and several recent confirmed cheating reports in trail running and ultrarunning. sports are essentially a game, and games have rules."
"in our sport of trail ultrarunning, the rules vary from race to race, but are put in place to attempt to level the game to a match of mind and body. it’s the responsibility of every ‘player’ to know the rules before they start the game, and to abide by them from start to finish. i applaud the race organization for its decision to act on an incident which not only was incongruent with the rules, but gave liang an advantage over the rest of the runners. tough action and reaction in circumstances like this aren’t easy, but upholding a high ethic so as to maintain the values of our sport is crucial. i hope all the sport’s participants choose this path going forward, as well. let’s talk about the rest of the race. the usa’salex nichols(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was somewhere around 20th place at 12k into the race–not a disconcerting number of men in such a competitive race as alex usually let’s the gunners fire things out. the disconcerting number, however, was that he was seven minutes back of the lead already. he would say after the race that he thought he was already running pretty fast at this point, and indeed he was. twentieth place was just temporary, however, as another 10k later he was already in 10th. it went on like this, alex picking off fast starters and those runners who excel less in technical terrain, until a little over 80k into the race where he’d moved into third place. alex would also say after the race that, though he suffered a lull in the middle of the race, he was able to recover it and close strong. he crossed the finish as the third runner home, but was shortly upgraded to second place. american alex nichols looking happy with second place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks china’syun-hui yuwas fun to watch race. he whooped and hollered with joy several times when we saw him, quite obviously enjoying himself. yun-hui went out hard, running with or near to the lead pack for the first 20k or so. after that, he’d lapse back, playing chase for the rest of the race. last year, he finished 13th in 10:53, and this year his effort of running some 49 minutes faster earned him the third spot on the podium. yun-hui yu, of china, hooting with joy. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks the best way to describe the performance of nepal’spurna tamangis to say that he stuck it. he started out the race running in sixth place some 12k in, and finished in fourth place when it was all over. though a few men came and went, moving ahead or lapsing behind him, he stayed steady–and smiling–all day. a member of the winning men’s oxfam trailwalker hong kong team for the last two years, he’s now found solo success on hong kong’s trails with fourth place here."
"bothharry jones, from wales but living in thailand, andjohn ellis, an australian who lives in hong kong, paced themselves expertly, running strong from start to finish and picking off carnage along the way. ellis is a finisher of each of the race’s eight editions, but this is his fastest. with his 10:35 finish, he improves his hk100 pr by some 55 minutes. jones and ellis went fifth and sixth. nepal’ssuman kulungtook seventh place in a strong start-to-finish effort. hong kong’sho-chung wongran across the finish line as applause and cheers roared through the crowd, he a clear hometown favorite.brian mcflynn, an irish runner living in hong kong, moved up in the second half of the race to finish ninth.justin andrews, an american living in china, also ran smart to take 10th. full results. thank you so much to andre blumberg, paper pongsubkarun, and koichi iwasa for their assistance in covering the race!

"congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2018hardrock hundred endurance run! this article breaks down the results of today’s lottery for the run’s 2018 edition. let’s start with some statistics and background information. this year’s lottery entrants list was up to 2,236 applicants. for perspective, the 2017 lottery had 1,966 entrants, the 2016 lottery 1,549 entrants, and the 2015 lottery 1,367 applicants. these 2,236 entrants were represented by 12,357 total tickets, which went into today’s lottery buckets. for perspective, last year’s total ticket pool was 8,490 tickets. prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants into one of three divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. the divisions are veterans, runners who’ve finished hardrock five or more times; nevers, who are runners who’ve never finished hardrock; and everyone else (or, more simply, “else” below), runners who’ve started the event and finished between one and four times. for the 2018 lottery, there were 43 veteran applicants who had 422 tickets, 1,975 never applicants with 11,127 tickets, and 218 else applicants with 808 tickets. looking back at last year’s lottery, there were 43 veteran applicants who had 404 tickets, 1,722 never applicants with 7,339 tickets, and 201 else applicants with 747 tickets. the 2018 event will start 145 runners. today, the event organization selected 33 veterans, 45 nevers, and 67 elses. of the 145 entrants chosen, up to five were chosen ahead of time by the race by run directordale garland, which were announced publicly among the names chosen in the lottery. in addition to entrants drawn in the lottery, waitlist names were also drawn into three separate division-specific waitlists. for perspective, in 2017, 10 people got off the veteran waitlist and into the race (which was everyone on the veteran waitlist),9 people from the never waitlist, and 6 people from the else waitlist. for the 2016 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrant spots 4 deep in the veteran division, 4 deep in the never division, and 7 deep in the else division. for the 2015 edition, the waitlist went to 9 deep for the veterans (which included all of the veterans on the waitlist that year), 9 deep for never, and 12 deep for else. even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end continues to grow in competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which hardrock prides itself upon. below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2018 contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in."

"an emblematic fall day–with bright sunshine yet cool air and a light breeze–greeted runners at the 2017the north face endurance challenge 50 mile championshipsin the san francisco bay area of california. for this year, the course was reformatted, and though it contained many of the same trails and aid stations throughout the southern marin headlands, a new starting line in marin city and a new finish line at crissy field in san francisco over the golden gate bridge meant an overall new feel. after sharing the lead with other men in the race’s first half,tim freriks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) used the second half to break free from the rest of the competition and run unimpeded to a big win. while it may have been another woman who set the early pace in the women’s race,ida nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) marked her with no issue before assuming the lead in the race’s second half. though her challengers were just a minute or a few back at times, ida was stronger than them all and emerged as champion for a second year in a row. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. be sure to check back. a special thanks tothe north facefor making our coverage of this race possible! thanks, too, tojaybirdandgu energy labsfor supporting our coverage of tnf 50. to get all the latest trail and ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. left to right, it’s zach miller, moises jimenez, clare gallagher, and paddy o’leary at the finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thanks for following our week-plus of tnf 50 coverage! if you enjoyed our work, please consider making a donation to support us. with your help, we’re looking forward to a great 2018. thank you! -bryon powell, editor-in-chief of irunfar when the race fired off from its 5 a.m. start in marin city and we all peered up the paved, immediately steep road,zach miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) led everyone out at a pace others would later describe as cross-country race pace. true zach form. by the top of that first climb at 2.5 miles in, zach had settled back into the lead group. from there until stinson beach, mile 28–and though there were other interlopers who came and went from in, around, and even in front of the group at times–a lead trio oftim freriks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), zach, andhayden hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ran within earshot and eyesight of each other. after the race, hayden said that while zach descended the fastest, he and tim climbed a bit better than zach, and, thus, their accordion played on. tim freriks is a happy man at the finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell for more than the race’s first half,matt daniels, a fast runner at shorter distances on the track, road, and trail debuting at 50 miles, ran in the front half of the men’s top 10, eventually settling into fourth place by mile 18. incredibly, a tight pack holding the rest of the men’s top 10 ran together for almost 30 miles."

"ahead of the race, pro road runnerrenee metivier(pre-race interview) said that, though it would be a good idea to start slow in not only her first 50 miler but also her first ultramarathon, she’d probably still go out fast. indeed, she did. the first four times we saw the women, from mile 2.5 through mile 27 at stinson beach, renee was pacesetting andida nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) marked her. after the race, ida explained that renee started really fast but that she likes going fast, too, so she keyed off renee’s pace for quite a long distance. turns out, that long distance was past the race’s halfway point. through mile 27, they were still almost shoulder to shoulder. after that, ida said she felt strong on the climb from stinson beach and that she really likes the wooded section in the headlands above there, so she moved well. renee metivier (left) leading ida nilsson at stinson beach (mile 27). photo: irunfar/bryon powell out of the forest and back down to muir beach at mile 39, ida led with renee nowhere in sight. there, ida would be faced with a new pressure, though, that ofclare gallagher(post-race interview) just one-and-a-half minutes off the lead. clare, who’d been running in the third to fifth-ish positions for the first half of the race, was making herself known in running for the win now. but ida was the stronger woman on the day because a couple miles later, when they passed through tennessee valley for the second time at mile 42, she’d increased her lead to just under four minutes. from there, the pair ran almost the same speed to the finish line, where ida would cross as champion for the second year in a row, and where clare would take second, improving upon her fifth last year. clare gallagher being herself at mile 28. photo: irunfar/bryon powell third-placemegan kimmel(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said after the race that, at 10 or 12 miles in, she wasn’t sure if she would finish. her calf muscles have long been her tnf 50 nemesis, and she said she was feeling them early. turns out, her calf muscles hung in there just fine and so did her strategy–what she described after the race as her budding “ultra strategy”–of starting easier so that she could run strong later. i did think it was a little unusual where, in the first half of the race, megan was running several minutes and positions back from the lead, but it all made sense when, starting a mile 39, megan had moved up into third place, a position she’d maintain to the finish. megan kimmel after another solid run at the tnf 50. photo: irunfar/bryon powell local runnermegan rochehad a helluva’ debut at the 50-mile distance with her fourth-place finish. early on, she seemed patient and calm, hovering at or just outside the top five. later in the race, she moved up to fourth place and looked incredibly focused upon keeping that spot."

"on a relatively cool sunday with occasional rain showers and partly cloudy skies in the grands causses of southern france, new zealand’sruth croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and france’ssébastien spehler(post-race interview)ran fast and strategic races to emerge as champions among competitive women’s and men’s fields at the 2017grand trail des templiers. les templiers is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) race boasting 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) of climb with a goodly amount of it on more technical and steep singletrack in the race’s second half, following a more runnable first half. in addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews onour les templiers live-coverage page. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. france’s grands causses, the home of les templiers. photo: irunfar/bryon powell please consider making a donation in support of our coverage of les templiers. thank you! -bryon powell, editor-in-chief of irunfar the usa’scamille herronseems to know one speed, and that’s fast. it was, thus, no surprise that she led the women’s race at 9 kilometers.ida nilsson(pre-race interview) andemelie forsberg(pre-race interview), swedes who live in norway, were strung out two-three behind camille, both trailing less than 30 seconds back. at 26k, the next point in which we saw the field, ida had moved up front with emelie still a half minute off the lead, now in second. new zealand’sruth croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and sweden’smimmi kotka–yes, another swede!–were making statements now, running together in third place. here, too, we had our first glimpse of canada’sanne-marie maddenwho was right in the mix, running in fifth. five women, a third of the way through the race, all within a minute: yep, things were shaping up. emelie forsberg running before dawn at the 2017 les templiers. photo: irunfar/bryon powell between there and the 35k point, ruth moved up to join ida in the lead. both looked strong as they cruised through the aid station. in third and fourth, within 90 seconds of the lead and a couple seconds of each other, were anne-marie and emelie. it was starting to look like a race of four, as these women were building a gap over the rest of the women’s field. ida nilsson and ruth croft leading together at 35k. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the 48k point was another turning point, as ruth was alone in first with a minute lead on second-place ida. five more minutes until we’d see another woman, this pair was also gapping the rest of the women’s field. it seemed clear that, barring something strange, the race for the win was now a race of two. at 65.5k, amidst the technical and at times steep singletrack that characterize parts of the race’s second half, ruth recorded a nearly 11-minute lead on her closest chaser, but trouble brewed. she thought she’d get her personal nutrition at this water-only aid station, but crewing wasn’t permitted. resultingly, she’d suffer and slow in the final 10k–a challenging 10k at that."
"second-place ida was still moving well and moving up on ruth fast, decreasing ruth’s 11-minute lead to 4.5 minutes at the finish line. not enough real estate for ida to catch up and plenty enough for ruth to retain her lead, the duo put to rest their duel and went one-two in this dynamic women’s race. ruth croft, 2017 les templiers champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell as for anne-marie and emelie, emelie moved ahead of anne-marie before the 48k point, and then gently created a gap to finish third, with anne-marie in fourth. mimmi held tough for a fifth-place finish. camille would not finish the race, dropping at 48k. reigning iau trail world champion, france’sadeline roche, was an early drop–she entered the race with a bit of injury, gave it a shot, and ducked out after the first checkpoint. anne-marie madden looking pleased with her fourth-place finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. nine kilometers into the men’s race of any competitive trail ultramarathon in europe is like being 9k into a road marathon. the pace is hot and everyone is there. les templiers 2017 would be no different. sweden’sandré jonssonled the massive pack of dudes. no joke, when we checked the numbers after the race, it was 30 men within two minutes of the lead. at the second aid station, 26k, the men had given each other some breathing room. here, nine men ran within two minutes of the lead. this time, finland’shenri ansioled the charge with andré, france’ssébastien spehler(post-race interview), switzerland’smarc lauenstein, and france’snico martin(pre-race interview) in hot pursuit. some expected top runners, like sweden’selov olsson, the usa’salex nichols(pre-race interview), and norway’sstian angermund-vik(pre-race interview) occupied positions in the 20th- to 30th-place range, but they all looked okay. when we saw the men next, a leader had emerged. sébastien led the charge at 35k, which is approaching the halfway point distance-wise but not even close to the midpoint in time–there’s a lot of racing left still–with no other man in sight. after a full minute, it was a rush of france countrymates nico,sylvain court, andromain maillardtogether in second through fourth. nicolas martin (right), sylvain court (left), and romain maillard (obscured) at 35k. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the rest of the top-10 men came through before the five-minute mark, and this group included marc in fifth, andré and henri working together in sixth and seventh, morocco’srachid el morabityin eighth, france’sadrien michaudin ninth, and spain’sjessed hernandezin 10th. we next saw the men at 48k, and it was clear that sébastien was seriously making a go of it, now with a four-minute lead. trailing him was nico, looking well, too. romain and marc ran in third and fourth. surprise, surprise, who was now amongst the top-10 men? grab your popcorn, after being in 18th place at 35k, alex had moved up to ninth and was 11.5 minutes back. he looked well enough that we expected him to keep doing what alex does best, running the second half of races faster than most of his peers. the only question was, how far could he move up?"
"alex nichols at 48k and on his way to third place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at 65.5k, with just a little over 10k to go, the game seemed almost over because sébastien looked really strong and his gap over second place was now 6.5 minutes. the beauty of ultrarunning, though, is that anything can and does happen, so it’s only over when it’s over. in second was nico, still there, still strong, and holding his own 6.5-minute lead over third place. in the end, the frenchmen would cross the line one-two, with sébastien the men’s champion. sébastien spehler, 2017 les templiers champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell back at 65.5k, marc had moved up to third. but alex was now in fourth, a minute out of podium position, and on the definitive hunt. while we waited at the finish, word from the final aid station at 69k was that marc was holding onto third but barely, with alex a couple seconds back. from there to the finish, alex hammered home to third place and marc arrived in fourth. fun fact, alex was just under 11 minutes back at the finish, about the same deficit he had to winner sébastien some 28k prior. with a mix of men running close together in the race’s final third, henri came out on top to finish fifth. notable dnfs included both sylvain and rachid who bowed out late in the race after running inside the top 10 for a while. romain maillard (right) and marc lauenstein running toward their respective fourth and seventh places. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. related articles:"
"among world-class fields, americansclare gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andhayden hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) each brought home big wins at the 2017ccc, the 101-kilometer race that’s part of the week-long utmb festival. because of a storm, the race organization made a last-minute ccc course change to the final section between vallorcine and la flégère, which normally travels via a high and appropriately named pass called tête aux vents, to take a lower and unexposed path. this course change is thought to have sped the race up by a bit. on friday morning, september 1, the ccc shot off from downtown courmayeur, italy, to make its half loop around mont blanc to the chamonix, france finish line. blue skies and clouds greeted runners through the italian part of the race, while rain and, eventually for the mid- and back-of-the-packers, snowy mix closed in on the course on the french side. in the end 1,742 entrants made it to the finish, while 414 people did not. in addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews onour ccc live-coverage page. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. we covered the ccc in-depth and on-location without any brand support, because we thought the race was competitive and deserved to have its story told. as we still have to pay our bills and keep the lights on here at irunfar, please consider making a donation in support of our work. thank you! -bryon powell, editor-in-chief of irunfar spain’smaite maiorashot off the ccc start line and took out the first, super-steep climb hard. the usa’sclare gallagher(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) played chase, saying after the race that maite’s exceptional pace couldn’t–or perhaps shouldn’t–be matched so early on. through about the race’s halfway point, maite led and clare stalked in the vicinity of two to four minutes back in second place. clare gallagher, 2017 ccc champion. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein by the time the pair reached champex-lac, switzerland, after halfway, clare had overtaken the lead and it was maite’s turn to lurk closely behind. though maite had given up the lead spot, she wasn’t going to go down easily. at vallorcine, 83k, just before the final climb and descent, clare held only a three-minute lead. clare must have absolutely hammered that last climb, though, because at the top of it, at la flégère, she now had a 13-minute lead. clare maintained that lead through the finish line to become the 2017 ccc champion, with maite as the runner-up. maite maiora finishing second at ccc 2017. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein spain’slaia caneshad a strong race, occupying third position for most of it, but the usa’skeely henningerkept the pressure on all the way to the finish, running just a couple minutes behind laia for much of the race. in the end, just four minutes separated the pair as they went third and fourth. laia canes taking third at ccc 2017. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein three americans in the top five, holy smokes!"

"after taking second twice, spain’snúria picasnailed it this time for the women’s win. in the men’s race, it was now-three-time champion, france’sfrançois d’haene,who emerged at the front of the huge field of top male competitors. in doing so, both became 2017utmbchampions. the entire field of runners encountered difficult weather conditions at times with rain, snow, and wind. a volatile weather forecast led the utmb race organization to make two last-minute modifications to the normal course. they removed the technical and steep up-then-down pyramids calcaires in italy, which was a new addition to the course in 2016, as well as the normal route between vallorcine and la flégère near the end of the race, which normally travels via a high and appropriately named pass called tête aux vents, to take a lower and unexposed path. the resulting 2017 modified route was a couple kilometers shorter–quoted at 166.9 kilometers by the race organization–and with a bit less climb and descent. on friday evening, september 1, the race fired off west from its chamonix, france starting line to travel a counterclockwise loop around mont blanc while traveling through france, italy, switzerland, and back to the same square in downtown chamonix. the race saw 1,685 finishers and 852 dnfs. in addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews onour utmb live-coverage page. and check outour photo galleryfrom the awesome kirsten kortebein! as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to utmb-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back. a special thanks tocamelbakfor making our coverage of utmb possible! thanks also togu energyandaltrafor their support of our utmb coverage. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. it is decided: france’sfrançois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)is the king of long mountain ultramarathons. if any of us wasn’t sure of said statement ahead of this race, surely we all were convinced as we watched françois become champion of this best-ever-assembled group of men in a trail ultramarathon. and let’s be real here, he didn’t just win, he dominated. from start to finish, it was françois who was right there, either setting the pace or matching whomever else was doing so. françois d’haene looking confident and relaxed before the start. photo: irunfar/bryon powell françois shared the race’s first marathon with several different men–but all of the expected ones–includingkilian jornet(post-race interview),jim walmsley(post-race interview), andxavier thévenard(pre-race interview). eventually, xavier lost contact off the back of this group while climbing to col du bonhomme at a little over 40k into the race and just after dark on friday night. from there, it was the remaining trio who ran closely together to the 90k mark at refuge bonatti, which lies high on a ridge above val ferret in italy. this trio traveled accordion-style, spreading out by a minute or so at times, depending on the terrain and time spent in aid stations. however, at 90k, kilian began to lag behind, arriving there four minutes behind françois."
"and by another 20k after that, in the village of la fouly, switzerland at dawn on saturday morning, jim, too, said good-bye to the lead. while jim arrived to la fouly close to françois, he was tired and needed recuperative time before hitting the trail again. jim walmsey, xavier thévenard, and kilian jornet together in the les contamines aid station. photo: irunfar/bryon powell for the race’s final 55 kilometers, françois slowly but surely created space between him and the rest of the men’s field. and, i need to say, his efforts brought what felt like the entire euro trail community out onto the race course to cheer for him–in an energetic but also, at times, too-frenetic way. case in point, they created a 30-minute, dead-stop traffic jam in vallorcine, which is 149k into the race, when about five of them simply left their cars in the driving lanes to watch françois run by on the trail next to the road. no joke. back in chamonix, on the 1.5k glory run through town to the finish line, françois ran through a sea of humans filling the route, wanting a glimpse of him or a slap of his hand. a huge smile upon his face, his arms lifting now and then to clap and fist pump, françois swam that sea and crossed the line as 2017 utmb champion. françois d’haene runs into la fouly at dawn on saturday morning. photo: irunfar/bryon powell since 2009, i’ve been watching spain’s kilian jornet run and race. since 2009, i’ve watched him find relative ease in racing trail ultramarathons and dominating men’s fields within them. and, since 2009, it’s been exactly twice that i’ve seen kilian worked over by these types of races, the first when the heat got the best of him at the 2010western states 100and the second this weekend when the fast pace slowly but surely wore him down. kilian would say after the race that he loved the first half of the race and suffered the second, but if there’s anyone who can suffer better than kilian, i would like to meet him or her. kilian jornet running into saint-gervais. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks the first glimpse we had that françois might be the better racer on the day between he and kilian was at the 64k mark above lac combal when we watched françois slow to wait for kilian after a downhill section. but it was another 26k later at refuge bonatti where the fatigue of the day had accumulated enough and kilian arrived some four minutes after françois. at pretty much each checkpoint after that, kilian dropped back a little more. however, in total fairness, he looked happy, was running well, and still looked like the kilian we’ve grown to expect. that is, until the final checkpoint at la flégère, about 7k from the finish. kilian was well and truly whooped there!"
"in the end, kilian is still kilian, a downhill running legend, and we watched him hammer some of that last long downhill back into chamonix to take second, 15 minutes off the lead. kilian is an enormous fan favorite, and fans filling the finish line roared as he ran the final straightway and across the line. it’s two for two for americantim tollefson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)! tim proved that his 2016 third-place finish was definitely no fluke by doing it all again. at the first spot irunfar’s reporters were stationed, above the village of saint-gervais a little past 20k into the race at sunset friday night, tim looked calm around 15th place. another 20k later at col du bonhomme, in the snow, wind, and below-freezing temperatures offered there, he’d cracked top 10 and was looking unbothered by the weather. another 25k after that, at above lac combal in italy, and he’d moved up to seventh position and looked like his race was just starting. to paraphrase jim walmsley after the race, tim hit the italy-switzerland border at 100k and flew. moving into third place at champex-lac, switzerland, 123k, he would run unchallenged by anyone behind him to the finish line. the dude knows how to celebrate at the utmb finish. huge smile, high fiving the crowds, high-knees running up and down the chute–his party, his way. tim tollefson striding into la fouly. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein france’s xavier thévenard (pre-race interview)knows how to execute. ahead of the race, he said that his goal was to run 21 hours, no matter what the men’s field was doing around him. last-minute, weather-induced course changes shortened the route by an estimated hour’s worth of running for the lead men and, what do we have here, but a 20-hour finish for xavier? he ran the first 35k or so in contact with the lead runners, but let them go on the long climb to col du bonhomme, the race’s marathon mark on a high pass in france, to do his own thing. several times going into different checkpoints, we saw xavier checking his watch and checking in on his race plan. at the finish line, he said that the weather conditions were hard at times, as his hands got so cold that it was hard to eat. that said, i think his finish time matched his goal, and he sat at the finish with what looked like a content, yet fatigued smile in fourth place. the usa’s jim walmsley and his 100-mile racing is just so entertaining. the dude is inordinately talented, fit, and driven. but what he and his 100-mile racing is so far confirming is that 100 miles on mountainous trails requires a significant mental component–it’s not just physicality anymore. if jim can figure out the psychology and strategy of racing 100 mountain miles, watch out world. that said, jim’s fifth place should not be discounted: the only guys to beat him collectively have eight utmb wins, a second, two thirds, and a fourth–and nothing else in their combined 12 runs at utmb."
"for about 100k, jim ran at or near the front of the race, with françois and kilian. it was clearly a struggle for him to stay with these guys at times, though, to run the pace of two very experienced mountain ultramarathoners and not run ahead. at 110k in la fouly, switzerland, jim arrived close to the lead, but tired, underfed, and with blistered feet. he took significant breaks in la fouly and another 13k later in champex-lac to address his various issues. these breaks and a general slowdown lapsed him back to seventh position. his energy and competitive drive eventually returned, though, and he clawed back a couple positions to finish fifth. after the race, jim said he’d learned a lot and was already eager to race utmb again. jim walmsley walking his way out of la fouly before going on to finish fifth. photo: irunfar/kirsten kortebein spain’spau capellhad a great race, backing up loads of stellar results in 2016 and early 2017 with a sixth-place finish here. he created some fun finish-line drama by hunting jim just 100 meters back or so and forcing jim into run sub-six-minute-mile pace through the streets of chamonix to hold onto fifth place. the usa’sdylan bowmannailed it for seventh place in his first utmb finish. in speaking with him after the race, it’s clear he’ll go home happy but hungry for more. lithuania’sgediminas grinius(pre-race interview), who finished second last year, battled an old injury to eighth place this year.zach millerdid not have his best day but he still managed to runinto the top 10 with ninth place, helping put four americans in the top 10, more than any other country. tenth place, spain’sjordi gamito, might just have been one of the happiest guys in the field. he seemingly wore a smile all day, night, and day. jordi gamito running into la fouly. photo: irunfar/bryon powell last year’s fourth place, americandavid laney(pre-race interview) ultimately took 14th. pre-race favoritesjason schlarbandsage canaday, both americans, had off-par days but each made it to the finish in the 26-hour range. some notable withdrawals,tòfol canstanyerandmiguel heras, both of spain, good friends, and who spent much of the race running together just outside the men’s top 10, would both dnf, with miguel making it as far as trient, switzerland, just 25k from the finish line, before stopping. that all said, i think the drop rate among the highest-echelon men was overall quite low. full results. the top-six men at utmb 2017 (left-to-right): 5. jim walmsley, 2. kilian jornet, 1. françois d’haene, 3. tim tollefson, 4. xavier thévenard, 6. pau capell. photo: irunfar/bryon powell it’s true, the reign of spain’snúria picas(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) has returned. new fans of trail ultrarunning might not know her name as she’s been on a physical and mental break from international racing for the last year and a half or so, but in her heyday of 2013 to 2015, she was close to unbeatable. and, now, she’s back. núria set the pace of the women’s race pretty much all night, all day, and into the night again."
"for some 130 kilometers, she looked like the núria we know: calm and quiet in outward psychology, lightfooted and efficient in physical state, and damn fast. with the exception of the first 20 kilometers where she shared the trail with several different women, no one amongst this year’s competition could ultimately keep her pace. in the race’s final 30 or so kilometers, núria suffered some breathing problems which made running almost impossible. she was thusly forced to walk much of the final downhill into chamonix and the roads through town. when she crossed the line and became the 2017 utmb champion, her face was a mix of emotion: happy, shocked, and, well, tired, too. in speaking with her after the race, it’s clear that núria’s competitive fire has returned. núria picas winning utmb 2017. photo: irunfar/bryon powell switzerland’sandrea huser(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) is really something else. at just over 20k into the race, above the village of saint-gervais at about dark on friday night, andrea told us, “i’m tired.” and she didn’t look her springy self either. she was running in the women’s top 10 there, but it looked like it was taking significant effort to do so. but, little by little, as the night went on, andrea said after the race that she began to feel better. her position relative to the rest of the women reflected this, too. in the earliest hours of saturday morning, as the distance and bad weather began taking its toll on the field, andrea kept moving up. by 90k, she was in third place and in second just 10k later. andrea’s competitive story wasn’t over there, though. because andrea was moving well and núria was walking much of the final seven kilometers, andrea crept very close to the winning position. in the end, less than three minutes separated them, an incredibly small spread after 166 kilometers of racing. andrea huser just enjoying some watermelon in la fouly. photo: irunfar/bryon powell france’schristelle bard(post-race interview) had a huge breakout race to round out the women’s podium. her performance wasn’t unprecedented, though, as she’s had two strong finishes at the utmb festival of events in taking third at last year’s tds and fourth in the 2015 ccc. christelle started the race conservatively, saying after the race that the race’s fast starting pace put her pretty far back in the field. by about the race’s halfway point, however, she’d moved inside the top 10. at 90k in, at refuge bonatti high on a ridgeline in italy, christelle was seventh. just 10k later at grand col ferret, the pass where runners leave italy and drop down into switzerland, she’d moved up to fourth. and by champex-lac a little over 20k after that, she was in podium position, where she would finish. it was a smooth and even-keel effort that got the job done for christelle. christelle bard finishing third at utmb 2017. photo: irunfar/bryon powell holy smokes, how about japan’skaori niwa? as objective as i try to be with my reporting, there’s everything to just love about this woman. she’s got a perma-smile."
"there’s no hype or pomp to accompany her running. she simply runs and smiles and kicks the pants off competitive women’s fields like this one with her steady, speedy, relentless progress. eighth place at last year’s utmb and fourth at this years, what is kaori’s potential here? by the way, kaori also finished fourth at utmb wearing a cast and nursing a broken arm from a fall at the tromsø skyrace a month ago. ahem, extra toughness points there. kaori niwa explaining to kilian jornet that she broke her arm at the tromsø skyrace… ahead of taking fourth at utmb 2017. photo: irunfar/bryon powell australia’skellie emmersontook fifth place, after running in sixth as late as a couple kilometers away from the finish line. she made a latest-of-race kicks to propel herself into that final fifth spot. after a couple rough gos at big races so far this year, canada’salissa st laurent(post-race interview) was due a good race, and i think she got it in finishing sixth. great britain’sanna-marie watsontook seventh.amy sprostonwas the usa’s top finisher. she rallied in the race’s second half after fighting a bad stomach from the starting line to finish eighth. bulgaria’smaria nikolovawas ninth, and australia’srobyn bruinswas 10th. major hat tip to the aussie ladies, as they put more women in the top 10 than any other country. kellie emmerson running into les contamines. photo: irunfar/bryon powell last year’s utmb champion, france’scaroline chaverot(pre-race interview), ran in second position as late as 90 kilometers. you know, caroline always looks like she’s working hard–we’ve heard her breathing like it’s 10k race some 100 kilometers into these sorts of races. so when we saw her putting a lot of effort into things, we thought it was standard procedure for her. turns out, caroline wasn’t feeling well and it got the best of her after the 90k aid station at refuge bonatti in italy. at the next aid station, arnouvaz, she dropped from the race, citing physical problems. caroline’s raced a lot this year, including very recently thehardrock 100. it seems maybe like some recovery is in order for her. caroline chaverot while running the top three into les contamines. photo: irunfar/bryon powell several other top women also didn’t make it to the finish line. france’sjuliette blanchet, last year’s fourth-place woman, stopped at lac combal, 65k. after running among the top women early,emelie lecomte, of france, dropped in courmayeur, italy, making it two utmb dnfs in a row for her. and brazil’sfernanda maciel(pre-race interview) dnfed at arnouvaz, 95k. to end this on a happy note, while there are hundreds of lovely mid- and back-of-the-pack stories, one we love is the utmb march that the usa’samanda basham,magda boulet, andkaci lickteigmade with each other. while kaci hadn’t planned to ‘race’ race utmb due to a lack of training while caring for an ill family member this summer, amanda and magda tried and it wasn’t either of their days. this trio teamed up, worked together, and crossed the line hand in hand."

"the 2017hardrock 100was run in challenging conditions, which included a severe storm for most of the field on the first day, an injurious fall for spaniardkilian jornet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), and a brief interlude of getting lost by france’scaroline chaverot(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). no matter, these two rose from those challenges to win via their own commanding, but very different performances. in the men’s race,mike foote(pre-race interview) took second for the third time, andjoe grantrounded out the podium after a couple recent rough goes at hardrock. in the women’s race,darcy piceu(pre-race interview) landed her fourth second place and her seventh finish in first or second here, and france’snathalie mauclair(pre-race interview) overcame the challenges of living at sea level to round out the women’s podium and finish her first hardrock. in the end, 126 runners among the 145 starters completed the tough mountain circuit made up of more than 33,000 feet of climbing starting and ending in silverton, colorado. the final few runners reached the finish line during the last hour of the race–between 5 and 6 a.m. sunday morning–before the 48-hour cutoff. the final 2017 run finisher wasrobert andrulis, who in crossing the line completed his 10th hardrock. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back. a special thanks tosmartwoolfor making our coverage of the hardrock 100 possible! thanks also toaltrafor their support of our hardrock coverage. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. the view from dives-little giant pass, the top of the first climb during the 2017 hardrock 100. photo: irunfar/mike place if there is such a thing as hardrock lovingkilian jornet(pre-race interview), then there might also be such a thing as jornet loving hardrock. the now-four-time champ, who is arguably the world’s best mountain athlete, could undertake pretty much any race or expedition he wants, anywhere in the world, anytime, and yet he returned for his fourth outing around the 100.5-mile silverton-and-back-to-silverton loop through the remote san juan mountains of colorado. that’s gotta’ say something about an event. like in previous years, jornet went out with whatever runners set the pace. in this case, it wascaroline chaverotat the very start andiker karrera(pre-race interview) soon after. jornet and karrera would work together and run near to each other until ouray, at mile 57. kilian jornet descending into grouse gulch, mile 42, with his injured arm tucked inside his jacket. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks around mile 14, as jornet dropped through a steep snow patch off buffalo boy ridge and into maggie gulch, he took a head-over-heels–actually a couple times, as he recalled post-race–tumble. in an interview with us after the race, he said he was looking around instead of at where he was putting his feet, punched through the snow and into rocks, and rolled. this dislocated his left shoulder and opened a couple small flesh wounds."
"jornet explained that he has a problem with dislocating that shoulder after several previous similar injuries in skiing and climbing, and he also said that he then used his other arm to re-locate his humorous bone where it should be inside his shoulder joint. yep, on the mountain, with some 85 miles yet to run. his pain eventually began to bother him, especially on downhills due to the jostling and bouncing involved in downhill running. at grouse gulch, mile 42, he asked for it to be taped immobile against this body, the way he’d then carry his arm for 58 more miles. a significant shoulder injury was still no match for jornet. after sharing the relative lead with several runners until the kt aid station at mile 89, jornet easily accelerated on the long, final climb, gapped everyone else in the field, and finished some 22 minutes ahead of any other man. his 24:32 is his slowest of his four hardrock finishes, perhaps a reflection of how an injured arm slowed him down at least a little bit. early pace setter and lead sharer karrera ran in or near to the lead for the race’s first 57 miles. he looked calm and collected, and especially able on the steep, off-trail, and little-trailed downhills which frequent the course. however, he would become beset by stomach issues that required him to hole up in the town of ouray, mile 57, for almost 90 minutes. eventually, they would abate enough that he would be able to forge ahead, though several positions back and at a slower pace. leaving ouray, he exited as fifth man. he would mostly run in this position until about a mile from the finish where he was overtaken to finish in sixth place. iker karrera in maggie gulch, at mile 15. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks mike foote(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) knows how to run hardrock. patient, even-keeled, and chill-but-focused seems to be his winning psychological recipe in addition to wicked physical fitness. all day long, it seemed, foote ran in contact with the lead. the guy was just always right there. a couple cases in point, at maggie gulch (mile 15), engineer aid station (mile 49), and at ouray (mile 57), he remained just five minutes off the lead. at the mountain town of telluride in the western san juans, mile 73, foote left the aid station in the lead, but withjoe grant(post-race interview) and the always looming jornet right there. from mile 73 to mile 89, foote kept in close contact with eventual winner jornet. though foote was no match for jornet in the final 11 miles, the rest of the field was no match for him and he finished some 43 minutes ahead of everyone else. three times a second-place finisher for foote, in 2009, 2015, and this year. mike foote looking happy in maggie gulch. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks similar to mike foote but a bit more loosely, grant ran in comfortable contact with the lead from the start to very near to the finish."
"let’s take a look at the same aid stations we examined with foote: at maggie gulch (mile 15) he was eight minutes back, at engineer aid station (mile 49) he was 17 minutes back, and at ouray (mile 57) he was full-on sharing the race lead with jornet. after ouray and up until chapman gulch at mile 82, grant remained in very close contact with the lead. he said after the race that he suffered the final climbs especially, though he remained capable on the downhills. he would roll over the finish line in third place. joe grant running at 12,000 feet in maggie gulch. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks wyoming’sgabe joyesis a strong regional runner with solid credentials at tough ultras in the rocky mountain west, though he remained untested among a more competitive stage like this one. very early in the race, joyes placed himself among the top-10 men. for example, at mile 15 in maggie gulch, he was in seventh place. throughout the race, he’d ride the waves of positions in the middle part of the top 10, while generally trending downward in position. his fourth place and sub-27-hour finish seal the deal on his street cred for playing with the big guns of mountain ultrarunning. nick couryplayed the race super smart, moving up from well outside the men’s top 10 in the race’s first third, to sixth position with a mile to go. there, he accelerated past then-fifth-place karrera to finish in the fifth position and for his fourth hardrock finish. notable among the men’s field, co-defending championjason schlarb(pre-race interview) dropped in cunningham gulch, just nine miles into the race, following a couple days of gastrointestinal illness. both coury brothers finished inside the top 10, withjamil couryearning eighth place among the men.scott jaimefinished, earning his 10th hardrock completion in 11 tries at the event.blake woodearned his 21st finish, and kirk apt took home number 23. gabe joyes at telluride, mile 73. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. scott jaime with his family at grouse gulch while on his way to his 10th finish. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks i’ve never seen someone race quite likecaroline chaverot(pre-race interview) does, with such singular focus, at such incredible intensity, and for such a lengthy period of time–in this case, 28.5 hours. she led the women’s race from start to finish. let’s be clear, she took the men’s race out hot, too. a half mile into the race, chaverot full on led the entire field and as far as maggie gulch, mile 15, she ran at men’s—not women’s—course-record pace. by the next time we saw caroline, in the former mining outpost of sherman at mile 29, she’d notably slowed from her previous efforts of keeping nearly with the men’s leaders, but was still running well under women’s record pace. in fact, at sherman, she was 12 minutes up on the women’s course record."
"she increased that time between there and governor’s basin, mile 64.5, what amounted to the race’s middle third, where she was 34 minutes ahead of women’s course-record pace and perhaps most meaningfully, only 23 minutes behind the lead men! let your mind wrap around what it means to have a woman running just 23 minutes back of a guy called kilian jornet some 65 miles into a race. unreal effort on chaverot’s part. caroline chaverot descending into grouse gulch in the rain. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks what happened next was something for the storybooks. first, she had a noticeable slowdown episode climbing the three miles from governor’s basin to kroger’s canteen, arriving to the latter just 19 minutes ahead of record pace and now 29 minutes behind the lead men. by all accounts, the slog up to kroger’s was messy and slow this year due to rotten snow—everyone’s splits recorded slow ascents here—but caroline ascended these three miles slower than the peers with whom she’d shared the trail this day so far. then, about a mile after kroger’s canteen, where the route climbs out of the head of marshall basin and into the head of liberty bell basin via the mendota saddle—a small pass—caroline missed the saddle and descended about 1,200 vertical feet into marshall basin before apparently noticing her mistake and retracing her footsteps back to the saddle and onto the course. all in all, it appears she was off course for a little over an hour, but it also appears that the episode disturbed her psychology for the balance of the race. she was visibly angry at the next aid station of telluride and clearly somewhat disappointed with herself as late as the finish. caroline would close the final third of hardrock strongly. in the 27 miles from telluride back to silverton, she would not approach her previous pace as the men ahead of her increased their gap on her and her pace was now slower than women’s record pace, but she also remained untouchable by the rest of the women’s field. her best competition in the race’s final third was from second-placedarcy piceu(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). in telluride, piceu rolled through 66 minutes off the lead. at the finish, she was 51 minutes back. though piceu cut into chaverot’s lead by 15 minutes in 27 miles, chaverot was too far in front and still moving too well to be caught. as a result of her dominating performance and despite her off-course time, chaverot won the 2017 edition of the race in the third-fastest time in its storied history. darcy piceu on her way to second place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks simultaneous to chaverot’s off-the-front efforts, a strong competition betweenhannah green,anna frost(pre-race interview), piceu, andnathalie mauclair(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) ensued for more than half the race. as late as ouray at mile 57, this foursome was split by only 31 minutes—a miniscule amount of time in a race such as hardrock."
"on the long and enduring 4,000-plus-foot climb out of ouray up to the mile 67.5 high point of kroger’s canteen, green began to struggle and lose contact with the group while piceu moved into the group’s leadership position, breaking off the front of it and gaining a 20-minute lead over the rest of the women. this is a position that piceu would not only hold steady in during the race’s final third, but also increase her place in. that is, when she crossed the finish line back in silverton in second place, her closest chaser was 72 minutes back. of note is that piceu also was among the few hardrock runners to race without a pacer the whole time. with her second-place finish, she brought her lifetime hardrock statistics up to three wins and four second-place finishes. anna frost enjoying the wildflower magic of maggie gulch. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks france’s mauclair says that her race was limited by the altitude, and that she had to move more slowly than she would have liked. early on, such as when we saw mauclair at maggie gulch (mile 15), sherman (mile 29), grouse gulch (mile 42), and ouray (mile 57), she ran in the fifth position, but she was in clear contact with and a part of the pack of second-through-fifth-place women. between ouray and telluride, mile 73, mauclair ticked up a position from fifth to fourth place. then, she arrived into telluride in fourth while then-third-place frost was there, and left in third place. the back-and-forth effort between mauclair and frost continued, with frost overtaking mauclair atop the climb after telluride, oscar’s pass, before mauclair overtook frost and arrived to the mile-82 chapman gulch aid station with a four-minute lead over frost. from there, mauclair would hold and then increase her lead over frost to finish in third place. what she described at the finish line as a long battle which involved perhaps just the right amount of suffering, two-time defending champion frost emerged as this year’s fourth-place finisher. becky batesrounded out the top-five women. green, who early on influenced the women’s race and who eventually took a long rest before continuing on, finished in seventh place. notable among the women’s race,darla askewearned her fifth finish,tina ureher sixth,liz bauerher ninth, andbetsy kalmeyerher 18th! full results. hannah green at mile 9. photo: irunfar/marissa harris photos and video articles race reports [section last updated august 1, 2017] it takes a huge team to bring you the coverage we did! thanks to all our volunteers in the field: eliza hamm, marissa harris, vince heyd, roch horton, charles johnston, ryan koch, sherri philips, mike place, denise and justin ricks, ashley saloga, and kim wrinkle. thanks, as well, to mauri pagliacci for his office support from argentina. our coveritlive discussion would not have been possible without the help of jon allen, ellie greenwood, andy jones-wilkins, travis liles, aaron marks, mauri pagliacci, travis trampe, and dani torres. the second day’s sunrise on grant-swamp pass. photo: irunfar/vince heyd related articles:"
"thelavaredo ultra trail(119 kilometers and 5,850 meters of climb) took place this weekend at cortina d’ampezzo in northern italy. caroline chaverotof france claimed her second victory at lavaredo in a winning time of 14:05 and 12th overall. chaverot now has the two fastest times including the course record of 13:40 that she set in 2015. fabien antolinosof france claimed his first major victory with a stunning win in a fast time of 12:32 and only 17 minutes off the course record. he raced within himself for the first half and used that as a foundation to move strongly through the field to finish for the win. the dolomites. photo: irunfar/ian campbell after a stormy preceding night, the conditions happened to be perfectly cool and dry enough for the 11 p.m. start in the centre of cortina for the 11th edition of the lavaredo ultra trail. as the runners amassed, the music blared out and the atmosphere became euphoric as the seconds ticked by, getting ever closer to the start time. it’s always a fast start at lavaredo and this year was no exception, catalanpau capelland a strong race favorite with his impressive streak of performances was leading it out and working together with new zealand’sscott hawkeras they reached ospitale at the 18-kilometer mark. they had already created a one-minute lead on the chasing pack that included norway’sdidrik hermansenand americanseth swanson. the women’s race had already set its stage, new zealand’sruth croftandcaroline chaverotcame in to the ospitale aid station within seconds of each other. they had already stretched the gap on poland’sewa majerand italianlisa borzanito seven minutes, such was this opening frenetic pace. ruth croft running toward second place at the 2017 lavaredo ultra trail. photo: irunfar/ian campbell the race proceeds through the forested trails with a short climb to son forca and into federavecchia followed by a much bigger climb to refugio auronzo at 48k. still with the lead came a strong capell but now on his own as hawker was having stomach problems and would drop much later. swanson topped out the climb to the refugio looking deadly and in the hunt and ready to close that 10-minute gap. hermansen and lithuaniangediminas griniuswere showing their experience and had moved up to third and fourth. race winner antolinos was clearly in good shape as he arrived less than one minute later and only 17 minutes off the lead. chaverot arrived at the refugio in 5:22 elapsed with croft three minutes later and very much looking to stay in touch and perhaps hustle chaverot out of first place. as it happened for both the women’s and men’s races, the strategic advantage was to significantly change at around 67k at cimabanche. after the tough climb to auronzo, there is a long downhill stretch and a relatively flat section in and out of cimabanche followed by a much shorter climb and a lovely descent to 75k and malga ra stua. it was at cimabanche that two significant things happened."
"croft had been charging and was literally steps behind chaverot at cimabanche but that was to be the closest she would get to chaverot who would step up the pace. antolinos was in fifth and some 31 minutes behind leader capell who was working hard to create a gap on swanson. from cimabanche to malga ra stua and eventually to col gallina at 95k after a steep climb, antolinos had made up those 31 minutes and was now in the lead. a superb section of running, but he did have a problem, a strong swanson was hot on his heels and looking to close that gap. seth swanson looking strong for second place. photo: irunfar/ian campbell it was at col gallina that capell, who arrived in third, would drop with dehydration issues. this put italian favoritefulvio dapitin third ahead of hermansen. but it was not this norwegian that he had to fear, it was another one,erik-sebastian krogvig, who had been running in seventh or eighth most of the way. by passo giau at 104k, krogvig was hot on the heels of dapit. by the time chaverot had reached col gallina, she had put 25 minutes on croft and it was only to stretch out more as the remaining kilometers passed by. after losing the lead to swanson briefly over the remaining climb, fabien antolinos had managed to fight back to regain his lead. he came into cortina with around a two-minute lead, leaving him the opportunity to savour the crowds cheering as he came to the finish line for his first major victory. he ran a smart race. krogvig had also raced hard and smart and unfortunately for dapit took the third and last place on the podium. fabien antolinos on his way to winning the 2017 lavaredo ultra trail. photo: irunfar/ian campbell the announcers called her the ‘queen of cortina’ and who could deny her that title, caroline chaverot powered her way to the finish line to claim yet another impressive victory and her second at lavaredo. croft had run a tough race, had tried to hustle chaverot, but was out paced. that said, she never gave in and was rewarded with second place. borzani ran strong all the way, holding third place from way back before refugio aurunzo but was unable to sustain the pace of either chaverot or croft. caroline chaverot, 2017 lavaredo ultra trail champion. photo: irunfar/ian campbell full results. erik-sebastian krogvig taking third at the 2017 lavaredo ultra trail. photo: irunfar/ian campbell full results. lisa borzani after taking third. photo: irunfar/ian campbell related articles:"
"hot weather and the snow, mud, and water remnants of a 100-year winter event in california’s sierra nevada worked together to create difficult racing conditions for the 2017western states 100. it was in those conditions that south africa’sryan sandesand the usa’scat bradleywon. this was sandes’s fifth shot at the race, and it improves upon his previous second place, fifth place, dns, and dnf. and bradley’s win represents a breakout performance among a super-competitive field in her first go at the event. top finishers in both the men’s and women’s fields are the runners who seemed to tolerate the conditions and race with a self-preservational style.alex nicholsandmark hammondrepresented the rest of the men’s podium, whilemagdalena bouletandsabrina stanleymade up the balance of the women’s. a special thanks todrymaxfor making our coverage of the western states 100 possible! thanks also toaltraandgu energyfor their support of our western states coverage. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. just 3.5 miles into the 2017 western states 100, over the race’s high point at 8,713 feet,jim walmsley(pre-race interview) led the entire men’s field by seven minutes, making a straightaway statement that he, indeed, would try to carry out his pre-race plans of racing these 100 miles aggressively. the next time that the irunfar team saw walmsley, atop red star ridge 15 miles into the race, he’d grown his lead to 18.5 minutes. by all descriptions these 15 miles of trail contained the remnants of the region’s 100-year winter of snow, mud, running water, downed trees, and obliterated trail surfaces. it was conditions which slowed the rest of the field considerably—from the front to the back of the pack—but conditions which walmsley most certainly pushed through. jim walmsley topping out on the escarpment at mile 3.5 well ahead of everyone else. photo: irunfar/jake beiler from here to mile 56, at michigan bluff, walmsley significantly increased his gap on the rest of the field. here it is in numbers: at mile 24 he was 30 minutes up on the field, 37 minutes at mile 30, 40 minutes at mile 38, 38 minutes at mile 43, 47.5 minutes at 48 miles, and 56 minutes at mile 55. each time that we saw him during this stretch, he looked pretty darn solid to us. that said, looking back on how walmsley’s day would ultimately play out, perhaps there was at least one clue that things weren’t quite perfect. at mile 38 in the dusty corners aid station, walmsley spent a full 4.5 minutes. a couple of those minutes went similarly to the other lead men—where he spent time dousing himself with water and ice and hydrating—but he also spent a couple minutes stretching, talking about “resetting,” and kind of just standing there. at mile 62 in foresthill, walmsley’s gap over the rest of the field began to decrease. even worse, his crew would later report that he vomited there. mile 71, about halfway between foresthill and the river crossing along the infamous cal street, walmsley reported stomach issues again."
"the heat of the day was at this point on, with temperature reports of 100 degrees fahrenheit in michigan bluff and the mid-90s in foresthill, what amounts to just a bit above normal for this region. between there and the river, walmsley’s race fully fell apart and he ended up laying on the ground and in the shade. he’d eventually make it to the river crossing at mile 78 and drop, citing that he hadn’t been able to eat in hours. it was thusly gastrointestinal distress—a common ultrarunning ailment especially in long races with hot temperatures when the stomach fails to digest at normal rates due to blood shunting from the stomach to the extremities to help cool the body—that appears to have ended walmsley’s day. jim walmsley (left) ending his day at the river. photo: irunfar/bryon powell and then there was the rest of the men’s field and men’s race, which seemingly operated on a parallel but equally dynamic storyline. rewinding to mile 15, we weren’t surprised to see the chase pack being led by sweden’selov olsson—who threatened in hispre-race interviewto do so—and france’serik clavery, who always starts races fast. at mile 24, the men shuffled places and south africa’sryan sandes(finish-lineandpost-raceinterviews) had moved into second position, with olsson and countrymanjonas buud(pre-race interview) running together in third and fourth positions. i was actually surprised to see buud as far up as he was here relative to the bulk of the men’s field, as he’s typically a conservative starter who moves up later. this makes me wonder if buud’s racing strategy was influenced by wanting to run with another swede or something else? by mile 30, sandes was starting to make his mark on the race and setting himself apart from the rest of the field. though he was 37 minutes back of leader walmsley, he was now eight minutes ahead of every other runner. this situation—sandes in second position and set ahead of the rest of the men’s field—would continue for some 40-plus miles to where he would overtake walmsley and move into first place. once sandes took over the lead, he had 22-plus miles to the finish. in that time, sandes would increase his gap over the rest of the field from a little over 10 minutes to 29 minutes, demonstrating his capability and strength in the day’s difficult conditions, first snow and mud and more in the race’s first 15-plus miles and then the normal-but-always-baking heat later. ryan sandes winning the 2017 western states 100. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the race for the men’s top 10 continued to be dynamic and enthralling. early pace pushers buud and olsson still occupied third and fourth positions at mile 30, though buud had gapped olsson by five minutes. in the fifth position at mile 30 was now clavery. move eight miles down the course to dusty corners and the game changed again, with clavery and olsson dropping back as opposed tochris denucciandalex nichols(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) moving up. while we couldn’t know it just yet, this was a foreshadowing of what was yet to come."
"fast forward to michigan bluff at mile 56, and buud was at the cusp of falling out of the men’s top five as he began to struggle. at the same time, nichols moved up to third position looking calm and collected in the canyons during the heat of the day. also having moved up was spain’stòfol castanyer, who had been running in fourth at michigan bluff before missing a turn, spending significant time off course, and dropping back many places on his way to foresthill. alex nichols enjoys the shade of his hat at the american river crossing. photo: irunfar/bryon powell by mile 71, the men’s podium was sorting itself out, as nichols and, now,mark hammond(post-race interview) had floated to the top and held steady in their positions of third and fourth. that said, hammond pressured the heck out of nichols in the race’s final quarter. between the river crossing at mile 78 and the auburn lakes trails aid station at mile 85, hammond cut the gap he had to nichols from 10 minutes to three. this drama heightened, though, because when nichols and hammond crossed the iconic no hands bridge at mile 97, they were separated by just 30 seconds. nichols must have absolutely hammered starting then, as upon hitting robie point, the top of the final climb and just 1.3 miles from the finish, a full four minutes separated the pair, how they’d ultimately finish. mark hammond after placing third at western states. photo: irunfar/bryon powell now what about the rest of the men’s top 10? well, now is presently a great time to be a fan of trail ultrarunning, where competitive, long races like this one continue to move and shake all the way through the finish. remember that guyjeff browning(pre-race interview), who finished third last year? yeah, he’s someone you just don’t want behind you at any point of the second half of a long ultra—he’s got a career that’s built on passing late-race carnage. browning, who would ultimately finish fourth, didn’t even see the back end of the men’s top 10 until mile 78. wrap your head around that one. by mile 94, browning moved into fourth position and hammered that one all the way home. though browning has loads of 100 milers under his belt—a great knowledge foundation—25-year-oldavery collinsplayed the field in precisely the same manner. in basically an 8.5-mile stretch of trail starting at foresthill, mile 62, he ran from 13th into sixth position. it appeared that he continued to push from there home and we saw him move up to as high as fourth place before he ultimately finished sixth. a lot of racing wisdom in a 25 year old! and what would a modern-era western states top 10 look like if it didn’t includeian sharmanand his very similar second-half-move-up strategies? m6 last year, sharman brought home the m7 position in 2017. one more dude raced like this, too,jesse haynes, 10th last year and now eighth this year."
"future men’s top-10 hopefuls, take note that browning, sharman, and haynes were close together in 15th through 18th and an hour off the lead and five minutes out of the top 10 at mile 30. jeff browning crossing the western states finish line with his kids. photo: irunfar/bryon powell denucci took home m9 last year through a steady-eddy, all-day performance, and same goes for this year. it seemed he was decisively present in the middle part of the men’s top 10 in the race’s first quarter, and though he hopped around positions pretty much all day, he improved to claim the m5 position for this year. chris denucci heading to the american river crossing. photo: irunfar/bryon powell scotland’spaul giblin, who took fifth last year, went on a rampage during the first half of cal street after foresthill—not unlike collins—and moved up from 10th to fifth position. it was a spot he would not be able to hold, however, as he would lapse back to his ultimate ninth-place spot. paul giblin just after his second-straight top-10 finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell last year’s m8kyle pietari(post-race interview) rounded out the men’s top 10 as he limped over the finish line, needed to be carried away from it, and claimed his belt buckle at the award ceremony the next day on crutches. we learned that he sprained his ankle by rolling it badly at mile 7. that makes it all the more of a feat that he landed in the m10 position. kyle pietari finishing out another top-ten finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell early pace pushers castanyer, buud, olsson, and clavery all finished, but outside the men’s top 10 in 11th, 12th, 13th, and 16th overall, respectively. particularly heartbreaking has to be castanyer’s finish in 11th after a 12th last year, just outside the men’s top 10. tòfol castanyer ran with heart. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. check outvideos of the top-three men finishing. the 2017 western states 100 men’s top 10. photo: irunfar/bryon powell it is safe to say that the 2017 western states 100 women’s race was highly anticipated. three previous champions, some more world-class talent, and a boat-load of up-and-comers among the entrants list made all of us talk about the potential of a race for the ages. add in heavy doses of high-country madness via reportedly soul-and-shoe sucking snow, mud, and water as well as the usual heat ingredient and, when all was said and done and the ladies connected the dots between #seeyouinquaw and #seeyouinauburn, actuality equaled hype. i realize i’m a woman and probably biased in my interest of women’s races, but holy hell the women’s race! amidst the insanity of jim walmsley’s early gap on the men’s field, i failed to notice the significant early stamp that switzerland’sandrea huserwas making on the women’s race, after initial leadercamille herron(pre-race interview) quickly succumbed to the high-country’s snow and mud."
"when we first saw huser at mile 15 along red star ridge, she was a full seven minutes in front of all the other women, what amounts to an effort at nearly 30 seconds per mile faster than the rest of the field. whoa. some 15 miles later, at the mile 30 robinson flat aid station, huser remained seven minutes ahead, holding steady. everything changed, though, at mile 38, whenyiou wang(pre-race interview) cruised in, leading the women’s field, having sliced through all of huser’s lead and gapped her by more than 1.5 minutes. at this point, huser began to continuously slip back in the women’s field. andrea huser would hold on to finish 10th. photo: irunfar/bryon powell let us thus move on to phase two of the women’s race for the win, where wang led and was closely chased by several other women. each time we saw the women at miles 43, 48, 56, and 62, wang was ahead, but it was close—a few minutes here and there separated her from her chasers. at foresthill, mile 62,cat bradley(finish-lineandpost-raceinterviews) was second just seconds behind. nonetheless, wang looked rock solid as she headed down cal street after foresthill. all of this would change in just a few short miles as she would—like men’s leader jim walmsley—come to a full stop on the ground. wang experienced some serious health issues that she would describe later on social media as numbness and hyperventilation. a lot of time passed (during, as we understand it, she was observed by the race’s medical team) before she’d get up, walk to the peachstone aid station at mile 71, and withdraw from the race. phase three of the race for the women’s lead began on the trail before peachstone, as bradley—who had been closely lurking at mile 62—took over leadership of the race. simply said, she ran from there untouched by any other woman for the race’s final 30 miles. that’s not to say that she didn’t feel pressure from behind, as she said after the race that she definitely ran faster because she knew strong women were running swiftly behind her. though some women may have been trying to hunt her down, she only increased her lead over them. when bradley passed a soon-to-dnf wang between miles 66 and 70, the former was 13 minutes ahead of the next woman still chasing her. after that, she led by nine minutes as mile 78, 12 minutes at mile 80, 13 minutes at mile 85, 12 minutes at mile 94, 15 minutes at mile 97, and 18 minutes at the finish. bradley closed out phase three in the race for the win as the women’s champion in, undoubtedly, a huge breakout performance. cat bradley cooling down before the river crossing. photo: irunfar/bryon powell magdalena boulet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews),2015 western states champion, andsabrina stanley(post-race interview), another young runner having a breakout performance, would cross the line in second and third place, completing the women’s podium. though they finished with just 22 minutes separating them, their journeys there were unique."
"boulet ran most of the race in the women’s top five and among the women in the race’s final two thirds who were constantly pressuring the race leader. boulet would say after the race that the high-country conditions took a lot out of her legs and that, as a result, she was forced to run carefully for many miles in order to manage her physical well being. that said, i think all bets were officially off during the final 25 miles or so when she was working hard, running swiftly, and hunting for the lead. during this, we saw her four times, at miles 80, 85, 94, and 97, and the woman definitely had her chase on. stanley, on the other hand, raced for the first 30 miles outside of the women’s top 10, cracking it for the first time at the robinson flat aid station, mile 30. she’d stay there at mile 38, run in 11th at mile 43, and in 11th again at mile 48. after that, at mile 56 in michigan bluff, she’d moved up to eighth place, but she was only getting started. a few miles later in foresthill, mile 62, she was seventh. at mile 71, she had cracked the women’s top five. holy smokes she was on fire. the overtaking of fourth and fifth places came in due course, and stanley would round out the women’s podium. sabrina stanley making good time through foresthill. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks fourth-placekaytlyn gerbintook a page out of the go-easy-then-chase-hard playbook with her run. quite honestly, the irunfar team didn’t even see gerbin for well over half of the race, as we’d departed aid stations bound for the next ones before she passed through them well outside the women’s top 10, so i don’t know much about how the first two thirds of her race went. however, i do know that the woman must have hammered the bottom half of cal street, between miles 71 and 78, as she arrived to mile 78 at the rucky chucky river crossing as seventh female. what? where’d she come from? it went on like this from there to the finish where gerbin would continue to move up until her ultimate finishing position. kaytlyn gerbin finishing in fourth. photo: irunfar/bryon powell new zealand’sfiona hayvicefinished fifth! we’d watched her race a couple times at the tarawera ultramarathon, so we were aware of her ability to race well on her home turf. thus, i was interested in seeing how she’d shake out among the high-level field assembled at western states. well, things shook out pretty darn well! like so many of the women who ultimately finished in the women’s top 10, a conservative start, gradual move-up into the top 10, and steady finish formed her winning recipe. a joyful fiona hayvice upon finishing fifth. photo: irunfar/bryon powell nicole kalogeropoulostook sixth place, matching precisely her 2015 finishing place and avenging her dnf last year. nicole kalogeropoulos earning her second sixth-place states finish."

"photo: irunfar/meghan hicks when we spotted cédric fleureton and luis alberto hernando at 39k, cédric still held his gap of two minutes over luis, but luis looked like the stronger man and that it was only a matter of real estate until he took over the lead. sure enough, on the tough terrain of the ridgeline between 38k and 44k, luis put the hammer down and took over the lead, and the rest was history. finland’s henri ansio continued to run in third, but was more worried about those behind him than in front of him. henri ansio running in third at 39km. photo: irunfar. we have to seriously tip our hats to cristofer clemente. check this out: 31st place at 9k, 18th at 25k, ninth place at 29k (and eight minutes back! ), eighth place at 35k, fourth place at 39k, and second place at the finish line–just a minute back from winner luis. for anyone who says that you have to stay in contact with the leaders early if you want to podium in a trail ultramarathon–even a ‘short’ one–there’s an incredible lesson in cristofer’s performance. more often than not, the way to run your own best race is to run your own race. cristofer clemente charging hard at 39km. photo: irunfar/bryon powell cédric fleureton ultimately finished in third place, succumbing to leg cramps in the final 12 kilometers, but still finishing strong as the first finisher of team france. finland’s ansio finished in fourth place, ending an all-day strong performance. rolling over the finish in fifth was daní garcia, meaning that team spain would take the team gold medal. spain wasn’t done though, and much like the total domination of team france in the women’s race,miguel caballerotook seventh andpablo villa10th. miguel caballero at 9km. photo: irunfar/bryon powell team france didn’t have the day they wanted–and weren’t able to defend their team gold medal from last year–but ultimately finished with a silver medal courtesy of the additional efforts of ludovic pommeret in sixth andbenoît coriin 14th positions. ludovic pommeret digging deep at 39km. photo: irunfar/bryon powell team usa hung in there for a bronze-medal finish, with mario mendoza working his way into the top 10 and finishing ninth, cody reed in 15th, and andy wacker in 20th. other early american pace pushers hayden hawks and david roche would finish, but both suffering energy and cramping issues. the top-three u.s. men from the 2017 trail world championships (l-to-r): cody reed, mario mendoza, and andy wacker. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. the 2017 trail world championships men’s team podium (l-to-r): 2. france, 1. spain, 3. usa. photo: irunfar/bryon powell updated june 17, 2017 thanks tokoichi iwasaofdogsorcaravanfor providing assistance on the course andmauri paggliaccioftrail running argentinafor providing off-site assistance. related articles:"

"at andratz, the top of the final climb 30k in to the race, his lead was around three minutes, and he’d maintain that gap on the blazing-fast downhill from there to the marathon’s finish line in downtown zegama, finishing in an official 3:45:08, well clear ofkilian jornet’s3:48:38course record from 2014. stian angermund-vik about to make his charge on the climb from sancti spiritu. photo: irunfar/bryon powell de gasperi, too, closed the race strongly. from andratz, 30k, to the finish line, 42k, he gave back no more time to winner angermund-vik and he increased the gap between he and third-placemarc lauenstein(pre-race interview), of switzerland, from under two minutes to more than five minutes. de gasperi’s official time of 3:48:20 was also inside the previous course best and five minutes faster than he’s ever run here. at the finish line, de gasperi attributed his fast time to both feeling strong in the race’s second half as well as the day’s weather and course conditions. marco de gasperi also went under the old course record. photo: irunfar/bryon powell third-place lauenstein took what looked like a similarly conservative approach as winner angermund-vik, running the race’s first half in the back half of the men’s top 10. at aratz, 16k, he summited the mountain in a train of five men running together in fifth to ninth place, which given that there was a really strong wind high on the mountain, looked like an smart strategy of working together and preserving energy. by aizkorri before 24k, the top of the second mountain, lauenstein moved into fifth position, and then up to third place by 28k. marc lauenstein would take third at zegama 2017. photo: irunfar/bryon powell in the end, egea would be the first basque runner home in finishing fourth, and france’sadrien michaud, who ran consistently inside the men’s top 10 the whole race, rounded out the men’s top five. this year, the top-six men all finished inside of the revered four-hour barrier, which we would say is roughly average over recent years at the race. scott teammates alexis sévennec and adrien michaud climbing above sancti spiritu. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. i admit that i didn’t know much about italy’ssilvia rampazzoahead of this race, but apparently i should have because she absolutely rampaged zegama, running hard from the start and setting the pace over much of the race’s first half. sixteen kilometers into the race at the first mountain summit of aratz, rampazzo looked super comfortable off the front and in the very strong winds there. again at sancti spiritu, 20k, and through the more-than-half-mile-long tunnel of fans, she pushed the hill, leaning into it, pressing down hard on her legs, and doing all that hard work with a smile. silvia rampazzo in the lead at sancti spiritu. photo: irunfar/bryon powell that said, behind rampazzo for the race’s first half, there was a lurkingmaite maiora(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). at aratz and sancti spiritu, maiora ran in second place less than 30 seconds off the lead."
"though she looked like she was physically working hard, there was also a sense of psychological peace in the expressions on her face. the wind of aratz didn’t seem to bother her, and she climbed through the throngs of basque fans screaming her name at sancti spiritu calmly and smoothly. honestly, she looked great. it was not a surprise, then, to see her top out on aizkorri, the second mountain summit, with a 90-second lead. maite maiora upon winning zegama in a course-record time. photo: irunfar/bryon powell maiora would say at the finish line that she thought rampazzo was tiring on the climb to aizkorri, but that she also said that she was mistaken in thinking so as, in reality, rampazzo still had a lot of fight in her. in the runnable terrain around urbia at 28k, rampazzo reeled maiora back in to within about 20 seconds. maiora would later say that she had to find another gear to climb the final mountain to andratz at 30k, so that she could gap rampazzo again. at andratz, maiora had reestablished her 90-second lead and, then, increased it by another almost 90 seconds from there to the finish line. maiora’s celebration at the finish was emotional. tears, smiles, and something like 30 minutes of continual embraces with her family and friends followed her 4:34:27 finish, what amounts to a huge new course record, close to four minutes better thanemanuela brizio’slongstanding4:38:19record from 2009. rampazzo’s performance was one of all-day strength. she crossed the line in downtown zegama looking tired, relieved, but still so strong. her 4:37:17 finish was also inside the previous course record. at the finish, she would say that she was only wanting to finish the race, and not expecting to win. last year’s terrible weather forced her to drop from the race, and she wanted to avenge her dnf. not only did she avenge 2016, but in the process she ran the second-fastest-ever time in the race’s long history. the third-place finish of spain’ssheila aviléswas another surprise for us–we didn’t even put her in our extensively researched preview, and no readers marked her as one to watch, either. we learned at the finish line, too, that zegama was avilés’s first marathon-distance race! well, she picked a difficult one to start with, didn’t she? it seems that avilés has been racing sky races for a couple seasons with success in both spain and italy. if maiora and rampazzo were the aggressors pushing the pace at the front in the women’s race, then avilés was the more conservatively paced runner. at aratz and sancti spiritu, she was in sixth and fifth places, respectively, and she would continue to move up in positions until reaching her ultimate finishing place by urbia at 28k. avilés had a really strong final 14k, all the more impressive given that it was her first marathon. at urbia, she was eight minutes behind winner maiora, and then nine minutes back at the finish line–she closed the race at almost the same pace as the women’s champ."
"even more evidence to her well-metered effort, in that same distance, she shook loose from several other women who were still within seconds to finish third and with no other women in sight for some four minutes. basque runneroihana azkorbebeitia, who ran much of the race in the back half of the women’s top 10, would move up to finish fourth place, and france’scelia chironfinished fifth, a position she ran in for much of the race. just as the four-hour barrier is well respected in the men’s race, so is the five-hour barrier for the women. this year, 11 women finished inside five hours, many more than what is the average. what a competitive women’s race! celia chiron staying focused at zegama. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. emelie forsberg enjoying the climb above sancti spiritu. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thank you tomauri pagliacciandgustiandinofor their coverage help! megan kimmel in the wind and the dust and the crowds of sancti spiritu. photo: irunfar/bryon powell related articles:"

"but ait malek played his cards brilliantly and flew down to tazacorte, marking the fastest downhill split, and finishing in third place in 7:26:31. martin was finally fourth, less than two minutes back, in 7:28:08. zaid ait malek took over the third podium position in the race’s final section. photo: irunfar/nacho barranco frías daniel jung(italy) andhector haines(u.k.) made great progressive races, finishing in fifth and sixth positions. they also fought for those spots in the last six kilometers of the race. thévenard ended in seventh place,dmitry mityaev(russia) eighth,jason schlarb(usa) ninth, andmanuel anguita(spain) 10th. amazingly, while first through fifth places were separated by 33 minutes, the fight in the back half of the top 10 was tight with a spread of just 11.5 minutes between fifth and 10th places. full results. before the race, we chatted with sweden’sida nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and she said she was feeling fine, in good shape. that was certainly the truth. exactly as last year, she broke herself from the rest of the field and ran her own race in front, pushing hard from start to finish. as far as 23 kilometers in a 75k race, she already had a gap of over eight minutes to her immediate follower,anne-lise rousset(france). just as last year. nilsson mastered this course again, winning this race from start to finish, finishing in the top 20 overall in 8:04:17. just to add a detail, she suffered a fall in the downhill that required a few stitches in her knee. ida nilsson, 2017 transvulcania ultramarathon champion. photo: irunfar/mauri pagliacci rousset had to fight to keep her second place. even though she ran by herself in this position for most of the race, the difference between she and her chasers was really close. and that’s because the usa’shillary allen(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andragna debats(netherlands) were working progressively and pushing each other for the podium spots. so close was that, at the 50k mark in el roque de los muchachos, the gap between the three was only six minutes. rousset to allen four minutes, allen to debats only two minutes. but this race is always defined in the downhill and this was no exception. rousset managed to open a few more minutes that allowed her to repeat last year’s second place in 8:32:15. anne-lise rousset on her way to taking second for the second time. photo: irunfar/nacho barranco frías even though she suffered some cramps in the downhill, allen escaped from debats and improved her fifth place from last year to a third place this year, in 8:38:46. finally, debats was fourth in 8:45:22. hillary allen on the bottom part of the race’s 8,000 foot descent. photo: irunfar/miguelito rodriguez eva mariá moreda(spain) cruised the whole race in fifth place, running solid and steady."

"jim walmsleyandcamille herronran with off-the-front authority for 102 kilometers through the lakes, forests, and hills between rotorua and kawerau, new zealand to win the 2017tarawera ultramarathon. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. is there anything else to say except thatjim walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was dominant? from “go,” jim set the pace. he was accompanied for some four kilometers before breaking free of everyone else and running solo for the next 98k to the finish line. we’d prepared a set of “walmsley absolutely ridiculous splits,” which we developed based upon a 7:15 finish time that we thought implausible, but not impossible. however, we basically ended up using them to key our next moves all day long. when the route came out of the woods briefly at just over 11k, jim came out talking about how he’d almost been knocked out cold by a run-in with a massive tree branch a kilometer or so prior. he was okay, all was okay, and he would later say he continued on without more than a few-seconds delay. at 57k, it looked like he might be experiencing a low point. he later attributed it to the fact that he was coming off the race’s most technical terrain where he tried hard to chill and not push hard. on the cruise-y terrain after 72k, i’m guessing jim’sgpsdata will show he logged some of his fastest splits. without a doubt, jim’s performance was a step above what men are doing at the ‘front of the pack’ in our sport right now. jim walmsley running strong late in tarawera. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks in the days ahead of the race, defending championjonas buud(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) defined his goals around improving upon his own previous performances. he simply wanted to run faster this year than last year. ultimately, he found himself limited by problems running downhill starting at 30k into the race, what would evolve into blown quads by the finish. after the race he said that perhaps this was the result of less running training and more cross training over the winter and unseasoned quadriceps. despite his ailing quads and running a bit slower than last year, he held things together better than everyone but walmsley, and ended up in second place. as early as around 11k into the race, jonas had settled into his totally expected position, within the chase pack of men running a controlled pace. it would be ages and ages, until something like two thirds of the race had passed, that he would be able to shake the rest of the runners and assume the second position, which he would hold to the finish. jonas buud wrapping up another podium performance at tarawera. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks before the race, several people said in describing new zealand’ssam mccutcheon(post-race interview), “he’s the real deal.” the guy who’s had a couple years of success nationally took things abroad in 2016 to take 10th at the buff epic ultra, one of the skyrunning world championships races."
"all of what we knew about him led us to believe that he could contend for the men’s top five. and here he is, having finished third, a position he ran near to for much of the race, and less than two minutes out of second place. from the very first time we saw him after 11k, he was in the top-five mix, a position he’d maintain all race. sam moved up into third position in the race’s final quarter, easing up close to, but never in sight of, second-place buud. sam mccutcheon making himself known outside australasia with his third-place finish. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks david byrne(pre-race interview), second here last year, came back for a fourth-place finish, running a couple minutes faster than 2016. 2016 ultra-trail world tour championgediminas griniusrounded out the men’s top five with a totally steady performance. full results.

"magda ran in second position for pretty much the entire race. at times, she looked quiet and focused, while in others she opened up smiles for her husband and son, who crewed her. early on, she kept the gap to leader camille within just a couple minutes, before it opened wider in the race’s second half. magda was challenged by a late-charging cecilia flori during a time when she didn’t feel very well. the pair worked together before magda pulled ahead to take second by a narrow margin. magda boulet finishing tarawera in second with her son… just ahead of her. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks cecilia flori(post-race interview) is italian who lives in new zealand. to be frank, at the time of this writing, we don’t know much about her–we’ll interview her post-race, though, so stay tuned! as far as we understand from irunfar’s kiwi friends, cecilia is a relatively new trail and ultrarunner, and possibly a new competitive runner. in 2016, she won another local race, the taupo 100k, in a time that would have been quite good for many men and a time that made people take notice of her. for whatever newness she may have, cecilia did not come out of the gate carefully and conservatively. by 17k, she moved right into fourth position, and held it there for a good, long time. cecilia made her way into third position in the race’s final third. if sam mccutcheon is the real deal, then cecilia is, too. italy’s cecilia flori gave magda boulet a run for second, before finishing third. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks kellie emmerson, an aussie trail phenom, showed she can play with the big guns in her fourth-place finish, andmargie campbelltook a strong fifth place. full results.

"a combination of perfect weather, a slightly different course, and ridiculous competition led to incredibly fast times at this year’sthe north face endurance challenge 50 mile championships. after fierce battles,zach miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andida nilsson(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) came out on top with fast finishes right behind them fromhayden hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andmagdalena boulet(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews). truly, this year’s race was the pinnacle in the event’s 10-year history in the marin headlands. below, we dive into the full story. zach miller after winning his second-straight tnf 50. photo: irunfar/bryon powell thank you tothe north facefor supporting our coverage of this race. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back. to get all the latest trail and ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. over the past decade, there have been few things more spectacular than watchingzach miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) go out at breakneck pace in races and, often enough, sticking it. well, today that was topped byhayden hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) getting into a veritable game of go-for-it chicken against mr. miller with the only loser in the deal being the six-hour barrier. from the gate, miller went to the front only to have hawks charge off and push the pace. back and forth it would go for much of the day. neither relented despite running “stupid” per miller. sometimes you jump on the crazy train and it takes you to an incredible destination. such was the case today. with roughly 5 kilometers to go, zach still had a mere one-minute lead to his credit so he ran 16 minutes to the finish to win by barely two minutes. this duel from gun to line was incredible to witness in person. hayden hawks continuing his charge at mile 32. photo: irunfar/bryon powell behind miller and hawks there were three sets of folks toward the front: the implosions, the steadies, and the chargers. in the early going, folks likecody reed(pre-race interview),benoît cori, andtim freriksamongst others went out within sight of the leaders to fade quite a bit later on. in the middle, folks likejorge maravilla(pre-race interview) were mister consistents. i don’t think i saw jorge outside of the range of fourth-to-sixth place all day. he finished fourth. greek runnerdimitris theodorakakossits ninth, eighth, and eighth in my notes before finishing sixth. likewise,paddy o’learyseemingly hung around ninth or 10th place throughout the day. some folks would drop back fast, a few others would sneak past, but on paddy would go to take ninth. dimitris theodorakakos shows that there’s something still to be said for running a consistent effort. photo: irunfar/bryon powell dang, if there’s someone that’ll have a leader checking his shoulder at the end of an ultra these days, it’sdavid laney(post-race interview). he was in 11th at mile 20 and was in fourth 13 miles later. he’d finish third. i’m pretty sure thatalex nichols(pre-race interview) had to come from a lot further back to take fifth. he was in the late-teens at best at mile 10 and only cracked the top 10 nearly two thirds of the way through the race."

"this year, she employed a more conservative start, and didn’t move herself into the realm of podium position until about halfway through the race. at around mile 25, ruth and magda were running together in third and fourth, a battle that would continue for some miles. in this section, ruth would also briefly give challenge to ida, who at the time was running in second position behind the still-leading megan. ruth would ultimately drop back behind ida and magda, but her conservative start perhaps led her to run strong to the finish for third place. at mile 32, ruth croft runs in third, which is where she’d finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell fourth place went to canadianannie jean, whose best performance in trail and ultrarunning until now is probably a 12th place at the 2016 world long distance mountain running championships. she’s also been the winner of many local ultras in canada. as early as mile 10, annie was running in sixth position, a spot she would roughly hold for quite a long way before she would pick off a few positions for fourth place. annie jean coasting along along the coast. photo: irunfar/bryon powell clare gallagherran an impressive race in that she went out close to the leaders in the early going, dropped back to the 10th at mile 32, before fighting her way back up to fifth at the finish. if clare yo-yoed a bit,sandi nypaverwas a winch in that she started a ways back and kept reeling in the runners ahead of her. she didn’t crack the top 10 until around mid-race, was eighth by mile 25.5, and finished sixth.kasie enmanran a consistent race, hanging between fourth and sixth for most of the race before finishing seventh. kasie enman on her way to seventh. photo: irunfar/bryon powell keely henningerbounced around ninth and 11th for much of the race before earning eighth.stephanie howe violett(pre-race interview) says she’ll be happy to have 2016 behind her, especially now that it goes out with her finishing in the top 10 at such a strong 50 miler. early leadermegan kimmel(pre-race interview) suffered calf issues late in the race that quickly dropped her back to 10th. if we recall correctly, a similar issue afflicted kimmel late in the 2012 edition of the tnf 50. stephanie howe violett closes out a rough 2016 with a ninth-place finish. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. race reports articles and photo galleries irunfar has received an incredible outpouring of support from the marin area trail running community, and our race-week coverage has been the conglomerate work and support of some 20-plus people. we are so grateful. thank you to dylan bowman as well as brett rivers of the san francisco running company for hosting our pre-race interviews. thank you to the following people who volunteered to help deliver our race-day live coverage: kirsten kortebein, francois grenier, charlie avis, chris blagg, maili costa, charity thurman, ezra becker, rudy rutemiller, misha shemyakin, gilbert lemieux, and hal rosenberg."

"the lottery for the 2017western states 100took place today, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few top runners. however, most top runners either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. a total of 4,248 runners entered the lottery for the 2017 edition, up from 3,510 applicants for the 2016 race and 2,566 for the 2015 edition. a total of 11,021 tickets went into today’s drawing representing those runners. the starters list in june of 2017 will ultimately contain 369 runners, a number decided by the race’s permit through the granite chief wilderness. among this there will be 117automatic entrants(some decided and some yet to be decided), 2 that were drawn from those who were in the audience for the lottery itself, and 250 runners who were chosen in today’s lottery. an interesting change was announced to the ws100 entrance process this past july, and will be implemented for the first time this year, a 50-person ‘general wait list.’ if a registered entrant decides not to race, members of the waitlist will move onto the entrants list. today, that wait list was also filled from among the lottery entrants. the ws100 website has an up-to-date list of the 2017 western states 100entrantsas well asthe wait listers. let’s take a look at the top runners who have made it into ws100 so far. the women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2017, and every woman has chosen to do so! the men’s top 10 from 2016are also invitedto return. the only man who has chosen not to return isdidrik hermansen, who took second place. this number of top-10 returnees (19 out of 20) is believed to be a record and is truly indicative of the prestige associated with a top-10 finish. these are some speedy men and women who achieved entry to next year’s race via one of theother pre-lottery auto-entry methods. here they are and how they obtained their entry: a total of 250 names were drawn during today’s lottery, and among them were a small number of speedy and notable athletes. here are the top entrants on the 50-person general wait list: top runners still have three routes by which they can gain non-lottery entry into the 2016 ws100. golden ticket races the six-racealtra golden ticket racesoffers up to 24 ws100 entries will be given to top finishers of these races. the series remains unchanged in the number of races participating, which races, and the system by which runners can gain ws100 entry. basically, the top-2 men and top-2 women finishers of each race gain entry, and if they already have an entry or if they decline it, the entry rolls down as far as fifth place. ultra-trail world tour for 2017, six slots are given to top international contenders via the ws100’s participation in theultra-trail world tour.update, december 22:the race administration has announced the utwt slots today."

"congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2017hardrock hundred endurance run! this article breaks down the results of today’s lottery for the run’s 2017 edition. first, we begin with a few statistics and background information. this year’s lottery entrants list was up to 1,966 applicants. for perspective, the lottery for the 2016 edition had 1,549 entrants, and the previous year was 1,367 applicants. these 1,966 entrants were represented by 8,490total ticketswhich went into today’s lottery ‘buckets.’ prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants into one of three divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. the divisions are ‘veterans,’ runners who’ve finished hardrock more than five times; ‘nevers,’ which are runners who’ve never finished hardrock; and ‘everyone else,’ runners who’ve completed the event between one and four times. for the 2017 lottery, there were 43 veteran applicants who had 404 tickets, 1,722 never applicants with 7,339 tickets, and 201 everyone else applicants with 747 tickets. the 2017 edition will feature 145 starters, a decrease from 152 starters from 2016. this change was announced by the event organization in late august to address adverse impacts on the event’s quality and management as a result of 152 entrants, their pacers and crew, and those who attend in person. as a result of the change in field size, there was a change in the number of entrants selected from each division. today, the event organization selected 33 veterans, 45 nevers, and 67 everyone elses. for perspective, the 2016 edition contained 35 veterans, 47 nevers, and 70 everyone elses. run directordale garlandprivately chose five of the entrants, ‘dale’s picks,’ and the balance of the entrants were chosen from the lottery ‘buckets.’ the 2016 event represented a decrease from the past in terms of the number of runners who got into the event off the three separate devision-specific waitlists. for the 2016 edition, the waitlists eventually yielded entrants spots only 4deep in the veterans division, 4 deep in the nevers division, and 7 deep in the everyone else division. for the 2015 edition, the waitlist went to 8 deep for the veterans (which included all of the veterans on the waitlist that year), 9 deep for nevers, and 12 deep for everyone else. even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end continues to grow in competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which hardrock prides itself upon. below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2017 contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in. let’s start with the men’s competition.kilian jornetandjason schlarbtied for the win in the 2016 run, and they’ve both chosen to use their automatic entries for the 2017 edition."
"so there’s that.additionally,zach miller, who has been absolutely on fire over the last several years, will add an interesting mix up front.iker karrerawill return for another go on this course that suits his talents, andadam campbellwill be coming back from a recent near-fatal climbing accident after two podium finishes in 2014 and 2015. you can never count out a guy likemike footewho was runner up to jornet in 2015 and does well on this brutal course. as usual with hardrock, there are several very competitive veterans includingscott jaime,karl meltzer, andjoe grant.chris pricealways seems dialed in at hardrock and he will be looking to improve on his two fourth place finishes. when all was said and done in the women’s 2016 race, championanna frostsaid she was sure she’d return to the 2017 race, but that she was unsure if that meant as a competitor or as a volunteer. it looks like she’s chosen to be a competitor.while it is hard to imagine anyone challenging frost after last year’s victory, there is some amazing competition on the women’s side this year. one runner that could pull the upset isdarcy piceu, a three-time winner at hardrock. piceu and frost leap-frogged during a very competitive 2015 hardrock, and we’ve all been waiting for the rematch. both of these runners will be pushed hard by 2015 utmb champnathalie mauclairwho seems to excel in any terrain. throw incaroline chaverot, who is on fire in the trail-ultrarunning scene and who is coming off a 2016 utmb victory, and you have the most competitive field in history up front for the women’s hardrock title. third- and fourth-place finishersbethany lewisanddarla askewwill be returning after big days at last year’s hardrock, andrachel bucklinwill be trying to best her seventh-place 2016 finish. you can never count out the indefatigablebetsy kalmeyer, who will be seeking her 18th finish and who was second as recent as 2014, andbetsy nyewho has been on the podium 11(!) times at hardrock and who was sixth this year. here is the full list of who was chosen in the lottery, and on the various waitlists. let’s get on with the full lists of who is in, who may be, and who is definitely not. there is only one way to gain auto entry into hardrock, and that is by winning the prior year’s race.kilian jornet,jason schlarb, andanna frosthave all chosen to use those entries. here are the notable men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. here are the women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. here are the front-end men’s contenders who were chosen in the top-10 slots of the veterans waitlist, the top-15 slots of the nevers waitlist, or the top-20 slots of the everyone else waitlist. these men have some shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-10 slots of the veterans waitlist, the top-15 slots of the nevers waitlist, or the top-20 slots of the everyone else waitlist. these women have some shot of running."

"however, by the time we saw caroline next at 75k, she’d gotten word of how close her chasers were, and she was in serious ‘go’ mode. the woman was giving everything, pushing, breathing hard, so focused. she’d rebuilt an almost-five-minute lead, which she would maintain through the finish. azara garcía climbing toward the course’s high point and on her way to second place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell let’s put it this way, i think azara knows how to suffer. when we saw her last at 75k, when she was being chased closely by ragna, she was deep in the pain cave and giving it. it was perhaps because of her ability to motor through difficulty that she increased her lead from one minute at 75k to three minutes at the finish. to be sure, this was the tightest women’s podium race we’ve seen at a long ultra in quite a while. ragna debats would take third. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the steadiness of the women’s competition would not end there. when all was said and done in the top 10, 65 minutes separated first and 10th place. for perspective, 49 minutes separated first and 10th at last year’s the north face endurance challenge 50-mile championships, though that race ran a full 2.5 hours faster. and the spread between the men’s top 10 at this race was 41 minutes. it’s possible that this women’s race is of the kind of depth we’ve not yet seen in trail ultrarunning. two-time defending iau trail world championnathalie mauclair(pre-race interview) of france put most of her racing eggs into this basket. after a mostly quiet season and two iau trail world championships victories in a row, i think nathalie really wanted to win again. however, we learned at the finish that she took a hard fall on the first major descent and injured her ribs. she said that every downhill step from there was painful and that she considered dropping several times. in the end, i think nathalie’s perseverance and desire to help with team france’s performance won out, and she slowly moved up positions to finish fourth. spain’sgemma arenastook fifth in what looked like a steady performance start to finish. sixth place was switzerlands’skathrin götz, who i admittedly know nothing about except that she finished second at the eiger ultra trail this year, a half hour behind trail-ultra superstar andrea huser and a few minutes ahead of juliette blanchet. great britain’sjo meek(pre-race interview) andbeth pascallfinished seventh and eighth. the czech republic’smichaela mertová, who has seen some success in the skyrunning sphere, was ninth. spain’steresa nimestook 10th for the second year in a row with france’saurelia truelshortly behind her in 11th. the pair completed the team duel for the win. the combined three fastest times are used to score, and it was team france with the finishes of caroline chaverot, nathalie mauclair, and aurelia truel whose combined times were the fastest. team spain took a very close second for the second year of the row, finish less than 14 minutes behind the french."
"nearly two and a half hours behind the french, team great britain rounds out the women’s team podium withjo zakrzewskias the third scoring woman in 29th place. full results. it’s funny, going into utmb a couple months ago, spain’sluis alberto hernando(pre-race interview) seemed so calm, comfortable, and, well, freaking fit. it almost felt sure that he’d be on the men’s podium there. but things went real wrong when he got debilitating blisters and dropped near the halfway point. perhaps there are blessings in curses, though, that he didn’t make it all the way through 100 miles in late august, which left him fresh for the iau trail world championships. that said, going into this race, he hedged his own bets, leaving us all wondering if he was trying to let us know that perhaps he wasn’t quite ready for this race. that said again, as soon as the race started, you could see the fire in his eyes and the fluidity with which he moved. it was easy to see as early as 30k that luis was in it to win it. luis alberto hernando, 2016 iau trail world champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks he bided his time, however, running among the leaders until after 40k. somewhere between there and 46k, on the long climb to the course’s high point, serra amarela, luis made his move. when we saw him on the far side of the mountain at 54k, he’d put some 3.5 minutes on france’snicolas martin(post-race interview), who was seventh at the world championships last year, and defending championsylvain court(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), with whom he’d been running at 40k. his lead increased, and his focus and pushing also seemed to. the dude was steam-train-esque. luis’s lead grew to as much as 13 minutes at 75k as he ran through a tiny village called bomio, before it reduced to 10 minutes at the finish. sylvain court headed toward third place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks i would venture a guess that the reduction in luis’s lead in the final 10.5k was not a matter of luis letting up on things, but, rather, due to the fight going on between nico and sylvain behind him. the pair were running what must have been at times in the last 20k in sight of each other, and they have a long back-and-forth racing history. they have gone head-to-head in just the last year-and-a-half in at least four big races: the 2015 iau trail world championships (sylvain bested nico), the 2016 transvulcania (nico beat sylvain), the 2016 france trail national championships (nico was declared the winner over sylvain), and here (nico bested sylvain). the gap between nico and sylvain’s respective finishes would be only 33 seconds at the finish. ultimately, half of the men’s top 10 filled with frenchmen, withbenoît coritaking fourth,ludovic pommeretfifth, andaurélien colletseventh. each of these men seemed to employ the strategy of running smart but staying in contact with the leaders as much as possible. the exception to this would be benoît at 30k, where he—but only briefly, as we understand—led the men’s race."

"with start-to-finish domination of their respective men’s and women’s fields,françois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andandrea huser(post-race interview) won thediagonale des fous, the 167-kilometer (104-mile) race which climbs 9,700 meters (31,800 feet) this weekend on réunion island. the day and then some that the lead runners spent traversing the island from roughly south to north brought diversity (and difficulty) of terrain and weather as well as a truly interactive experience with the tens of thousands of island fans who watched and cheered along the course. with this article we attempt to describe the men’s and women’s competitive races and the unique meshing of nature and culture that runners experience courtesy of the race’s popularity on the island. in addition to this article, you can find a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on ourddf live-coverage page. ps. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. the start of the 2016 diagonale des fous on réunion island. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks we’re starting this results article off a bit differently than usual because, well, the diagonale des fous is a different event. additionally, since this is the first time irunfar has covered the event and not a lot is known about it in the english-speaking trail world, we thought a baseline description of the race might be beneficial. the diagonale des fous was first run in 1989, and so the now 850,000 inhabitants of réunion island have had two-and-a-half decades to develop a relationship with the race. and what a relationship they have! the term ‘crazy’ is often applied to the race, and that’s a great basic description of fans’ excitement about the race. we heard estimates that some 20,000 people were predicted to watch the start and that 10% of the population would physically watch the race from somewhere on the course. and local radio and tv stations offered nonstop race coverage for days, so many more followed remotely. i would sincerely be surprised to meet an islander who hasn’t heard of the race. ddf has become one of the island’s main annual events and it captures everyone’s attention. [editor’s note:you can learn more about the race’s long history and its place in réunion island culturewith this essay.] many ddf fans behave like trail running fans i’ve seen around the world, but there’s a good deal of ‘freneticism,’ too, though that’s almost entirely focused on the lead couple men. though i can’t say for certain, it’s an educated guess based on observing the movements of other media that this is a result of local media focusing mostly on the lead couple men. i would venture a guess that, further back in the pack, and even with the top women, fans are still quite interactive in cheering for runners, but less wildly so. what do i mean by frenetic? smashing beer bottles in excitement at the start. jogging behind the leaders for some distances. creating a funnel of fans with hands reaching in to touch a runner as they pass."
"the starting line in saint-pierre, a large city on the southwest part of the island, is a true spectacle. the race organization presents a festival-like environment for non-participating islanders to come out and enjoy themselves. a concert of rotating local bands begins four hours before the race start. circus-type performers rove the crowd. people sell glow sticks, glow necklaces, glow pinwheel thingys, and noisemakers from rolling carts. others sell beer, water, and soda, and there are food trucks offering all sorts of food. at first the atmosphere is chill, with a core group of people in front of the concert stage dancing and partying. but starting about 90 minutes before the race, excitement mounts and people swarm, looking to get a view of the 50 or so top runners who are funneled into an ‘elite’ area and to get a viewing spot for the race start. the 2016 diagonale des fous starting-line party. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks the 2,500 or so runners are blocked off from the public into their own area. it’s not huge, but big enough for anyone who wants to sit or lay down to do so. it has one row of portapotties, but i was told that people urinate freely all over the participant area. there are also some tents offering drink and food for participants. this was by far the most solemn part of the start area–the runners largely lay about quietly, conserving energy. about 30 minutes from the start, the organization funnels participants into a street-wide chute connecting the 400 meters or so between the runner waiting area and the actual starting line. the energy of the five minutes it takes to do this is nuts. a line of volunteers links arms and strings themselves in front of the mass of runners to prevent a mad rush toward the start line (and possibly beyond? one year there was a false start when a loud noise made some jittery runners run off and everyone followed. there was no restart–that was the actual race start that year.) american runnerjoel meredithdescribed these few moments as chaotic with people sprinting to get an up-front starting place. once the runners are in place, it’s still a long wait until the actual start, 25 minutes or so. you see all kinds of behavior during this time: everything from runners and fans standing quiet and observing, to other fans leaning into the starting chute trying to get a photo of or an autograph from a runner, to fans and runners dancing and singing. by the time the race starts, the announcers and music have worked everyone but a few runners into excitement mode. loud and wild is the actual start. the course runs several kilometers on pavement before hitting the trails, and i was told that all of this pavement is a giant fan funnel. françois d’haene and patrick bohard share a quiet moment among the 2016 diagonale des fous starting-line frenetics. françois went on to win and patrick finished seventh. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks the course delivers every kind of terrain."
"there are kilometers of pavement connecting the route into and out of towns and villages. there’s developed singletrack in the national park that makes up the core of the island. there are dirt roads and pathways through private agricultural fields–a lot of sugar-cane fields and grazing grounds for cattle–cut just for the race. at the core of the race course is the cirque de mafate, a giant and road-less volcanic caldera that runners drop into at about 75 kilometers and climb out of at 115 kilometers. this section of the race is visually stunning. everywhere, all the time, is an insane view. many people recreate on the trails of mafate, which were first made more than 200 years ago to help slaves flee from their enslaved coastal lives and hide in the cirque. also, there are several villages where locals live year round in the cirque–maybe 50 to 100 dwellers in each of the villages. scenery inside the cirque de mafate, part of the diagonale des fous course. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks when you travel through mafate during the race, you’re traveling through a ridiculous natural spectacle, the home of several hundred people, and a place where both locals and tourists recreate (and come out to cheer the race). in most races, when you travel through a place as remote and inaccessible as mafate is, you’d be all by yourself for kilometers at a time. in ddf, you are constantly surrounded by people. a few runners described seeing people every few minutes to every few seconds, at times. the young ladies of roche plate, a roadless village in the cirque de mafate located at 109 kilometers into the diagonales des fous. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks unfortunately, with all these people came trash–produced by both runners and those observing the race. in my mind, there is no excuse for littering, period, let alone in a national park, let alone during a trail race. respect of nature should be a core value in this situation. the main issue i observed is toilet paper, but runners i talked to also spoke about significant litter from food wrappers. i hope the race organization chooses to address this problem. built stairs and rocks that require the stair-climbing or stair-descending motion seem like the dominant terrain. the trails do, in fact, have switchbacks, but the switchbacks are still super steep. this year, the course was dry and dusty in places, butgediminas griniussaid that one year it was quite muddy. while the course seems to always be trending toward ascending or descending, it’s never just doing one or the other. on a long ascent for example, say 800 meters, there will be some significant descent snuck in there. several runners said that you can’t find a rhythm because of these constant changes. “unceasing technicality” and “the most technical terrain i’ve ever seen” are two summaries i heard about the course. runners on the endless stairs of the ddf course. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks helicopter use is a reality on réunion island."
"with such steep and undulating terrain, helicopters help make life happen here. it’s how supplies are shipped into and refuse out of the villages of mafate, for example. as such, helicopters are wildly used during the race for media–and the helicopters absolutely hound the runners, getting incredibly close to the runners and the ground. if you’re in the top 10 or so, you will be followed closely by helicopters for several daylight hours in total. i’ve seen helicopters at a lot of european races, but never anything like what i saw at ddf. the finish line takes place in a stadium on the edge of saint-denis, the island’s biggest city located in the north of the island. again the carnival-type atmosphere is developed during the days that the racers of the ddf and the two, smaller sister races are finishing. there’s a beer tent, a food tent, booths and shops, a climbing wall, and more. locals bring lawn chairs, blankets, and coolers, and come and relax for a couple hours at time, likely to wait for a friend or family member to finish. however, the atmosphere is much more calm and with far fewer people than at the start. when the top couple men finish, there are perhaps 1,500 or 2,000 fans in and just outside the stadium. kind of funny to say there are that many fans on hand for a trail race and yet it had a ‘calmer’ feeling than the start. it’s still a huge party! second place this year was 10-time ddf finisherantoine guillon, who was also last year’s race winner. he’s quite popular with islanders. so, there was a lot of energy for the second-place finisher, too, but far fewer people watching even though he arrived only a half hour later. and then… it got scarily quiet. crowds gathered briefly again to seeandrea huserwin the women’s race, but probably 25% of the number who were there to seefrançois d’haenewin the men’s race. by the timeemma rocafinished in third place, the stadium was absolutely deserted. in all, it was a wild experience to witness and i’m guessing an even wilder experience in which to participate. france’sfrançois d’haene(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was, quite simply, in his own class… for 146 kilometers. for the race’s first 30 kilometers or so, françois ran among the lead men before emerging alone at the front at kilometer 35, with no one else within five minutes. he built a lead from there, slowly and surely, until maïdo at 115k where he was 80 minutes ahead of everyone in the men’s field. on whatever sort of terrain we saw him, he looked calm and in total control. even when tv cameras chased and helicopters blew debris on him, his composure was rock steady. françois d’haene at 29 kilometers into the ddf. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks but as if in prediction of his own future, when asked how he was feeling at 97k, he answered that he felt good but that it was a long way still."
"when we saw him next at 109k, in the middle of a 2,000-meter climb during the heat of the afternoon, he looked ever so ‘touched’ by the conditions. he sat for several minutes to rest and rehydrate, which seemed to reinvigorate him, and he took off uphill looking really well. to the media in maïdo at 115k and despite his lead, he admitted that he was feeling tired. françois was able to maintain his large lead from there to the town of possession at 146k. when he ran into town there, while being cheered for by hundreds of fans, you could see he was straining. from there over the next half-marathon distance to the finish, he gave up 50 minutes of his lead. but there was too little real estate left and he had too big of a buffer–françois was just too strong–and so he crossed the line as the 2016 diagonale des fous champion. he adds this to wins here in 2013 and 2014. françois d’haene, 2016 diagonale des fous champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks it’s safe to say that france’santoine guillon(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) loves réunion island and réunion island loves him. antoine started the 2016 edition as the defending champion and with nine previous finishes, what might amount for some people to a lot of pressure. if antoine felt any pressure, it was never visible. he’s the kind of guy you’d want around if there was an emergency–calm and able to stay the course no matter what. fans on the course referred to him as the ‘metronome,’ and this descriptor is so on point! his splits between last year and this year were often within a couple minutes, and his finish time this year was two minutes and a few seconds faster than in 2015. for the race’s first 68k, antoine ran within the men’s top 10. after that, there’s a gnarly climb to a col. it was in this section that antoine propelled himself into second position, where he would almost exclusively stay until the finish. likely a result of his ddf experience and his methodical approach to racing in general, antoine maintained a strong pace all the way, closing hard on françois ahead of him and maintaining the gap between he and third place. antoine guillon on his way to second place and his 10th ddf finish at marla, 80 kilometers into the race. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks it’s a little scary how easy spain’sjavi dominguez(post-race interview) made running ddf look. like antoine, javi took things out more conservatively, arriving to the first checkpoint at 15k a few positions outside of the top 10. in the honest uphill from there, however, javi moved himself up an equally honest number of positions to the edge of the top-five men. by the time he dropped into the cirque de mafate at 80k, he was in third position, where he would stay for the entire second half of the race."
"for the next 50k, however–javi would later say he had no idea what was happening in the race behind him–he had a string of men breathing down his neck. finally, at the town of possession at 146k, javi maintained his pace while the men behind him slowed ever so much that he increased his gap to fourth place. that said, over the race’s final 21k, the gap between he and second-place antoine stayed about the same as they progressed separately but at about the same rate. after finishing fifth here in 2014, javi hit it big this time with a podium finish. javi dominguez is elated with third place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks south africa’sryan sandesis back. i knew it was going to happen, but just didn’t know when. and to be 100% honest, i wasn’t sure that it would be at this race because he and his wife, vanessa, just had their first child a few weeks ago–an awesome undertaking. ryan had a huge 2014, performance-wise, and then he struggled with his health in 2015. and, it seems that the early part of 2016 was about getting his performance back to world-class level. ryan went out a bit faster than we’ve seen him in other competitive 100 milers, running inside the top 10 straight away. ryan and france’smaxime cazajouscrossed the line together to tie for fourth place. maxime finished 14th and over 28 hours in 2015 and he returned to better his position by 10 spots and his time by three hours–an incredible improvement. gediminas grinius didn’t finish ddf due to several physical issues, but he wins the 2016 ultra-trail world tour. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. did you enjoy theandrea huser(switzerland) (post-race interview) show? because it was a good one. for the race’s first 15k, andrea let other women take things out hot, and she arrived to the 15k checkpoint in fourth place. however, in the next 20k, she worked her way through the rankings and into first position by the time we next saw her at 29k. when asked how it was going at this point in the race, her answer was alarmingly casual. was there even a race going on, at least in her head? it was hard to tell! boom, boom, boom, at every aid station for the next 90k, she looked fresh and like she was hardly even sweating. and yet, she was decidedly putting time on the rest of the women’s field and, let’s just be honest, the men’s, too. in those 90 kilometers, she went from 54th position to 14th position in the general ranking. andrea huser climbing at 29 kilometers into ddf. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks at roche plate, located at 109k and halfway up the 2,000-meter climb to maïdo at 115k, a member of the media asked her if she thought she would win. she laughed as if it was a silly question, perhaps not because she thought it was a sure thing, but because the idea of winning was clearly the farthest thought from her mind at this point."
"like nearly all of the runners at this point, she said she was tired and she looked warm in the midday heat. that said, i saw her working it on the balance of the climb from there, and she was moving just fine. she would say after the race that it was the part of the climb above roche plate in which she felt the most tired. impressive, then, that she was moving as well as she was there. andrea has been on fire with her 2016 season, and here at ddf, she improves on last year’s third-place finish by two places and an hour. andrea huser, 2016 diagonale des fous champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks france’sjuliette blanchet(post-race interview) has a chill presence when she races. quiet and focused, but not edgy. a bit like javi dominguez on the men’s side, and such a presence makes running to second place at ddf look far easier than i know it must be. juliette started the race conservatively, arriving to the first checkpoint, domaine vidot at 15k, in about 150th position in the general ranking. she would say later that she doesn’t run as fast as other runners early in races, so she relies on being able to maintain the same effort through a whole event. by 29k, she’d worked her way to sixth position for the women, but was still outside the top-100 overall. and, then, by 51k, she had moved up to second place where she would remain for the rest of the race. while she would stay distant from race winner andrea huser, she built a solid cushion over the rest of the women’s field. two years ago here, juliette finished second in a late-race sprint with uxue fraile. this time, with no other women near, juliette could take things in and enjoy her second second-place finish. juliette blanchet looks chill at roche plate, 109 kilometers into ddf, on her way to a second-place finish. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks for spain’semma roca(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), this race did not come easy. but in talking with emma pre-race, it was clear she was expecting to be challenged by the course, the heat, and adjusting to the zero-drop altra shoes she’s been running in for the last three months. it seems she had prepared in advance for an eventuality of fighting for her finish. emma’s one of the toughest women i know, and to see how hobbled she was after the race–that’s when you know a race is a challenging one. after shifting around positions in the race’s first marathon, emma settled into third place where she would stay for 120-some-odd more kilometers. emma would explain after the race that she tried to push the downhill after 115k to make a bid for second place. but she said she just didn’t have it in her body, so she eventually crossed the line in third, a strong first showing at ddf. emma roca stays calm amidst pre-race insanity before the start of the 2016 ddf. she went on to finish third."

"americandakota jonesset the men’s race pace from early on, leading a long train of dudes lined up right behind him at mile two. he would continue to lead and continue to set himself apart from the rest of the field until the descent off 11,000-plus-foot lone peak after mile 10, where he rolled his ankle and was forced to walk off the mountain and call it a day. when dakota injured himself, it was the spaniardhassan ait chaou(post-race interview) who assumed the men’s lead. prior to that, hassan had been running strong in second place since before mile seven, on the descent from headwaters ridge, where he was hovering just under two minutes back of dakota. the gap between hassan and the rest of the field grew minute by minute as the race progressed, as such that when he crossed the line the men’s winner, there wasn’t another guy in sight for some128 minutes–a relative eternity at this race distance. hassan ait chaou, 2016 the rut 28k champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell bulgaria’skiril nikolovappeared to take the early race easy while moving up in the race’s second half. at mile two and mile seven, respectively, kiril ran in sixth and eighth positions. in just two miles, however, on some more runnable terrain between miles seven and nine, kiril surged and moved into fourth position as he started the big climb to lone peak. he gave up a couple positions on that rocky uphill, but took them and more back on the descent afterward. at the mile 14.5 aid station, kiril ran in second, a position he’d hold to the finish. kiril nikolov running toward second place at mile 10. photo: irunfar/bryon powell catalanjan margarit soléis a relatively new name on the mountain-running scene. he started the race off casually, much like kiril, running in the back half of the men’s top 10 for the early miles, arriving to the base of the big lone peak ascent at mile nine in fifth place. he killed the ascent and, in doing so, launched himself into podium position. after going over the top in third, he lost a position to eventual second-place finisher kiril, but gained a spot when he went past the ailing dakota. ultimately, he crossed the line in third. jan margarit solé, 2016 the rut 28k third place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. thank you to sarah bard, corrine malcolm, chris klinghagen, ryan lundin, jessica torgerson-lundin, lisa verwys, denise ricks and family, doug cassaro, taryn graham, ali albayrak, and seth swanson for their field assistance in covering the race! related articles:"
"france’sludovic pommeret(post-race interview) andcaroline chaverot(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) emerged as victors from a truly dramatic 2016utmb. the women’s race was characterized by two women pressuring each other off the front and steady-as-she-goes forward progress by the rest of the top female finishers. the men’s race story was ultimately shaped by the guys who best navigated multiple levels of racing carnage. in addition to this article, you can find our full play-by-play of the race as well as a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on ourutmb live-coverage page. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to utmb-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back! special thanks toaltrafor making our live race coverage possible. thanks also togufor sponsoring our coverage. ps. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. the start of the 2016 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell let’s face it, we’re all a little speechless about what went down on that large loop around mont blanc this weekend. as our volunteers were staffed at more than a dozen places around the course, what we saw was a race that ran like an onion. layer after layer peeled off as the kilometers clicked by, each new layer a seeming brand-new race. the men’s utmb race is these days becoming one of significant attrition and a race where success is largely defined by smart racing and avoiding becoming a statistic. this year was no different. the reason for this year’s attrition must in be in large part due to the weather–the extra heat and humidity–as the men’s early pace was actually a bit more controlled as compared to previous years, slower than record pace for the race’s first third. in the end, it was a race which in some ways broke all the rules and in other ways abided by them. in the end, i still find the whole thing a bit inexplicable. the men’s top five from utmb 2016 (from left-to-right): 5. javi dominguez, 2. gediminas grinius, 1. ludovic pommeret, 4. david laney, 3. tim tollefson. photo: irunfar/bryon powell for 124 kilometers, americanzach miller(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) led the race. he did so in the same zach fashion we’ve seen him race 20k’s 50k’s, 50 milers, and 110k’s–unabashed rabbiting, the kid never looks back. his lead vascillated at times in that he occasionally shared it with others while at others he was quite a distance off the front. in the race’s middle third, however, his lead kept growing such that at grand col ferret (102 kilometers) he had 26 minutes over the rest of the field. but his race quickly nose dived, not unlike the steep descent off the col. in the span of 22 kilometers, zach bonked hard and gave up all 26 minutes of his lead, leaving champex-lac (124km) in second and a few seconds off the lead. he held pace with the leaders as long as it seems he could, but eventually his pace lapsed and he would go on to finish in a still-strong sixth place."
"it’s often said that high risk brings either high reward or high failure, and i’d still firmly stick his performance in the reward category. zach finished sixth place in the world’s most competitive 100 miler for his first shot at the distance. at the finish, zach’s eyes betrayed both deep fatigue and a deep hunger for more–i can’t help but think he’ll be back. how frenchmanludovic pommeret’srace played out was something of a marvel. ludovic started out by running at the front of the men’s race. at a half marathon into the race, he shared the lead with zach andfabien antolinos, who would dnf late in the race. but on the climb to the race’s marathon mark at col du bonhomme, ludovic tanked, and fell back to 50th place. he suffered a low patch due to stomach problems that, as he said at the finish line, made him thinking about dropping more than once. he slowly crept back up into the top 10, but it took some 50 kilometers to do so. even then, his battle was seemingly just beginning because he was still some 44 minutes off the lead. at champex-lac (124km), where most runners showed the effects of the terrain they’d already covered, ludovic looked fresh. the game was on, and it wasn’t long before he took over the lead, broke from those desperately trying to keep contact, and built a 26-minute cushion by the finish. it seems simply not possible to win a race as competitive as this one in this style–it breaks all the rules! but those who understand this sport well know that we may not ever fully understand it. in 100 miles, anything can and does happen. ludovic pommeret winning the 2016 utmb. photo: irunfar/bryon powell good grief, if i were a dude, i’m not sure i could stand the pressure of lithuania’sgediminas grinius(post-race interview) racing behind me. he has established his racing m.o. : conservative starts, rip-roaring finishes. and he’s one of the most internally focused racers i’ve seen, turned within and monitoring himself. gediminus raced outside of the men’s top 10 for about the race’s first third, right around 10th place for the next third, and then he just hammered the race’s last 50 kilometers. like ludovic, he was something of an apparition when he moved like a steam train through champex-lac (124km) in fourth place. twenty-five kilometers later, he’d passed the remaining carnage in front of him and made finishing second look like a walk in the park. when we saw him atop the last climb and descent at 160, 162, and 165 kilometers, he was simply floating. for a guy who races with such internal focus, he let it all loose at the finish, lifted a lithuanian flag, and expressed jubilance. gediminas grinius taking second at utmb 2016. photo: irunfar/bryon powell americantim tollefson(post-race interview) debuted at 100 miles this weekend and he made doing so look really fun."
"i’m not going to lie, i was a little nervous for the guy when i saw him run through saint-gervais, the race’s half-marathon point, in something like 40th place. i expected him to take things out a little harder, and i wondered if he was feeling off. at the race’s marathon point, he was hovering just outside the men’s top 10, a situation he maintained until after the 100-kilometer mark, where he moved into the men’s top 10. for a guy who has never raced this distance, he exhibited remarkable patience and poise. from an outside perspective, it looked like tim spent about 50 kilometers of the race’s second half lying in wait–waiting for carnage to come back. getting onto the podium at utmb is a bucket-list item for a lot of fast trail-ultra folks, but doing so for tim involved passing his friend and teammate zach miller late in the race. these guys had made it pretty clear pre-race, though, that even if they are friends, the game would be on during the race. on the race’s final climb, tim climbed into third place, where he would finish. and then he seemingly threw away all the patience he previously possessed, and went on like a man possessed, hunting gediminas in second place and trying to stay in front of a chasing david laney in fourth. tim tollefson striding into la fouly (110km). photo: irunfar/bryon powell in taking fourth, americandavid laney(pre-race interview) put to bed anyone’s wonderings about whether the guy was a one-hit wonder here at utmb. i felt the same way about david as i did tim in the race’s early miles, a little nervous to see him running in 40th-some-odd place. as the race went on, however, i realized that david (and tim for that matter) was actually running faster relative to the very front of field this year. it was actually that the men’s field was much more deep–there were more dudes than ever running within an hour of the lead at 100 kilometers. at 100 kilometers, david was in closer contact with the lead this year, it’s just that he passed much more carnage to get to the front. his late-race pushing is so fun to watch as a spectator, and it must be terrifying for the runners around him. you could see at the finish that he was spent, having given his fourth-place finish his all. spain’sjavi dominguezwas the men’s fifth-place finisher, and i’m not a bit surprised to see him there. his race results of late have been strong, so i expected him to contend for the men’s top 10, and i anticipated him doing so with the conservative-start/fast-finish style we saw him use to take third here three years ago. seventh place was france’ssébastien camus, who appeared to have several highs and lows, which would propel him in and out of the men’s top 10 throughout the race. he ultimately finished looking strong.julien chorier, who ran among podium position through 130 kilometers, slowed at the end to eighth."

"a strong runner over long and technical races, utmb is really the perfect scene for her. turns out, uxue’s stomach went bad at about 70 kilometers into the race, and she subsequently struggled with nutrition and energy levels. sometimes, as a race observer, you just feel bad for runners, and i sympathized with uxue’s sufferfest–nothing came easy for her. i find it notable, however, that on a day where uxue felt bad for 120 kilometers, she still finished a solid third place at the prestigious utmb. goodness, if she can run third here on a rough day, i’d sure like to see what she could do at a race like this on a perfect-for-uxue day. uxue fraile enjoying saturday’s sunrise. photo: irunfar/bryon powell france’sjuliette blanchet, the u.s.’smagda boulet, and the u.k.’sjasmin paris(post-race interview) took fourth, fifth, and sixth places, respectively. at 92 kilometers into the race, at refuge bonatti, this trio ran into these positions, and would mostly stay in them for some 80 kilometers more to the finish. there was some late-race drama, however, between magda and jasmin when jasmin caught magda on the descent to vallorcine (151km) and magda was forced to hammer the final climb. and hammer she did, putting about 15 minutes on jasmin, a gap she would maintain to the finish. magda boulet staying calm and collected in la fouly (110km). photo: irunfar/bryon powell hungary’sildikó wermeschertook seventh, japan’skaori niwawas eighth, switzerland’sdenise zimmermannwas ninth, and the u.k.’ssophie grant10th.

"kilian jornet at mile 18. photo: irunfar/sarah lavender smith full results. for the second-consecutive year,anna frostwon the women’s race. anna led from start to finish in a race where heat played a significant factor. by the time frost reached ouray at mile 44 and began the long ascent up the bear creek drainage toward engineer pass at mile 52, which she was “absolutely boiling” and had to slow down her pace to a walk, she had a 26-minute lead overemma roca(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) which would extend to 41 minutes by maggie gulch at mile 85. anna maintained her composure and went on to run a clockwise time of 29:02:09 and eighth-place overall. frost found this race much harder than her 2015 win both mentally and physically despite not being pushed in the same way by second place. this year’s clockwise-course direction, with its long and runnable downhills, didn’t play to her strengths. her favorite part of the course was going over its high point, handies peak, at night with the the bright moon, stars, and coyotes howling. anna frost climbing oscar’s pass early in the race. photo: irunfar/mad moose events roca ran her own race for a very solid second-place finish. emma ran in third until chapman gulch (mile 18) where she overtookbethany lewis(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who took the race out hard. roca looked controlled throughout the race, but she also looked affected by the heat in places. that said, she moved through aid stations quickly and with determination, and she never let the gap between she and frost extend beyond 40 minutes. at grouse gulch (mile 58), she commented about the beauty of the course. at the finish with her family, which had crewed her through the day, night, and day again, she was emotionally charged. emma roca finishing second with her family. photo: irunfar/tom caughlan lewis would eventually finish in third more than two and a half hours behind the winner as she suffered from leg cramps on the descent off grant swamp pass, only the second descent of the race. instead of chasing her own potential, she spent most of the race trying to minimize any further damage. icing her quadriceps in ouray, a longer break at sherman (mile 72), a lay-down rest at maggie gulch, and a lot of her own willpower are how she said she managed her way back to the finish line. fourth place was experienced hardrocker,darla askew, closely followed bymeghan hicksin fifth. bethany lewis running toward third place. photo: irunfar/sarah lavender smith full results. articles photo galleries race reports a sincere thank you to the massive group of people who helped make irunfar’s live coverage of hardrock possible over two days in some remote and rugged mountain terrain."

"into the top 10 about a third of the way through the race, into the top five by mile 85, and then the podium at mile 93.5. jeff now has a couple dozen 100-mile finishes and is a true master of the second halves of races. i think we’d all like to take that chapter from jeff’s 100-mile racing book. jeff browning crossing the american river. photo: irunfar/bryon powell france’sthomas lorblanchet(pre-race interview) came into this race wearing bib m5 and it seemed like almost every time we saw him today he was also in fifth place. look up the definition of ‘consistent’ in the dictionary and you’ll surely find thomas at western states. he’s a quiet, focused racer so it’s hard to get a read on how he’s feeling except for through how he’s moving. and his legs deceived neither us nor him today–he was surefooted from start to finish. rounding out the men’s top five was scottish speedsterpaul giblin. another established presence on the euro ultra scene, paul also has a penchant for occasionally training and racing in the u.s. paul looked strong early and late, but honestly a bit choppy in the race’s middle third. however, two out of three thirds ain’t bad and neither is fifth place at western states. jim walmsley created quite a stir for some 93.5 miles of racing wherein he led the race basically unchallenged and challenging the 14:46:44 course record set four years ago bytimothy olson. his effort seemed inhuman–and truly asking all of us observing at aid stations to plausibly reset the definitions of what is possible. none of us knew what to make of a guy who put himself 32 minutes ahead of the course record at the river crossing at mile 78. unfortunately, before mile 93.5, he took a wrong turn and went several miles off course before turning around, returning to the course, and basically walking it in. and never mind the incident at the river crossing before thatwherein he was briefly swept downstreamfrom the monitored crossing as he swum across the river. in the weeks before the race, it was said many times that jim was going to create fireworks with however his day turned out and that was never a truer statement. another race favorite,sage canaday(pre-race interview), took things out pretty hard. observing his run, he seemed somewhat torn by the dueling ideas that 100 miles is a long race and that jim was running quite strongly ahead of him. through the race’s middle third, sage, too, was ahead of record pace, but by fewer minutes. by the river, his stomach had stopped working. like jim, sage finished, but looked a bit worse for the wear when it was all over. likewise, the early third-place runnerdavid laney(pre-race interview) faded hard but finished. full results. andrew miller winning the 2016 western states 100. photo: irunfar/bryon powell kaci lickteig(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was a real sight to behold, light and airy in body posture and spirit from start to finish. it seems that this just was her year to win western states."
"with defending championmagda boulet(pre-race interview) quickly eliminated from the competition when she dropped with stomach issues at mile 16, kaci was the relatively unchallenged race leader all day. mile 16, mile 23, mile 30, mile 38, mile 47, mile 55, mile 62, mile 70, mile 78, mile 80, mile 85, mile 94, mile 97, mile 99, and the finish—get the picture?—these were all the places we saw kaci on course and we found her to be categorically smiles, hugs, happiness, and joy each of those times. we’ve seen her race here several times before, and those times we witnessed her working through clear low patches and difficulties. this race seemed different, however, with almost no blips on her radar. her seemingly seamless race certainly showed that stars do sometimes totally align for a single race, a single experience. kaci’s 17:57:59 is the fourth-fastest time on the course—only times run by women namedann trasonorellie greenwoodhave been faster. her finish also represents another marked improvement on her two previous finishes: a sixth in 20:07 in 2014 and second last year in 19:20. with such improvement each year, i don’t know that we’ve seen close to the extent of kaci’s potential here. kaci lickteig crossing the american river in the lead. photo: irunfar/bryon powell second-placeamy sproston(post-race interview), now here’s a person who is unpredicatable via observation. i seriously have no idea how amy is really feeling based upon how she looks. fortunately, if you ask her how she’s doing, she’s generally totally honest with wherever she’s at. though whether she’s feeling good or bad, she is always incredibly focused on the tasks at hand, and today was no exception. amy took it relatively easy before pushing later in the race, especially when she found herself pressured from behind by third place devon yanko. in the race’s final miles, devon temporarily closed the gap to amy, but this clearly spurred amy on and she, in turn, pushed and put a goodly number of minutes back on devon. at the finish, amy cited devon as part of her inspiration for her strong finish. with several finishes in this race and her highest previously having been third place and some 30-ish minutes slower, let’s just say that when this woman is on, it’s on. and today it was on. amy sproston cruising through robinson flat. photo: irunfar/bryon powell devon yanko(post-race interview) was the third woman. after looking chill early, i think she almost gave up on her race in the miles before dusty corners at mile 38 after missing her crew at an aid station, running out of supplies, and experiencing cramping. at mile 38, things seemed enough amiss that we wondered if she’d be able to recover and remain in the race. fortunately, she sussed out her issues by spending a bit of extra time at a couple aid stations, regrouping, and running the second half of the race with a smile on her face and some spring in her step."
"her podium finish is a living, breathing example of the fact that 100 miles is a long way, and there’s a lot of time for things to go both bad and good. devon yanko smiling her way through robinson flat. photo: irunfar/bryon powell amanda bashamwas one of my favorite performances in the women’s race. we’ve previously watched her race a couple times, at two the north face endurance challenge 50-mile championships races where she hovered on the cusp of top-10 women’s finishes. here, amanda spent the first part of the race hanging out in right about the same spot, just inside and outside of the women’s top 10. we saw her a few times in the race’s two thirds, and each time she was super chill, no fuss, and no pressure. after the halfway point at michigan bluff (mile 55.7), that’s when she crept into the top 10 and stayed there for good. from there, she slowly but steadily crept up on the rest of the field, picking off places until she full on lambasted the race’s final 10 miles or so. in this, her first 100-mile finish, as we understand it, she showed the world that she has the combination of street smarts and fitness to hang with the big guns at the 100-mile distance. canada’salissa st. laurentrounded out the women’s top five and brought a little international flare to the women’s race. at every aid station we visited, and though her position jumped around here and there, alissa was consistently within the top 10 and she consistently looked confident in her pace and position. her 20:27 fifth place improves upon her first finish here in 2014, where she finished 13th in 22:17. something tells me that there is a lot of potential remaining with alissa’s efforts at western states. alissa st laurent running through robinson flat. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. 2016 western states 100 champ kaci lickteig. photo: irunfar/bryon powell a huge team of volunteers and their selfless efforts brought you our western states 100 coverage. we sincerely thank mauri pagliacci and dani torres, who put in a miraculous 40 hours of office work bringing to you our live coverage of both lavaredo ultra trail and western states on back-to-back days. thank you to nick pedatella, ellie greenwood, travis liles, travis trampe, and alex nichols for volunteering to moderate our coveritlive discussion. on site at the race, we are grateful to the volunteer efforts of kim wrinkle, andy jones-wilkins, sarah and adam bradham, betsy hartley, scott yates, stephanie howe, michelle forshner, alisa chang, katy gifford, tina frizner, and leah cox. it takes a village! related articles:"

"this weekend, in rainy and cool conditions and on the hills above california’s lake sonoma,jim walmsley(post-race interview) andyiou wang(post-race interview) championed the 2016lake sonoma 50 mile. and, fourwestern states 100golden tickets were awarded to top female and male finishers. in this article, we have the full stories on how the men’s and women’s races played out. in addition to this article, you can find our a collection of our pre-race interviews and previews on our 2016 lake sonomalive-coverage page. as usual, we’ll be updating this article with additional results as well as links to race-related articles, photo galleries, and race reports. check back. to get all the latest ultra news from irunfar.com,subscribe via rssoremail. thank you so much tonathanfor their generous support of our coverage of this year’s lake sonoma 50 mile. thanks also tojulbofor making our coverage of lake sonoma possible. there’s a certain set of people in the trail-ultrarunning scene who call races like this one ‘track meets.’ long races, sure, but ones where leg speed becomes one of the major deciding factors as to who is going to win a race because of runnable terrain. it’s true that, each year, the lake sonoma men’s race may, indeed, come resemble a track meet a little bit more. that said, given the inherent leg speed of a half dozen dudes on the start line, this year’s men’s race went out certifiably chill. mario mendozacruised the 2.4 miles of hilly roads that start lake sonoma off ahead of the main men’s pack, but he was sucked back into the group after they hit singletrack. at the mile 11.6 warm springs creek crossing, it wasjim walmsley(post-race interview) who had broken off the front of the group by a half minute and taken a lead he’d never relinquish. even so, his pace was minutes more tempered this year than in 2015 when he crossed this creek on his way to fifth place. in what felt like a strange turn of events for lake sonoma–a race where a new course record has been set in the men’s race every single year of its existence–jim and the rest of the boys ran a pace that seemed, ahem… slow? yeah, but slow it wasn’t. the better descriptor is perhaps ‘controlled.’ the miles clicked on, and jim increased his lead over the group: 30 seconds at mile 11.6, two minutes at mile 16.9, five minutes at mile 25.2, and on up to 17-some-odd minutes at the finish where he set a new course record by about 8.5 minutes. running in a category of his own this weekend, jim is proving himself a force to be contended with right now. for those keeping track, jim already had a golden ticket from winning january’sbandera 100k, so his ticket rolls down the men’s podium. jim walmsley, 2016 lake sonoma 50 mile champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks and then there was some guy chasing the lead,tim freriks(post-race interview). who’s he? a standout high school and collegiate track and cross-country runner and a friend of jim’s who decided to give ultrarunning a go."
"it was hard not to be intrigued by story of a guy running boldy in what i was sure was his first ultra. and, it’s hard not to be intrigued by the fact that he ran 50 miles just fine–in fact, better than fine–took second, and earned a western states 100 golden ticket. together tim and eventual fourth-place finisherdylan bowmanran for some miles, coming through miles 16.9 and 19.5 pretty close together before tim broke away from dylan around the halfway point and maintained his second position all the way back around the lake. as to whether or not tim will take that golden ticket? as of this publishing, he’s not yet decided. tim freriks 30 miles into his first ultra and on his way to second place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks i thinkmario mendoza(post-race interview) is a guy who could kick the pants off a course like lake sonoma, if he can get all the variables to line up right on race day. in this year’s edition, mario ran the early miles of the race along with the main men’s lead pack before assuming around fourth to fifth position for a good chunk of the race. at mile 38, for example, mario was in fourth and a full three minutes off of third. however, by mile 45.5, mario had passed dylan and put a minute on him, moving himself into third place. as we learned post-race, that pair’s battle wasn’t over there, though. dylan would surge and pass mario once in the final miles before mario kicked, passed dylan back, and nabbed the last podium spot and the second golden ticket. do we know if mario will race western states? i don’t think he’s an official yes yet, but he sounded eager about it on the finish line. mario mendoza headed toward third place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks dylan ultimately captured fourth position,dan metzgerfifth,matt flahertysixth, andben kossseventh.karl meltzerfinished eight place, which was his third lake sonoma finish and his fastest by four-odd minutes.jeremy wolfcontinues to string together strong finishes with his ninth place, andzach bitterrounded out the top 10. similar tothe north face endurance challenge 50-mile championshipslast december, we didn’t see much carnage in the men’s race. most of the dudes who were in or very near the top 10 at 20 miles in were the same guys in or near the top 10 at the finish. i can’t help but wonder if we’re starting to see a new trend in trail ultrarunning? also, i can’t help but note walmsley’s pacing strategy–slower than record pace early, hover at record pace midway, and close a bunch faster–in contrast to thezach millerpacing strategy–all out all the way. pairing these two fellas’ and their approaches in a single race would make for some entertaining running right about now. full results. for all the energy conversation present in the early men’s race, there was none of that at the very front of the women’s race.camille herron, a road runner who converted a year ago to road ultrarunning with great success, made her trail-ultra debut here at sonoma."
"she went out hard, real hard. in fact, she was not far back from the lead men at mile 2.4 and still less than a half-dozen minutes behind at mile 11.6. no other woman bit on chasing camille, however, and the rest of the women’s lead pack bunched up mostly together and worked the south side of lake sonoma in the early miles. camille’s pace was ultimately unsustainable, however. after building up a lead on the other women through about mile 20, she gave that time back in the next 10 miles, lost the lead, kept going, and ultimately finished fourth looking real rough before beer and a seat at the finish line quickly revived her. yiou wang(post-race interview), a norcal standout runner in shorter-distance trail racing, served as camille’s closest chaser, but not aggressively so. at mile 11.6, for example, she was some six minutes behind camille and running basically at course-record pace, but she was already emerging from the rest of the top women as the gal to beat as she was 1.5 minutes up on everyone else. while yiou never built a huge lead on the passel of fast ladies behind her, she stayed steady and a couple minutes ahead of them all the way. between miles 25 and 30, she assumed the lead position, held it through the finish, and came over the line beaming with joy. i suspect this victory is only beginning a long string of success for yiou. yiou was offered a western states golden ticket with her win, and she said she’d think about it for a little while. yiou wang, 2016 lake sonoma 50 mile champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks kaci lickteig(post-race interview) ran a smart and spirited race from start to finish, and you’d never guess that she’d only had five weeks of training following a winter bout with injury ahead of this race. early, she ran among the main pack of women who would stay closely bunched for most of the race’s first half before stringing out into podium position. when we saw her on a hill at mile 30, she was almost skipping up the darn thing and only five minutes off leader yiou. fans watching couldn’t help but wonder if she’d come out this race the victor. we’d see her two more times before the finish, at miles 38 and 45.5, and she was almost identically attitude-ed. between miles 30 and 38, she assumed second position, but she never dug into the three- to four-minute lead yiou had on her. she crossed the finish looking absolutely elated with second place. kaci’s already got entrance to western states via her second place there in 2015, so her golden ticket rolls down. kaci lickteig says hi to her family at mile 19.5. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks anna mae flynn(post-race interview) was this weekend’s surprise fast female finisher, in her first 50 miler and on flatter terrain than she’d previously raced in her less-than-a-year career in trail ultrarunning."
"for the race’s first half, anna mae sat right there among the main group of top women, which ran together for some miles before very gradually spreading out a little, in fifth position each time we saw her until mile 30, where she’d moved up to fourth. she would hold fourth until the race’s final mile, when on the rocky uphill to the finish she came upon a suffering camille. anna mae passed, ran home to the final podium spot, and earned a western states golden ticket. she, too, is still undecided as of this publishing whether she would take it, but she was leaning toward accepting. anna mae flynn working the hill at mile 30. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks camille finished in fourth,emily petersonfifth,julia stamps-mallonsixth,kerrie wladseventh,christina clarkeighth,alicia hudelsonninth, andjennifer pfeifer10th. full results. our lake sonoma coverage was brought to you by a team of volunteers including mauri pagliacci, jon murchison, sandra campos, and julia millon. thank you so much! related articles:"

"just beyond the finish, competitors from the first wave of runners screamed as they crossed the finish and posed in front of the live webcam with arms raised, hitting their hearts with their hands and blowing kisses at the camera. less than an hour after the finish, martinez expressed concerns that a checkpoint stop had delayed his race. he finished sixth overall with a time of 3:39.20, and five minutes were deducted from his finish time to make up for the time lost on the course, which will not change his overall standing. natalia sedykhfinished in a time of approximately3:45and sprinted through the finish line shouting, “yes! yes!” “it was a very fun race, a dangerous race, but i am alive,” she said. “i am happy.” natalia sedykh winning stage 5 and the 2016 marathon des sables. photo: cimbaly mds 2016 nathalie mauclairfinished some 22minutes laterinsecondthird place.wyan chowstarted in the early wave today, ran incredibly well, and ran the second-fastest time for the women in stage 5. nathalie mauclair taking second in the 2016 marathon des sables. photo: cimbaly mds 2016 americanjason schlarbfinished the final stage of his mds debut fifth and will move up in the standings.

"an amazing part of rachid’s story that we can’t forget is his 2012 race, where he broke his femur during stage 4 while leading the race, was medivac-ed out of the race’s remote location, and underwent major surgery. to return from that sort of major injury and enter back into competitive dominance as he has makes rachid’s a double cinderella story. another competitive note on the women’s race,natalia sedykhandnathalie mauclairput on quite a show over the course of the race and showed what’s possible for women at the mds. that said, they were just two members of a highly competitive women’s field, more competitive than any other mds edition, i’d have to venture a guess. in true mds style, the unique and difficult racing and living conditions roughed up some of the race favorites, taking them out of contention by the end of the week. but also in true mds style, a few new faces emerged from the fray, women who managed to sort through those challenges and come out of them a bit faster than their competition. a new day dawns on women’s mds competition with the 2016 edition. in addtion to what natalia and nathalie did at the front of the race in terms of pushing boundaries, moroccanaziza rajiwas her own sort of boundary pusher thisweek. though this is changing, moroccan social norms for women don’t generally include sports except in minority situations, and the mds has seen only a handful of moroccan women participate in the race’s 31-year history. with aziza’s fifth place, she’ll certainly return to the rest of her life a role model for her female countrymates. men’s stage 5 results full stage and overall results. women’s stage 5 results note:pui yan “wyan” chow of china was originally listed as placing second in 3:50:23 based on provisional results. her time was later updated to 6:50:23. similarly, fernanda maciel of spain was originally awarded a time of 4:43:00 and fifth place on the stage. fernanda was given a two-hour penalty and an updated stage time of 6:43:00. full stage and overall results. men’s overall standings through stage 5 (the race’s finish) full stage and overall results. rachid el morabity winning stage 5 and the overall 2016 marathon des sables. photo: cimbaly mds 2016 women’s overall standings through stage 5 (the race’s finish) note: pui yan “wyan” chow of china has a provisional time of 33:18:42, which placed her 8th in the final rankings. she later had 3 hours added to her stage 5 time, which dropped her to 12th. full stage and overall results. 2016 mds women’s champ nathalie sedykh. photo: cimbaly mds 2016 additional information stage 5 route information at a true marathon’s distance, 42.2 kilometers, stage 5 was a runner’s route."
"while the course interspersed with sand dunes here and there, a jebel, and a couple other pace-sucking elements, this year’s stage 5 marathon course appears to have followed suit with mds tradition: a perfect marathon and ‘easy,’ runnable terrain–at least in the context of the sahara desert and what runners have seen over the course of the week. stage 5 map. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. stage 5 route description from the race’s official roadbook. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. stage 4 results men full stage and overall results. women full stage and overall results. overall standings through stage 4 men full stage and overall results. women full stage and overall results. stage 4 field report from irunfar correspondent [editor’s note:the field reports in this article have been written by irunfar field correspondentjacqueline kantor.] update april 14 10 am us mountain time: runners continued to trail in throughout the early morning of the fifth day in the desert, thursday, as top finishers, who had made their way back after sunset last night, enjoyed a day off before the marathon stage. there’s a 35-hour time limit on the 84.3-kilometer long stage, which ends on thursday evening. the men’s race is poised to turn out with the same top two finishers as 2015, andrachid el morabityshould take another title unlessabdelkader el mouaziz, who trails by four minutes and 26 seconds, is able to push past his younger teammate. rachid el morabity running into the sunset and his win of stage 4. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 after each finish,jose manuel ‘chema’ martinezrepeatedly talks of how he cannot catch the moroccan leaders, but he can get close. during the fourth stage, he led moroccanaziz el akadby nearly 20 minutes at one point; by the end, el akad was just two minutes and nine seconds behind. seven minutes and 30 seconds now separate chema and el akad in third and fourth place overall. el akad said he turned up his speed at checkpoint 6 after running with a slower rhythm through the beginning of the race. multiple runners said the heat was worse for the fourth stage than previous days, and the moroccan athletes guessed it reached above 110 degrees fahrenheit during the middle of the day. “it is important that the team is first,” el morabity said from his corner of the tent after el akad explained his race day. “and it is important that aziz is third.” fernanda macielis more than two hours down from leadernatalia sedykhin the overall rankings, but pushed ahead ofelisabet barnesandaziza rajiafter the 21st kilometer to secure a solid third overall ranking. she was dehydrated and struggled through the first part of the race, she said. the flat, lighter sand part of the course was ideal for her speed, and she reached that section of the trail by sunset."

"as forrachid el morabityandabdelkader el mouazizat the front of the race, it’s looking like a repeat of last year, like our field reporter said. rachid is just steady, steady, steady, and he always seems to have ample gas in the tank to turn it up and run like heck in the final kilometers of every stage. methinks this part of the competition is already set and rachid’s going to bring home his fourth mds title. not bad for a young guy born into socioeconomic challenge at the edge of the sahara desert, right? holy smokes, whatnathalie mauclairdid yesterday for the long stage is categorically off the charts for a woman at mds or a woman at any race. she finished a few minutes less than an hour back of the moroccan winners, in a 52-mile race that look the men a little over eight hours to finish. compare that disparity to other 50-mile races around the world of that time length and difficulty, and you’d expect to see about a 75- to 80-minute deficit between top elite men and women. talk about expanding the vision of what women can do. though nathalie won the long stage, she still has a 23-minute overall gap to leadernatalia sedykh. that’s a really difficult amount of time to surmount in the final marathon-distance stage 5, closing in on a minute-per-mile difference. of course, funnier things have happened in a race of this magnitude where there are so many more variables at hand besides just running, so we shall see. of note, natalia sits in 11th place overall in the rankings, and nathalie 13th. nathalia is 16.5 minutes behind the 10th place male overall, another difficult-to-surmount gap. sure would be cool to see a woman inside the top-10 overall at a race like this one, though. it’s fascinating to see that the men’s top 10 and women’s top 10 seem to be about set for the race once we get out of the top-two women and top-four men. it would take someone getting injured or having a big blow-up for positions to change much at this point. so, focused, smart, and conservative running for those women and men for one more marathon! stage 4 route information here it is, the mds long stage for 2016. unusual format, a route that loops back upon itself again. stage 4’s course has everything in it, tons of sandy terrain via small dune fields and dried creek beds, a couple rocky jebels or hills, dried-up lake beds, and other flat and more gentle terrain. it’s a fascinating course, which visits quintessential mds locations, like the little gorge of el maharch, and heads into terrain not typically visited by this race. at 84.3 kilometers in length, today is a real tough one, no matter the terrain. of note, the mds race admin starts the top-50 men and top-five women three hours after the rest of the field starts. stage 3 results top american 11. jason schlarb (usa) — 3:47.19 full stage and overall results."

"campagnie mds 2016 more gaps closed in the women’s race leading up to the long stage, and mauclair was able to getwithin four minutesof sedykh today after finishing about 14 minutes behind yesterday and 17 minutes behind on the first day. maciel, who finished 21 minutes ahead of raji, struggled at the beginning, but got into her rhythm at about the 15-kilometer mark. the heat is a non-issue for the rio de janeiro native, but the lack of incline is challenging. the ascent of foum al opath, a jebel or rocky hill, at about 17 kilometers was a welcome incline for her. “it was flat, and it was hard because i ran all the way—i am from the mountains, where you run and walk as you go,” she said. “i’m learning how to move on the dunes, so now i can climb better.” “when i see rocks, any sort of little climb, i think to my self, ‘yes! !’” maciel is easily the least experienced in mds terrain of the top-five females. barnes and sedykh are repeat competitors, raji is from ouarzazate and had easy access to sahara training, and, while it’s mauclair’s first mds, she trained in the sahara for one week over the winter. each day, maciel feels less like she’s racing to win, and more like she’s racing to finish. “i give all my energy, all day, 200 percent, because i feel confident that i can recover during the night,” she said. runners cross a jebel, or rocky hill, during stage 3. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 liza howard, the top american female, dropped down to sixth among the women, so she will start with the rest of the field at8:15 a.m.during the long stage. the first half of stage 3 was fine for her, but in the second, the heat hit in full force and derailed her physically. she scaled back to keep herself healthy. missing the cutoff for a late start is ideal, she said, to avoid the heat of the day. jason schlarb, the top american male, is at 12th overall after an 11th-place finish in the third stage. defending champelisabet barnescame in at fifth and about 11 minutes behind raji. she is now at fourth overall and about 55 minutes behind maciel’s third place. stage 3 competition analysis [editor’s note:the competition analyses in this article have been written by irunfar senior editormeghan hicks, who is not racing mds this year but who has finished the mds five times.] after a couple days of shake-ups around the men’s top five to top 10, it seems like today was a more chill round for the boys. that said, tomorrow brings the long stage, something in the vicinity of 80 kilometers, and what that means is shake-ups abound.rachid el morabityandabdelkader el mouazizsit firmly at the top of the overall rankings going into tomorrow’s long stage. the pair goes into the long stage with a 45-minute lead on the rest of the field, so steady, non-risky running tomorrow will surely keep them atop the rankings."
"as for the duel between the two, rachid holds just an 82-second lead over abdelkader. i’m not 100% convinced that these guys are actually competing against each other per se, as opposed to working together to set themselves apart from the rest of the field. that also said, if they are racing each other, there’s no one besides the moroccan ahansal brothers–neither of whom are racing this year–who can race the mds long stage like rachid. there’s definitely a fierce battle evolving for third position right now between spain’schema martinezand morocco’saziz el akad. aziz appears to have ran hard today to make up some of the deficit he had to chema in the overall standings, finishing today’s stage third and only 1.5 minutes back of the lead. chema enters the long day in third overall, but aziz is just about four minutes back. for me, this is the most exciting part of the men’s race at the moment. podium-ing in the mds is a huge deal for moroccan male athletes–a huge source of national pride. and since european and north american men so rarely make it to the men’s podium, i’m sure chema wants it real bad, too. the last time a non-sandy-country-dwelling person was on the mds podium was 2012 whenmichael wardiantook third in the overall rankings. tomorrow’s long-stage battle between chema and aziz is going to be good. as for the women’s race,natalia sedykhwon the stage again, but this time she was only four minutes ahead ofnathalie mauclair. lots of questions emerge here. did natalia slow down or did nathalie speed up? and if natalia slowed, did she do that intentionally ahead of tomorrow’s long stage or is she starting to feel the fatigue of running two days at unheard-of-for-a-woman-at-mds speeds? based on today’s results, it appears that natalia, indeed, ran slower relative to the men’s field today as compared to stages 1 and 2. and it also appears that nathalie didn’t speed up, but that she ran about the same pace relative to the men’s field today as the first two days. so we are left wondering the reason behind natalia’s slower pace today and what will happen tomorrow. after a slow start on stage 1,fernanda macielhas finished third woman in both stages 2 and 3, and only a couple minutes each day behind nathalie mauclair in second. it seems like she’s digging her heels in and figuring what this mds thing is all about. she’s a long-haul specialist, so i imagine she’s going to do just fine in tomorrow’s long stage. holyaziza raji, she finished fourth today! the little moroccan firecracker, i was told by my moroccan friends, has great potential in the mds, but that she needs some time to develop as an athlete. they said she will get stronger as the race goes on, and as the years go on. it seems they are predicting correctly. aziza now sits in fifth in the overall rankings, but she’s just 17 minutes back of defending champelisabet barnes."
"tomorrow’s race between this pair is going to be a great one to watch as well. it appears that elisabet barnes isn’t racing with the same fitness this year as in 2015. today she finished fifth and some 45 minutes back from the lead. in watching her race with such strength on her way to her win last year, i don’t expect to see any huge dips in her performance during tomorrow’s long stage. i predict steady-as-she-goes pace. the only question is if that pace will be enough to fend off aziza. liza howardappears to have had a rough day today, finishing 12th and 90 minutes off the lead. this puts her a full two hours out of podium contention going into the long stage. she’s now in sixth in the overall standings, and about 39 minutes out of the top five. again, big shake-ups happen during the long stage, so if liza can put together a big day tomorrow, i think she can nose her way back into the women’s top five. also interesting to her race is that the mds starts the top-five women (and top-50 men) three hours after the rest of the field. so liza and the women behind her in the rankings will race separately from the five front women and won’t know how they are stacking up until after the stage. three-time mds championlaurence klein(france) dropped from the race on stage 2. we don’t know the reason. stage 3 route information the mds’s course creators always go a little ‘easy’ with their design of stage 3 course, probably because the looooong stage 4 beckons and everyone could use an ‘easier’ day beforehand. today runners had flat, runnable terrain for most of the stage’s 37.5-kilometer distance, though they encountered several shorter dune fields, one small jebel (rocky hill), and likely some very sandy terrain at the edge of oued rheris. oued rheris is an mds mainstay: it’s a giant, sandy, dry wash, and one of the main drainages of this part of the sahara. it’s a really cool feature of the ecosystem especially because, while there isn’t water unless there’s been rain within a few days, you’ll often run past blooming flowers and trees, a sure sign of it being spring in the desert and a welcome sight after so many kilometers of starker terrain. that said, depending on the route you take through it, it can make for some super sandy running. stage 3 route map. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. the mds roadbook route instructions for stage 3. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. stage 2 results full stage and overall results. full stage and overall results. overall standings through stage 2 men full stage and overall results. women full stage and overall results. stage 2 field report from irunfar correspondent [editor’s note:the field reports in this article have been written by irunfar field correspondentjacqueline kantor.]"
"stage 2 sent the runners off with their packs to the punishing dunes that fatigued elites and led to more than 20 dropouts on the first day, and “another one bites the dust” aptly greeted the crowd for an8:30 a.m.start. the beginning of the course led through a sandy, stony flat stretch and onward to smaller, darker orange dunes covered with black stones.monday’s41.3-kilometer course featured smaller sand hills and stony terrain through wadis and two small villages, and minimal obstacles allowed for faster speeds. there was more running and less thinking, said several of the top finishers, but the increased pace exhausted more technical runners and allowed for the heat of the desert—close to 90 degrees fahrenheit by late afternoon—to fully set in. the start of stage 2. photo: cimbaly/v. compagnie mds 2016 defending champrachid el morabityagain took first, this time with a 26-second edge on teammateabdelkader el mouaziz, finishing at a 4:56/kilometer pace (7:57/mile). he averaged 5:36/kilometer (9:00/mile) through the sand and wind yesterday.el mouaziz entered checkpoint 1 first withabderrahmane moatacim,hammou moudouji, and el morabity close behind. morabity and el mouaziz had just about a minute on the closest runners behind until checkpoint 3 at 32.5 kilometers. they took advantage of the flat, sandy, and sparsely-vegetated final kilometers to gain close to a 20-minute advantage onaziz el akadandjose manuel chema martinez, who finished hand-in-hand. el morabity picked up his pace significantly toward the end because of the trailing competitors, he said, and having el akad and martinez on his tail provided extra motivation.tomorrow, he’ll look to conserve energy for the long stage on day 4. “this stage was not very difficult, it was very fast, and the wind made it a little complicated,” martinez said. “i’m very happy today. it’s difficult to beat the moroccans, but i am getting closer. they live here. they know the mountain, the sand. they have a control of the way. i try to stay with them. i was tired, but everyone is tired today.” runners likecarlos sa, who finished at the same time asjean-sebastien braun, found the speed of stage 2 challenging; others savored the opportunity to focus more on pace and less on navigation. “this was way better than yesterday,” saidsondre amdahl, who finished seventh. “yesterday i had problems with seeing ahead, today i could just concentrate on running. it was a good effort throughout.” jason schlarb and david hellard in stage 2’s small sand dunettes and camelgrass. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 natalia sedykhof russia, who made a spirited finish yesterday to take first place among women by 17 minutes, entered the bivouac today equally optimistic at 10th-place overall and first female. she finished 36 minutes behind el morabity and 14 minutes ahead of the second woman,nathalie mauclair.“it was perfect, just like a stadium,” said sedykh, who specializes in the 10k. last year, she ran her first half marathon in january, her first marathon in february, and her first marathon des sablestwo months later."
"she has a 2:46 marathon pr from last fall and has run 33:54 for 10,000m in 2011. she returned to the desert this year looking to right her rankings after a one-hour penalty knocked her to third place last year. “i believe in magic,” she said last night, after resting up in her tent with a crew of fellow russians. “i am very surprised to be first, but i am highly motivated from last year. i know it’s only the last finish line that matters. i’m just thinking about the next day, and then the next day after that.” mauclair came through the finish equally cheery after a “faster course than usual,” she said, and was followed byfernanda macielabouttwo minutes later. maciel’s prep for this race includes a record-breaking ascent of aconcagua, the highest mountain in south america, in february. the effort at altitude left maciel anemic, she said, and she’s feeling the strain after two days of desert. but the speed in stage 2 suited her better, she said, given her lack of experience with dune running. “today i enjoyed all the course,” she said. “i love the wind, because you feel fresh when it’s against you.” samir akhdarentered his eighth mds last year with a goal of finishing in the top five. he finished fourth, and entered this year’s aiming for the top-three spot claimed by el akad last year. he held tight with el akad and martinez until checkpoint 2 today, then fell off by 11 minutes by the finish. the next few stages, particularly the longest, are the most important, he said, and he’s hoping to gain the time back on the longest day. “i took my time and went slowly, but it was better than yesterday,” he said. yesterday’s second-place finisher, moroccanhammou moudouji,dropped down to 28th in stage 2 after doubling back to retrieve his water card. he realized he dropped it at about one kilometer past checkpoint 3, and ran back four kilometers before finding a runner who had retrieved it at checkpoint 2. continuing without the card would have resulted in an hour penalty, and at this stage in the race, retracing his steps was less risky than running onward. otherwise, the course was “very flat, very easy,” he said, and easier than yesterday besides the heat. moudouji specializes in the marathon and is making his first mds appearance. moudouji’s misstep andedgar parra tolero’sdrop down from the top 10 made room for americanjason schlarb, who finished 15th yesterday, to take 10th man and 11th overall today. defending champ elisabet barnes running stage 2. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 stage 2 competition analysis [editor’s note:the competition analyses in this article have been written by irunfar senior editormeghan hicks, who is not racing mds this year but who has finished the mds five times.]"
"holy smokes, not only is this year’s women’s race the most competitive we’ve yet seen at the mds, but it could also be the most interesting in the race’s 31-year history.natalia sedykhblew it out of the water again today, finishing 10th overall for stage 2. i don’t think a woman’s ever finished in the top 10 of an mds stage before, unless we’re talking in the race’s first couple years when it had very few entrants. she’s truly hauling. tomorrow should be fascinating. is she running sustainably for a week of racing? time will tell. nathalie mauclairran stronger today in second than she did yesterday, finishing about 14 minutes back from natalia in a longer stage as opposed to yesterday’s 17 minutes from the lead. and here comesfernanda maciel. after finishing out of contention of the lead yesterday, fernanda was third and about 16 minutes back today. with fernanda’s strong push today, she moved herself up into third position in the overall rankings. both nathalie and fernanda have proven themselves in long mountain endeavors, so how they fare in coming days will be fascinating, too. defending champelisabet barnesis now in fourth in the overall rankings. she finished a 30-minute deficit to the lead yesterday and a little over 41 minutes today, a longer stage. it seems like her pace is steady relative to the women’s lead through both of the first two stages, but that she’s running slower relative to the men this year than when she won last year. liza howardfinished stage 2 in fifth, and is now fifth in the overall standings, too. she gave 37 minutes to the lead yesterday and 47 minutes today. like elisabet, liza’s pace relative to the women’s lead seems pretty steady, and overall pretty close comparatively to her pace from last year relative to the top men. great stuff in the men’s race, too! we have a non-moroccan in the overall top three right now, spaniardchema martinez! however, he’s got moroccanssamir akhdarandaziz el akadbreathing down his back in the overall standings. there have been huge shake-ups in the top of the men’s race in just the first two days, and so there are sure to be more. one thing seems sure, though:rachid el morabityandabdelkader el mouazizhave clearly started putting on their clinic over the rest of the runners. the pair finished one-two and 19 minutes ahead of the rest of the field today, which puts rachid ahead of everyone else who isn’t abdelkader by a full 39 minutes in the overall rankings. this is a lot of time, many more minutes than we are used to seeing at just two stages into the mds in the race’s last decade or so. the question is, are those two putting in more of an effort in these first days to break from the field more strongly? or, is the pair running similar to the previous couple years with others in the field being unable to challenge as closely this year?"
"from the field we hear that the pair ran the last quarter of the race a lot faster than the rest of the field, so perhaps they were, indeed, trying to dig in a little lead over everyone else. stage 2 route information at just shy of a full marathon’s distance and so some seven kilometers longer than stage 1, stage 2 took the lead men about 15 minutes longer than yesterday, which means today’s course was significantly more runnable. much of the first two thirds of the course was flat, runnable terrain, from the starting line to the second water checkpoint at 34.5k. after that, it was a brief and rugged crossing of a jebel, or hill in arabic, to the finish line. stage 2 route map. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. the mds roadbook route instructions for stage 2. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. stage 1 results full stage and overall results. top american men:15. jason schlarb 3:42.3616. harvey lewis 3:42.39 full stage and overall results. stage 1 field report from irunfar correspondent [editor’s note:the field reports in this article have been written by irunfar field correspondentjacqueline kantor.] the difficult dune passages and strong headwinds in the first stage left even the most skilled local competitors struggling as they crossed the finish line afternoonsunday. about 30 minutes after defending champrachid el morabitycompleted the first stage, his teammateabderrahmane moatacimwalked slowly down the last dunes of erg znaigui and toward the second bivouac until teammateaziz el akadcaught up with him. akad grabbed his hand to lead him into a jog until the finish. the pair stepped off to the side quickly, and as akad helped his teammate pull off his pack for a moment of relief,natalia sedykhof russia sprinted through the finish line smiling and seemingly unfazed by the same course that had a left a local defeated. she was the 13th finisher overall, the first female, and the first runner to cross the finish line grinning. rachid el morabity won stage 1 by a few-second margin. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 “that was very nice,” she told the staff waiting by the finish line. “thank you for all the sand.” sedykh finished in an unofficial 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 20 seconds, and did not realize she was the first female finisher until an interview with the moroccan media. “i am happy but it is only the beginning,” she said, still grinning and bouncing on her feet. “we have a very difficult path ahead.” natalia sedykh was the runaway women’s stage 1 winner. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 the first stage began at9 a.m.with a light breeze and a direct path into the erg chebbi dunes for about 12 kilometers; it ended with three kilometers through the erg znaigui dunes and a fierce wind that drew directly into the runners’ path and picked up significantly about an hour after the first runners returned to the bivouac."
"the moroccan men swept the first three spots—el morabity,hammou moudouji(mds novice, road runner), andabdelkader el mouazizall finished within 35 seconds of each other. moatacim had rolled through the first checkpoint with the leaders, but fell back as the top three stayed tight together until the last few meters. the top three ran together up until the last meters. the men’s lead pack, led by rachid el morabity, worked the stage 1 sand dunes. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 “the wind creates problems,” el mouaziz said. “and it’s more difficult this year because there are others that are very strong, competitors from europe and america. it puts a little stress on us.” right after the finish, el morabity went straight to the counter where runners pick up post-run cups and slouched down with his head toward the table. el mouaziz, the captain of his team, grabbed him and moudouji into a huddle as the three recovered from their final sprint. by the timejose manuel ‘chema’ martinezof spain rolled in about nine minutes after the first trio, the wind had picked up, and the dunes just beyond the finish line were obscured by sand. nathalie mauclairwas the second woman and 17 minutes and 10 seconds behind sedykh, and found that the elements made tactical decisions in the sand trickier. “i always have to be looking to see where to place my feet for the dunes,” she said. “but it was difficult to see.” the course spit the runners out of the dunes right at checkpoint 1. they jogged past a lone muddy brown house and clubs of acacia trees before a dry wadi and flat, sandy stretch that looked deceivingly solid, said defending champelisabet barnes, who camein 13 minutesand 27 seconds behind mauclair. it reminded her of the soft sand of theoman desert marathon, and provided little relief after the dunes. “once we finally got to the flat ground, that’s when we got the tough headwinds,” she said. “it was a tough stage given the amount of sand.” “those sand dunes were mean,” saidharvey lewis, who finished at 16th and three seconds behind fellow americanjason schlarb. liza howardof the u.s. finished about sevenminutes after barnes in fourth placeand said the stage was tougher than any of the first three days in the 2015 edition; first-timermeghan arbogast(usa), who came in seventh, called it the “harshest environment i’ve ever run in.” “the wind was so relentless, and so loud,” she said. “i just jogged along and didn’t fight the wind. and if it’s like this every day, it’s going to be really tough.” stage 1 featured a 12-kilometer crossing of the erg chebbi, one of morocco’s largest dune fields. photo: cimbaly/v. campagnie mds 2016 stage 1 competition analysis [editor’s note:the competition analyses in this article have been written by irunfar senior editormeghan hicks, who is not racing mds this year but who has finished the mds five times.]"
"because the mds’s live-tracking system malfunctioned for stage 1, we don’t yet have access to splits and positions on top runners through each checkpoint today, so we won’t analyze the competition too much. however, a few notes become apparent with the data we’ve so far received from the field: stage 1 route information the 2016 mds stage 1 route began with three kilometers of flat running straight toward one of morocco’s largest and tallest field of dunes, the erg chebbi. then runners contended with a 12k crossing of that dune field. the field’s shifting sands with little to no navigational markers on the first day, when everyone’s packs are the heaviest, was surely the day’s greatest challenge for most. upon exiting the dunes, runners hit the first water checkpoint, and continued onto a relatively flat section lasting all the way to the second water checkpoint at 25.8k. this section surely saw the top runners hammering at some of the fastest speeds we’ll see them all week, though contending with the hidden obstacles and challenges always present in this part of the sahara desert. from there, it was variable terrain, some hills and another small set of sand dunes, until the finish, 34k from where it all started earlier in the day. stage 1 route map. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. the mds roadbook route instructions for stage 1. image courtesy of the marathon des sables. check-in day field report from irunfar correspondent all around the bivouac on the day before the start of the 2016 marathon des sables, competitors spent their first full day in the desert making last-minute adjustments and exploring the mds village that popped up in the sahara about eight miles from the village of merzouga. first-timers packed and repacked their bags nervously before parting with their less necessary belongings; elite runners talked of heat acclimation and quick trips to desolate trails in the last month. last-minute, pre-race race training ranged from 48 hours in death valley (badwaterchampharvey lewisof the u.s.) to four days on the beach in rio de janiero (fernanda macielof brazil) to two weeks in the sahara and in the middle atlas mountains of morocco (three-time winnerrachid el morabityand his moroccan team). el morabity’s crew of likely podium finishers—abdelkader el mouazis (second place in 2015),aziz el akad(third place in 2015) andabderrahmane moatacim(first-time mds competitor) — spent much of their time at erg chebbi, which will provide the starting terrain for tomorrow’s stage 1 of the 31st edition. the pink-orange dunes loomed in the background of the bivouac, providing a perfect photo op for runners to pose with their gear as well as an ominous sign of the 34 kilometers ahead. the first stage starts in the dunes, heads into the village of m’fis, and onward to mines, through variably hilly terrain and into a small gorge before ending just beyond the erg znaigui dunes."
"“i’m feeling all right, very relaxed,” el mouaziz said as he stood at the entrance of the circle of runner’s tents, greeting runners from last year and posing for photos with el morabity and foreign friends and fans. the moroccan men snagged the top-four spots last year, withsalameh al aqraof jordan in fifth andjose manuel ‘chema’ martinezof spain a spot behind. the best bets to challenge martinez as the top non-moroccan male could be one of three contenders joined together by team i run 4 hope. lewis,jason schlarb(usa), andcarlos sá(portugal) are all potential top-10 finishers and part of a team looking to raise awareness for children with adhd. lewis was able to fit some sand dunes into training with his brief trip to death valley—“but not as big as those,” he said, pointing to erg chebbi in the distance. “but i’m happy about it.” he ran 62 kilometersin 48 hoursduring that trip, and at home in cincinnati, ohio, he runs the 10 kilometers to and from work every day at a public-arts school with his backpack and the backpack of a student. cincinnati is hilly enough to offer some prep for this race, lewis said, and running in the snow is not the same as the thin sand of the sahara, but still offers a considerable challenge. lewis will turn 40 on the day of the longest stage of the race, and said all of his training and “chipping, chipping, chipping away” at personal goals has led to this point. “when i first started running, at 15, it took me five years to break a five-hour marathon,” he said. “it took me 17 years to qualify for theboston marathon. it took me 22 years to make the u.s. team, and it’s all led to this—the fastest i’ve been in my life will betomorrow.” schlarb, his tentmate and teammate, took two quick trips to the desert nearby his home of durango, colo., to get prepped. he’s drawn to cold-climate races but was convinced to compete after hearingdave mackey, the top american finisher in the 2015 edition, call it a “life experience.” “it’s unlike just showing up to a race. you hang out, you talk, you gain friendship, while having this challenge of carrying everything, and challenging the body and the mind.” the runners spent their last day before self-sufficiency lounging around in sleeping pads they would soon abandon, fastening country flags to the otherwise indistinguishable black tents in the runner’s village, and getting to know their tentmates that would greet them back at camp throughout the week. “this is unlike anything else,” saidliza howard, who was in podium contention last year before getting sick during the fourth stage. “there’s the racing and the running, and then the culture—this strange tent city that exists, away from communication, no phones, no kindles.” 2016 mds runners listen to the check-in day runner briefing. photo: irunfar/jacqueline kantor her tentmate and fellow top female contender,meghan arbogast, is making her first appearance at marathon des sables. she’s looking forward to the running, and dreading the cold at night."
"“this is a new experience,” she said. “a clean slate.” defending championelisabet barneshas returned to the race with a vastly different welcome than last year. in 2015, she was a relative unknown who had placed 15th in her first mds in 2012. this year, she’s getting used to the new attention from media and other runners, and coming off a “year of transition” marked by a hectic work and running schedule, in part due to her win last year. the draw of the mds is the ability to spend a week focusing on the basics—eat, sleep, run—and her defending title means that simplicity is somewhat complicated already. “i’m going to run my own race,” she said of the competitive women’s field this year. “you can’t get drawn into what other people are doing, because it’s such an extreme environment. you have to race with your head.” related articles:"
"runners and spectators alike were treated to great conditions at transgrancanaria 2016. with an 11 p.m. start, runners faced 8 or 9 hours of cool temperatures with the occasional run through a cloud before a moderately warm day with some clouds and some breezes. these conditions along with a slightly shorter course, even if over more technical last 20 kilometers, made for some fast finishes at the front of the men’s and women’s field, including both winners–didrik hermansen(pre-andpost-raceinterviews) andcaroline chaverot(pre-andpost-raceinterviews). that said, there were plenty who didn’t fare so well over the relentless 125-kilometer course with more than 26,000′ (8,000m) of climbing. let’s see how things shook out. with as deep a field as transgrancanaria had on the men’s side, you expect a large pack to go out together and last at least until 30 kilometers. that more or less happened… except that france’saurélien colletwent off the front and stayed there… for a very long time. in fact, his early breakaway looked like it might hold as he had a two-to-four-minute lead for most of the race until… well, i’m getting ahead of myself. aurélien collet leading in tunte. photo: irunfar/bryon powell by the marathon mark, a chase group of four runners seemed to solidify:gediminas grinius(last year’s champ) (pre-andpost-raceinterviews),andy symonds,diego pazos, andpau capell. plenty of top talent, includingyan long-fei,jonas buud, didrik hermansen, andjulien chorier, chased within 12 minutes of the lead. long-fei would drop soon after with an ankle injury. grinius continued to lead the chase pack with symonds, pazos, and capell bouncing around behind him. hermansen and buud had been running together, but hermansen pulled away from swede and started making up ground on the chase pack. he caught symonds not long after mid-race as the brit suffered from cramping. gediminas grinius running in third at tunte. photo: irunfar/bryon powell at the head of the race, collet still led at tunte (94km), but he looked worked. only three minutes back was norway’s hermansen. as i wrote at the time, hermansen was “leading from behind.” there was no doubt that he would catch the frenchman. his only likely remaining challenger for the win would be the lithuanian, grinius, who appeared to be battling… looking strong, but not without strain. hermansen, on the other hand, looked fluid and at ease. however, both men later recounted passing one another multiple times with didrik having the advantage on the descents and gediminas on the climbs. diego pazos and pau capell rather through tunte together, as they would for the rest of the race. two thirds of the way into the race and you start to see the cream rise to the top with the likes of symonds, buud, and chorier running in sixth through eighth. diego pazos and pau capell running together in tunte. photo: irunfar/bryon powell moving ahead to ayagaures, 107 kilometers into the race and we saw the first lead change. having moved up from running in the teens early on, hermansen had the lead with grinius only two minutes back."
"collet now ran in third, but had given up 8 minutes in 14 kilometers… his race would get uglier from there. with capell and pazos 18 minutes in arrears in ayagaures, it was a two man race. didrik hermansen wins transgrancanaria 2016. photo: irunfar/bryon powell as he’d been doing so for some time, hermansen continued to outrun gediminas on the descents that dominated the race’s final 18 kilometers (although he felt pressure on the 3-kilometer climb out of ayagaures) and won in 13:41, four minutes ahead of grinius. compressport teammates capell and pazos moved up a spot to tie for third. andy symonds managed to control his cramps to end up in fifth. the biggest surprise in the top ten was lithuania’svaidas zlabys, who took eighth, a marked improvement over his 36th-place finish at last year’s transgrancanaria. while long-time leader collet imploded after ayagaures, he did walk it in to finish in 19th. vaidas zlabys (left) with countryman gediminas grinius. photo: irunfar/bryon powell 2016 transgrancanaria men’s results on the women’s side, it was quite simply the caroline chaverot show. throughout the race she put more or less one minute per kilometer on the next closest women. early in the race that included two-time defending champnúria picas(pre-race interview), but she retired with an injury at artenara, 34 kilometers into the race. after that, chaverot looked untouchable. she always looked as strong or stronger than the ladies behind her and she continued to build her massive lead en route to a two-hour win. it was domination, pure and simple. caroline chaverot leading in fontanales. photo: irunfar/bryon powell behind chaverot, ran switzerland’sandrea huser(post-race interview) and basque runneruxue fraile(post-race interview). the two actually ran together for a decent stretch, as the two have done in other races, before the swiss woman opened a small lead that she’d hold until the finish. fraile overcame a pre-race lack of confidence, based on a less-than-stellar run at tgc two years ago when it was her longest race to date, to take third. uxue fraile and andrea huser together in fontanales. photo: irunfar/bryon powell althoughsilvia triguerosmanaged to put a scare into fraile mid-race, she would finish more than an hour back… and just ahead of four other women who would finish within 15 minutes of her. perhaps the biggest surprise in the top ten was argentina’sadrianna vargas’sfifth place finish with a very consistent race. her previous international highlights included a 14th at transvulcania in 2014 and finishing between 25th and 25th at the two most recent iau trail world championships. notably, last year’s third-place womandong lirefused to drop out and finished ninth. silvia trigueros runs through tejeda in fourth. photo: irunfar/bryon powell 2016 transgrancanaria women’s results adriana vargas after taking fifth at transgrancanaria 2016. photo: irunfar/bryon powell call for comments thanks to ian campbell, miguelito rodriguez, and alfonso garcía clemente for helping with our live coverage on gran canaria and for mauri pagliacci and daní torres assisting with the live coverage and making our@irunfarescoverage possible. related articles:"

"first of all, congratulations to all of you chosen for the 2016hardrock hundred endurance run. with this year’s race proceeding in the perceived-to-be faster, clockwise direction, lottery entrants were up to 1,549 over last year’s lottery which had 1,367 applicants. all of these tickets (6,587 total) for 152 coveted slots for the privilege of running, hiking, and being supported on one of the most beautiful mountain courses in the world. prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants in divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. the divisions are ‘first-timers’ from which 47 spots in the run were given, ‘veterans’ from which 35 spaces were given, and ‘everyone else’ from which 70 spaces were given. even though this event is called a run and not a race, the front end continues to grow in competitive nature while still seeming to maintain the cooperative family spirit which hardrock prides itself upon. below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2016 contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in and who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in. last year the waitlists went 9 deep (13 in 2014) in the ‘never’ category. in the ‘else’ lottery the waitlist went 12 deep (16 in 2014), and in the ‘veteran’ category the entire waitlist of 8 runners will likely get into the race. a special thank you torob erskinewho provided this information through his blog. the competition on the men’s side most certainly features two-time returning championkilian jornetwho is likely returning to better his clockwise direction course record from 2014 of 22:41:33. while he is largely considered unbeatable on this mountain course boasting some 33,000 feet of ascent, he will be challenged byxavier thévenardwho has two ultra-trail du mont-blanc titles and could provide the most considerable challenge to jornet yet. throw injason schlarbwho has been incredibly consistent over the past two years in long, technical mountain races, and that should be an exciting race to watch.nick clarktook a bit of a sabbatical last year, but he has the experience and skills to also make the podium at hardrock. who knows what we will see out oftimothy olson, who has been pining to return for revenge on this course ever since his gutsy finish after an epic blow-up in 2014.jeff browningis always consistent in long mountain races. additionally, cagey returnees such astroy howard,scott jaime, andted mahonrarely have off-days. all in all, a solid men’s field. on the women’s side, this is the deepest field in recent memory with a lot of tough and experienced women who’ve performed well here in the past. last year’s championanna frostwill be returning to defend her title in the opposite direction. she will likely be chased by the entire podium from last year."
"included are three-time champdarcy piceu, who is on the ‘veterans’ waitlist but who will probably get in, as well asdarla askewwho was third here last year. newcomer to hardrock,bethany lewis, has not lost a 100-mile race yet and recently won the fat dog 120 mile in british columbia which is reportedly more difficult than hardrock.missy gosneyandmeghan hicks(4th and 7th from last year) now have experience on this course which will further place them in contention. throw inpetra pirc, a tough mountain runner who was third at the 2014 bear 100 mile, andbetsy kalmeyer, who is going for her 17th(!!!!) finish and who was second in 2014, as well askatie desplinter, who is high on the first-timers waitlist but who will probably get in. there is only one way to gain auto entry into hardrock, and that is by winning last year’s race.kilian jornetandanna frosthave both chosen to use those entries. here are the men who gained entrance via today’s lottery. here are the women who gained entrance via today’s lottery. here are the male contenders who were chosen in the top-20 slots of the first-timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the everyone else waitlist. these men have a good shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-20 slots of the first-timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the everyone else waitlist. these women have a decent shot of running. here are some fast men who are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. here are some fast women who are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. related articles:"

"then, when i saw how comfortable he looked cruising in the middle of the top 10 for more than half the race, it seemed like it was only a matter of time until he unleashed. at muir beach #2 at mile 40, since he’s a local boy, him arriving in second place garnered loads of cheers. dylan looked calm and in control from there through the finish. like clockwork, his calculated, cool effort is another stair step upward of improvement for him on this course. there’s only one spot left now to step up to and he showed us all today that he is capable of the big w here. dylan bowman working toward second place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell ryan bak, dude’s got wheels and he’s figuring out how to use them for 50 miles. he said after the race that he hasn’t been training too much due to a new baby at home and being busy at work, but that he managed to put together a month-long, crash-course training block to build upon a modest base. and that was apparently enough to do today’s trick. the steep ups and downs may still be proving to challenge ryan a bit, but the guy held his own in a stacked field. ryan bak near the course’s halfway point. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks moving on up, that’sjorge maravilla. his fifth finish here today is his best, a fourth place! no matter whether jorge is feeling good or bad, he always looks steady. and he always takes time to thank the volunteers and fans at aid stations. a class act all around. like his friend, dylan, jorge looked even-steven calm while running most of the race right in the middle of the top 10. jorge maravilla getting a congratulatory hug from his son, joaquin, after his fourth place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell ryan smithsaid at the finish that his aging legs struggled a bit on the downhills of the marin headlands, but he looked just fine as he cruised to fifth place. this performance, a ninth place at the 2015 ultra-trail du mont-blanc, and the rest of his results amount to what has truly been a breakout season. some said in the lead-up to this race that they thoughtryan kaiserwould finish well ahead of his just-one-position-outside-of-the-top-1o 11th place at western states. they were right and he rolled through in sixth place after a later-race duel with ryan smith, and he became the third guy with the name ryan to finish in the top 10 (and there would be another!). two years ago,dan kraftran to fourth place. last year he was 17th. it was hard to get a read on how he might do this year until game day as i know he’s been dealing with some physical issues. for much of the first half of the race, he ran at or just outside the top 10, slipped into it during the second half, and moved up to finish seventh. a smart race done so in quiet, confident style."
"if there was anyone who i expected to have a break-out day, it wasjustin houck. after what appeared to be some step-up performances throughout this year, he just seemed primed. early on he looked comfy running in the top 20. we first saw him inside the top 10 at muir beach #2, mile 40, where he was in eighth place. he maintained that to the finish. allan spanglerwho? well, if you hadn’t heard of allan before today, put the guy on your watch list. from alaska, he’s come south to race a couple times of late, including a strong eighth place at this fall’s the rut 50k. between that and ninth today, i sure hope we see more of his talent. ryan ghelfifinished 10th for the second time, in his fourth finish at this race. a 13th, 10th, 18th, and now 10th again, this guy knows how to race this race. notable drops includedmax king(pre-race interview), who said he felt the residual fatigue from a couple weeks of sickness,alex varner(pre-race interview), who wasn’t recovered from racing quad dipsea last weekend,alex nichols(pre-race interview), who succumbed to the plantar fasciitis he’s been suffering from for a while, and early leader tyler sigl. full results. what a 2015megan kimmel(pre-andpost-race interviews) has had. i really hope she goes home, puts her feet up, and is pleased with what she’s done. after a dnf here in 2012, 10th in 2013, and second last year, methinks megan came to win this year. while she hedged bets on herself during her pre-race interview with us, she said the same darn things in conversation before she tore up the rut 25k in september, handily winning. megan took things out hard and just hammered away the whole race, taking no mercy and seeming to encounter no issues that would let other women make up lost time. an impressive showing. megan kimmel, 2015 tnf ec 50 mile champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks ellie greenwood(pre-andpost-race interviews) may have finished in second place, but, oh my goodness, it looked like it was a struggle for her the whole way. when i saw her for the first time at muir beach #1, mile 12.7, her stride looked off, shorter and more guarded than usual. it seems like it didn’t really matter how she felt, she still pushed to eek as much out of herself as she could on the day. after running the first 25 or so miles outside the top five, she moved into it and up, little by little. she seemed so relieved to cross the line and sit down, and, to tell you the truth, i felt relieved to see her in a position of rest as well. ellie greenwood on her way to second place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell larisa dannis(post-race interview) is on her comeback after a year or so of injury. i’m pretty sure she didn’t hit the top 10 until after the halfway point."
"after the race, she said she took things out easy because she really wanted to be able to run a couple big climbs in the second half of the race. and, wow, she did. after hitting the top 10, she only kept moving up until she had made her way into third place. i suspect more good things are to come in larisa’s near future. larisa dannis is elated with third place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell fourth-placeruth croftwent for it, chasing leader megan kimmel for much of the race, and there’s really no reason to presume that wasn’t the right spot in the race for her, as she’s had some pretty phenomenal runs in 2015. while she slipped back to fourth place late in the race, she proved in a stacked field and with a fast time on this course that, as i overheard someone on the course say about her today, “she’s the real deal.” ruth croft after finishing fourth. photo: irunfar/bryon powell emily peterson’sname was dropped to us a couple times before the race as a local gal we might not know but who we should watch, and those sources were dead on. she looked super smooth almost every time we saw her, from the first aid station to the last. after her fifth place, i look forward to seeing what she does next. sixth place was occupied byanne-marie madden(pre-race interview). she may be new-ish to racing ultras–just a year into her 50-mile-ing career now–but when you watch her race, you know right away that she’s someone who is racing smart and within herself. seventh place waskeely henninger, who has had a couple other stellar results in trail ultras over the last year or so as well. jo meekwas eighth place. i think jo’s potential on a course like this is quite high, but she’s coming off a long period of injury, she’s been sick, and she just raced a stage race in nepal two weeks ago. she lives in the u.k. so it might be a lot to ask, but it sure would be great to see her put in a focused block of healthy training and rip up a race like this here in the states. ninth place wasdarcy piceu, andamanda bashamrounded out the women’s top 10. notable drops include last year’s winnermagda boulet(pre-race interview) andcassie scallon. full results. articles and photo galleries reports a big thank you to our field help hillary allen, elam king, and chris blagg. another thank you to our office help mauri pagliacci, travis trampe, nick pedatella, and aliza lapierre. thanks to all of you! related articles:"

"photo: irunfar/meghan hicks after not seeing each other during the middle of the race and aliza running some distance in front of fernanda, fernanda bridged the gap in the technical terrain between the aid stations at 141.7k and 157k, and put a small gap on aliza. fernanda might have been doubly inspired to move here as kaori was in the middle of a late-race surge, too. in this section, fernanda moved into second, kaori third, and aliza fourth. however, the pavement into the 157k aid station favored aliza, and she was able to pass kaori and reconnect with fernanda. from there, fernanda and aliza decided to work together, and would stay as a pair until the finish, where they crossed arm in arm. kaori rolled across the line a short 5.5 minutes later. aliza lapierre and fernanda maciel cross the line to finish second together along with great britain’s john adams. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks fifth place wasyukako takashima, sixth place wasyukari fukuda, and seventh place waskiyomi kuroda, all of japan. amy finished in eighth position, but, as previously explained, it remains to be seen if she’ll stay there due to a time penalty. japan’sharuka yamanouchiandemi sagawafinished in ninth and 10th positions. full results. articles and photo galleries race reports irunfar’s coverage of utmf was a result of the dedicated work of a number of volunteers and support staff. thank you to rob krar, aliza lapierre’s stepdad jeff, the north face san francisco ladies’ trio, nakata, and natsuki for assistance in telling utmf’s story! related articles:"

"maria dalzot, 2015 la sportiva mountain cup champion maria dalzotis the 2015 la sportiva mountain cup champion. in this interview, maria tells us about what she thought of the diversity of races in this year’s series, how she stepped up her game from previous years in the lsmc, and how she trains for shorter-distance trail running. irunfar:to get the lsmc win, you ran thehillybilly half marathonin washington state, thedon’t fence me in trail runin montana, therothrock challengein pennsylvania, and thela sportiva table rock 27kin cali. phew! that’s some geography. can you talk about the diversity of course layout, terrain, geography you experienced? maria dalzot:phew is right! is has been quite the year of traveling and racing. at the start of the year, my two goals for the spring/summer were to 1. make the u.s. team and perform well at theworld mountain running association’s long distance championships, and 2. win the la sportiva mountain cup. it was a grueling schedule, but to come out the other side having achieved my goals while staying healthy feels very satisfying. one of the biggest challenges with the mountain cup is figuring out logistically which races to run since they are spread out over the entire country and over six months. adding a trip to europe in the middle of it all was no easy task. hillbilly half marathon is just a 2.5-hour drive down i-5 (to olympia) for us so that made it very convenient start to the series in march. the course is typical pacific northwest, muddy and tree-covered trails. i ran don’t fence me in last year and had a really great experience so we definitely wanted to return now that i had run the course and knew what to expect. i love the northwest trails, but the trail system in helena (maintained by the prickly pear land trust) is awesome; smooth, runnable trails with incredible views for miles. that was may and by this time i knew i was headed to the wmra’s long distance championships in zermatt, switzerland (july 4th) so we decided to fit in a quick trip to see family in west virginia and jump into rothrock (about three hours away in pennsylvania). my main goal here was simply to garner some points with as little effort as possible since my focus was now on worlds. rothrock is one of those races that you are warned about, but have to run it to see for yourself. they weren’t kidding; rothrock is the most technical trail race i have ever run. the terrain was just rocks, rocks, and more rocks. i’m happy i made it through that one with just a few falls and scratches. after rothrock i headed to europe for the wmra’s long distance championships. ten days after returning to the states, i ran the la sportiva table rock 27k. table rock always has great competition and inside trail running does a fantastic job hosting. this year did not disappoint! this race was the most fun i had at the mountain cup this year."
"even though i didn’t win it was a blast trading the lead five times throughout the race withyiou wangand running 12 minutes faster than i had two years before. irunfar:i think this was your third year competing in the the cup, and your best performance so far, i believe. what has changed? training? other races? what has made you so successful this year? dalzot:i placed fourth in the cup in 2013 and 2014. i was battling injuries in 2013, and 2014 was a very competitive year. my racing success over the past 10 months is attributed to staying injury-free. i have been able to train consistently for two years now. another big change this year was thatmegan kimmeldecided to skip the mountain cup this year to focus on races in europe so that left the door wide open. irunfar:you seem to specialize in shorter to medium-length trail races. can you talk about the specific training that goes into that? speed and hill workouts each week? what’s your long-run distance? maybe lay out a week of training a couple weeks out from a goal race? dalzot:right now i’ve worked my way up to running between 70 and 80 miles a week with much of it on the trails and with two to three mountain-athlete strength sessions. my long run is 18 to 20 miles. i do a workout once a week that can consist of either a tempo, repeats, or some fartlek variation almost always on a crushed-gravel-type of surface. though sometimes i’ll do the workout on singletrack if the race i’m preparing for is more technical. irunfar:what’s on deck for you in the future? the rest of this season? next year? beyond? dalzot:i will be running theangel’s staircase 35knext weekend just because it is an easy trip and a great race hosted byjames varnerof rainshadow running. it is also part of the us skyrunner series. after angel’s my focus is on training for theusatf trail half marathon national championshipsin bellingham, washington. that race was a dream come true last year as i won my first national championship in my adopted hometown. after that i’ll close out the year with theustaf trail marathon national championshipsin moab, utah. to compete at the national-class level at the marathon, i still need to get faster at the shorter distances so i’ll continue training with that as the goal while at the same time gaining some more experience at the marathon and maybe start thinking about a 50k debut. ryan woods, 2015 la sportiva mountain cup champion ryan woodswon the la sportiva mountain cup for the third time. in the following interview, ryan talks about his struggle with the last race in the series, the jupiter peak steeplechase, how he went about winning this year’s competitive lsmc, and whether or not he’ll return next year.

"in this interview, sarah talks about her background in running, what she thought of the series, and how her race went at jupiter peak. [click hereif you can’t see the video above.click hereto read a transcript of this interview.] matt kempton, 2015 la sportiva mountain cup second place matt kemptontook second in the jupiter peak steeplechase, the last race in the la sportiva mountain cup, which sealed the deal on his second place in the series. in this interview, matt talks about the highs and lows of his jupiter peak race, his favorite race of the lsmc, and what else in running interests him. irunfar:you were second overall at jupiter peak. but you were first to the top, so you got king of the mountain. kempton:yes. irunfar:you said before the top rocked you, but you had a couple guys, one a minute behind you and one 45 seconds behind you, and you managed to hold them off to get king of the mountain? kempton:i was doing everything i could. i was near puking to get up. i come from a track and road background, so that is not my element. i was at a complete stop for nearly a minute at the top drinking water. i was toast. but part of my goal and my strategy going into the race was i knew it was a long shot to take first in the overall series. if everything worked out perfectly for me, not necessarily for others, if i would have won and conceivably [lsmc leader]ryan [woods]finished fifth or worse and we had enough contenders, there was still a chance. ryan is a great downhill runner as are a lot of guys in the series. uphills tend to be my strength. my strategy was to get to the top first. irunfar:and put as much distance between you and ryan as you could? kempton:that was exactly my plan. irunfar:did you at any point on the descent see him or was he out of view the entire time? kempton:no. i was trying to keep an honest pace on the downhill. i looked back at one point and saw third place behind me and realized that i was going to have to, not that i wasn’t working, but that i’d have to absolutely push it. irunfar:you had third place in the cup knocking down your door, too, right? kempton:yeah, andbret [ferrier]is a great runner. i didn’t want it to come down a kick finish with either of those two. i didn’t know if he was going to be the next one behind me or if ryan was. ryan and i have come down to a kick finish before, and he’s got a little bit better mile pr than i do on the track. i don’t want to kick against him again. irunfar:so it was a matter of crossing the finish and then counting runners. he rolled in fifth, and maintained his series lead. last question for you: the cup in general is a pretty cool series of races. every race is a different style."
"the geography is different; the climbs and descents are different. what has been your top experiences running around the country this year? kempton:the most enjoyable race that i went to, albeit a very short trip and i didn’t get to enjoy the area very much, was helena, montana. they do a great job. irunfar:the don’t fence me in trail run. kempton:the race director was very nice. i emailed her several times prior to the race. it’s a beautiful race, and they maximize their trails. that is a hard, hard course in a beautiful area. i would never have any other reason to go up there quite honestly. it was eye opening to the beauty that is in that area. irunfar:congrats. second at jupiter peak. second in the cup. going home with a little cash. king of the hill, too. kempton:yeah, thank you. men’s race and results tayte pollmann, 2015 jupiter peak steeplechase champion. photo: la sportiva/quinn carrasco after some early-race place changes,matt kemptontook over the lead and kept it all the way to the top of 9,998-foot jupiter peak, where skullcandy was giving away cash and swag to the king of the hill, the first male arrival. after topping out maxed out, matt stayed at the aid station recovering for about a minute, which allowedtayte pollmann, who was running in second, to pass and take the lead. tate gunned the downhill hard and arrived the winner, unchallenged by anyone between jupiter peak and the finish. matt recuperated enough atop the peak to maintain second place. matt kempton on jupiter peak. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks third placenoah brautigamtook the ascent conservatively, arriving to the top in eighth place before moving up five positions from jupiter peak to the finish. noah brautigam getting ready to move from eighth to third on the downhill. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results. women’s race and results eventual second placemarta larsenlooked like she really wanted the skullcandy queen of the hill prime, and she arrived to the summit of jupiter peak working it, a minute in front of the rest of the field. just after the summit,sarah kjorstad, who was running in second at the peak, took over the lead and put time on the rest of the field to finish with a solid win. sarah kjorstad, 2015 jupiter peak steeplechase champion. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks marta larsen held her own, gunning across the line for second. marta larsen on jupiter peak. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks anna rudolphi, who topped out on jupiter peak in fourth place, moved up between the peak and the finish to claim the final spot on the women’s podium. anna rudolphi smiling her way to third place. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks full results (when available). ryan woods interview transcript irunfar:meghan hicks of irunfar here, and i’m at the finish line of the jupiter peak steeplechase. i’m with la sportiva mountain cup winner,ryan woods. hey, dude. ryan woods:hey. irunfar:how’s it going? woods:good. irunfar:congratulations! woods:thank you. irunfar:top-five finish today to seal off your victory in the la sportiva mountain cup. woods:yes. irunfar:you’ve run jupiter peak steeplechase a couple of times."
"woods:this is my third time. irunfar:so you know the pain that’s coming when you’re standing at the starting line of this race. woods:yeah, you kind of dread it. i was saying earlier, i’m getting over a cold and my breathing isn’t that good. when you know you’ve got to climb about 3,000 feet in about seven-and-a-half miles, it’s not something that you look forward to. i was just trying to get out there and survive. irunfar:you toe the line; you’ve got a cold; you’re trying to escape doing something that messes up your point standings in the cup and staying in the money in the cup. woods:yes, trying to finish. irunfar:yeah, what goes through your mind at the starting line when you know you’ve got to climb 3,000 feet before anything else happens? woods:well, at the starting line, i’m just super confident. i think,ah, i’m fine. cold. here. you’re going to be alright, but it’s about a mile up when you’re like,oh, i can’t breathe, and i’m congested, and people are passing me. maybe i should just turn around and head back down the mountain. no, it was a battle up the mountain. i was saying earlier, at the scramble at the top where you climb basically on all fours in loose rocks, i got to the bottom of that in eighth place, and i think i caught about three people on it which was surprising because i’ve never been in the position in this race where i was around people in the scramble. it just seems so hectic. i didn’t think people really made up ground. it was kind of nice to get some ground. when i got to the top, i could just be in position. i could still run the downhills without really needing my lungs. i really put way the three guys i passed there. i kept the guy in sight for awhile, but i was really more focused on the people behind me than i was the people in front of me. so i just kept moving and just kept a decent pace on the downhills. last year when i did this race, i was like 5:15 pace on it. this year it was more like 5:45. that was enough. it’s a blazing-fast downhill, but it’s long. after eight miles of it, you do start to feel the toes and quad. everything hurts at the end. irunfar:it’s a pretty amazing downhill. like you said, it’s about eight miles and almost every bit of it is sweetly runnable, but when you put it all together… woods:mountain-bike trails—when you get the smooth curves, it’s very runnable. irunfar:so you worked your way up and you had… woods:first, i worked my way way back. i think i had the lead in the first mile—ah yeah, this is good—then everyone just kept going past me and they’re having conversation. i’m blowing snot rockets. it was not… it was getting bad there in those three-to-six mile marks."
"irunfar:then you passed a couple people on the last little steep bit, and you’re a guy who’s known for your downhilling ability. so you must have sort of let confidence take over and just let it roll and do what you needed to do. woods:that’s exactly what i kept telling myself. i was saying,just keep them in sight. you’re not feeling good. this isn’t going to be your day. keep them in sight so you’ve got the opportunity still in the downhill. everything in my body was just saying,turn around. head down the mountain. call it a day, but the ability to run the downhill gave me confidence. even though i wasn’t as fast as i had been in the past, i knew i’d be okay if i could just get with those guys or stay in touch with them. irunfar:the only guy who you needed to fend off in the cup wasmatt [kemper]in second place. he was in front of you, it must have been from… woods:he was a dot in the sky. i had a pretty good points lead on him. i’d won my first four races in the series, and i’d beaten him twice in them. in the mountain cup series, head-to-heads are very important especially after you’ve gotten some points and you’re in the top-ten. you get five points on top of somebody for beating them. it’s a 10-point swing in the series if they beat you. if they beat you, you’re five points behind. if you beat them, you’re five points ahead. those two early wins i had against him made it so i could have a “comfortable-ish,” it wasn’t comfortable at all… irunfar:survivable? woods:survivable day today. if i had to race, it wouldn’t have gone well. it would have gone about like the mountain championships did last weekend. irunfar:talk about that for a minute. you’re coming off three mountain races in a row—the north american championships two weeks ago, the mountain-running championships last weekend, and now here. similar style of races, but every race had its unique characteristics. after three weekends of mountain races, what are your thoughts? woods:i’m tired. irunfar:are you ready for a break? woods:i do a lot of racing back and forth. i don’t really train for peaks anymore. i’m 36, and i’ve kind of got this baseline that i can keep through the year. a lot of time i like to race my way into shape. the first race in vancouver, i thought it went pretty good. it was two loops. the first loop was smaller—good climbing, good descent, fast runnable sections. i stuck with the leaders on that. then you had a mile with 1,000 feet of climbing. i lost the leaders there. then you had this technical section at the top where one guy caught me. then you had a screaming downhill at the end. i nearly caught some folks on that, but the technical sections, when it’s new technical trail you’ve never been on, it’s difficult."
"i feel pretty competent on some of the technical stuff, but then again, sometimes i don’t. if you got some experience, it helps a lot. again, the downhill was good for me there. then the mountain championships, i was a little feverish. i was just trying to survive out there. i don’t know why i didn’t drop out of that one either. i held on and finished. you feel good finishing even if it’s not a good performance. that’s something i try and do, but i’ve got a lot of dnfs over the years now… too many. irunfar:you’re now a three-time winner of the la sportiva mountain cup. what keeps you coming back to this race series? woods:great travel. it’s always seemed to work out when there’s been two drives i can do, and then you’ve got three flights. in years past, we’ve made vacations out of those flights. last year we spent about five days out here in park city. this year we’re going to leave quickly because we spent vacation last week and then in vancouver. what was earlier in the year? didn’t make a trip this year actually on the mountain cup, but usually we make a vacation of it. there weren’t a whole lot of new spots on it. moab has been on the series before. new mexico… a lot of really cool areas. tahoe was on it years ago. a lot of cool areas to visit—that’s kind of what keeps me going and keeps me coming back. irunfar:do you think you’ll give it a shot again in the future or try something different? woods:yeah, absolutely. irunfar:you’re kind of a la sportiva mainstay at this point. woods:i am. i have been doing different stuff. i’ve gotten into obstacle racing—spartans and battle frogs. i’m trying to work out the upper body more now. it’s cool because as i’m slowing down, i don’t do road 5k’s anymore. i’ve lost a lot of speed, so i don’t have as much fun with it anymore. trails, i’m slowing down a little bit, but in the obstacle stuff i’m still the fast guy. you’re training new stuff. i like to diversify. irunfar:you’re keeping your mind fresh, too. woods:yes. new stuff that you’ve got a good energy in… i’ll do more of the mountain stuff but the obstacle races, i think, will be in the next couple of years until my body breaks down which might be sooner rather than later. we’ll see. irunfar:awesome. let’s not jinx ourselves, shall we? woods:no. irunfar:congratulations on your win of the 2015 la sportiva mountain cup. woods:thank you.saraj kjorstad interview transcript irunfar:meghan hicks of irunfar, and i’m here at the finish line of utah’s jupiter peak steeplechase. this is race 10 in the la sportiva mountain cup. i’m here withsarah kjorstadwho just won the race and who finished second in the cup. congratulations. sarah kjorstad:thank you. irunfar:how’s it going? kjorstad:good, really good. i’m just happy to be done. irunfar:this is a tough race."
"it’s a 15-ish mile race that has 3,300 feet of climb that comes all at once. this is an all uphill and then all downhill race. talk about how it feels. talk about how it went out there for you today. kjorstad:this race actually suits me because i’m not a super-strong climber, but i can muscle my way through it and at least keep the competition in my sights. i just kind of bide my time and get to the top. then once i’m at the top, then it’s all… that’s when my race starts, when the downhill comes. that, to me, is easy and i take it fast and hard and i can at least catch, gain a lot of ground, and then put a little space or distance between me and the next girl. so that happened out there. irunfar:i was up on jupiter peak and saw you up there. you were in second place with another gal just behind you and you were just chatting away, not even breathing hard. kjorstad:so maybe i could work a little harder on the uphill. [laughs] irunfar:did you feel pretty good coming up that last little scramble there? kjorstad:yeah, i like that little scramble there. it’s actually kind of a break. it’s a little bit of a… it’s almost like recover from that solid, non-stop up. it’s something different. that scramble or that hike is nice. it’s just kind of a recovery before the big downhill. so, yeah, it was fun. there was another one of the women, we were talking about how the girl wanted the climb queen of the mountain more than we did, so we were just chatting. it was fun. irunfar:somarta larsenwas about a minute ahead of you topping out. she got queen of the hill. she got the skullcandy prize for that. when did you pass her, and how did that go? kjorstad:right after the top. irunfar:was it before the next little blip? kjorstad:yeah, i just knew… like i said, the downhill is my thing. i knew as soon as… i could have probably caught her, but i just wanted her to get that. i really wanted her to get the prize, so i let her go. when i got to the top, i knew i was going to take her from there. that’s when i started racing, that peak and then it was all hard from there. irunfar:let’s talk about the mountain cup for a minute. you just came in second. what races did you do this year and how were they… what’s really cool about the mountain cup is the geographic and terrain diversity represented by the races. they’re all over the country and they’re all different styles. kjorstad:the mountain cup is great. it works well for me because i’m sort of centrally located in the states. it’s perfect for my location. i was just thinking that my family lives in the west coast, and there are a couple races out there that i can justify driving over for."
"this year i did thehillbilly halfwhich was the first, and my brother lives in portland (oregon), so i went and visited him and did that race. that was the first one. the second one i did was the helena (montana)don’t fence me in. we actually lived in helena for a couple of years, so it’s home to me. irunfar:feels like home a little bit? kjorstad:the trail system there is amazing, and the weather is always great, and the support is wonderful. i love that race, and did that one. then i was thinking about thevail hill climb, but this year it looked like there weren’t as many people in the mix as far as the cup went, so i could maybe not do as many races and just do three and still eke by into the money. so, i risked it and took the gamble and just waited until the last one to come finish it out. irunfar:you had a great day here. kjorstad:i did have a great day here. it was fun. i feel like i earned my place into that, into the money. it was good. irunfar:you ran this race before. is there… you’re kind of a local. you live in jackson, wyoming. is there something that draws you back to the jupiter peak race? is it that it suits your interest? is it the terrain here? kjorstad:yeah, it is a great time of the year. it’s beautiful. i’m a summer kind of girl, so i love the weather. the course does suit me. i love that solid downhill and the climb is… living in jackson, i feel i have an advantage with the elevation, too. it’s kind of at similar elevations. i run a lot of similar trails in jackson, so i have that advantage. irunfar:everything is big climbs and big descents? kjorstad:big climbs at higher elevations—it just feels like it’s a good race that suits me. great support. on the trail today, there were mountain bikers and hikers and every single one of them was counting what female runner i was. even just random hikers with their dogs, “you’re number 33 and first woman!” every hiker i passed—it’s such a great community and a great support for their local athletes and local sports. irunfar:last couple of questions for you. this is our first time interviewing you. i’d love to know a little bit of background on you. you’re a mom. you’re a physical therapist when you’re not being a mom. kjorstad:i am. yes, i am. i’m a physical therapist. i stay at home with my son though, full-time now. i have a six-year-old little guy, and he’s super fun. he loves to run, too, so i’m hoping that will… irunfar:rub off on him a little bit? kjorstad:yeah. he keeps me busy when i’m not training. irunfar:what kind of racing are you into? the la sportiva mountain cup is just short, grinding, really tough races with a lot of vertical. are you into that style of racing or do you do other styles of races, too? kjorstad:apparently i am."
"irunfar:“i didn’t know i was…” kjorstad:i’m kind of afraid of trying to do… i’m thinking about moving into the 50k longer stuff. i’m just so used to going hard and running hard, hurting suffer fests. i’ve heard… i feel like the longer things would be harder, but i’ve heard they’re nice because they’re not as fast. i’m thinking maybe… i don’t know. that distance doesn’t at all sound appealing to me, but maybe it would be a nice change of pace from these “shorter” 18 miles. it seems… but you still have to run them pretty intensely. yeah, i might try to move up to the 50k this year or maybe 50 miles. we’ll see. irunfar:experiments. dangerous experiments. kjorstad:i’m signed up forthe rut 50k. i’m still a little nervous about it. for my first one it’s like an intense course. irunfar:it is a “go big”-type course for your first 50k. kjorstad:go out with a bang, or go in with a bang. irunfar:you’re a mountain girl and used to trails in the rocky mountain region. congratulations again. kjorstad:thank you. irunfar:enjoy your victory lap around park city. congrats on your second place in la sportiva mountain cup this year, too. kjorstad:thanks a lot. related articles:"

"but maciel had obviously found this section tough and dropped a further eight minutes on second place but was now in fourth with french ladyclaire nedelecmoving up the into the third spot. fernanda maciel would finish in third place. photo: irunfar/ian campbell a steep climb to refugio auronzo was next and as the various crews waited for thier runners, espressos in hand, durán was the first to stride through. a quick refuel by his efficient crew and he was out in less than 90 seconds just as dapit came into the checkpoint. three minutes later and we had a new third place with hawker and hermansen literally right behind him. in what was a trademark effort, hermansen grabbed what he needed from his crew and was cheered out of the refugio within seconds, leaving hawker refueling. what had happened to clavery, had he dropped? no, but he had obviously found the climb up to the refugio tough. he had dropped a total of nine minutes from the leader and there was still 71k to go. was this the slippery slope for this frenchmen? 2015 lavaredo ultra trail’s second place erik clavery. photo: irunfar/ian campbell around 23 minutes off the lead man, mauclair arrived still in the lead, but only just as chaverot was now only two minutes behind. what lay next was a 19k, down-and-flat section to cimabanche at 67k and it was where chaverot made her decisive move to win the race. by the time she arrived, she had not only passed mauclair but she now had a three-minute lead and it was a lead she was never going to relinquish despite some bad patches later on. the section down from refugio auronzo was also instrumental in the men’s race. hermansen, who was fourth now, laid down the gauntlet to the rest of the field by charging down the mountain, displaying his superb race speed on the flat section. he took the lead by a clear minute. similarly to chaverot, it was a lead he was never to lose. durán, dapit, and hawker remained in the same order although durán looked particularly fatigued at this halfway point. another 500-meter climb faced them as they headed toward 75k and the checkpoint at malga ra stua. hermansen was comfortably in the lead from dapit but durán’s fatigue showed and he had dropped to third with hawker still in fourth with a 15-minute gap separating these top four. the race was on but little did anyone know that clavery had revived and was about to fight back. meanwhile, chaverot had built up a four-minute lead over mauclair as they came into the lush pastureland of malga ra stua. it was now a question of who had looked after themselves and who would be strong enough to hang onto the finish as there was still a tough, 800-meter climb to get to the 95k point of col gallina. hermansen remained strong and had increased his lead to 10 minutes from a now-fighting durán in second place."
"hermansen’s approach to checkpoints remained the same as his crew ran beside him, swapping over bottles. it was at this point that dapit threw in the towel with a dnf. hawker, who knew he was being chased down, took a phone call from his wife in new zealand and moved out quickly. he didn’t have time to see then but he would see it later: a revived clavery was on the charge and he was only five minutes behind. at passo giau and 102k, it’s a spectacular scene with the mountains behind the runners. hermansen’s determination had enabled him to stretch out his lead over durán to 20 minutes. with only 17k to go, victory was his unless something went seriously wrong. but for durán, second place was not a certainty. clavery had passed hawker, who had taken a wrong turn, and was now nine minutes behind durán. chaverot was increasing her lead over mauclair with every kilometer she passed and was well within the course record. the crowds at the cortina finish became excited. nathalie mauclair at an aid station while headed toward second place. photo: irunfar/ian campbell didrik hermansen was expected in cortina any minute. as he came into view, he moved from side to side to high-five the fans and take in this wonderful moment before crossing the finish line. it had taken him 12:34:29 to traverse the course. he was ecstatic but calm. erik clavery had charged out early in the race, dropped back, and then revived when dawn had broken to work his way back up and past the field to take second place in 13:01:07. there were tears in his eyes as he crossed the line. it had been one hell of a journey for him. and as for yeray durán, he hung on, fighting to claim the final podium spot in 13:04:16. his celebrations were as if he had won the race, so celebratory was his journey through these mountains. the 2015 lavaredo ultra trail men’s podium, left to right: second place erik clavery, winner didrik hermansen, and third place yeray durán. photo: irunfar/ian campbell we didn’t wait that long for the first lady to cross the line. caroline chaverot crossed the finish line arms raised and crowds applauding her achievement. not only had she crossed the line in 10th overall, she reset the course record by 49 minutes in 13:40:34. nathalie mauclair must have found the final stretch into cortina hard but second place was hers. she was greeted excitedly by the awaiting fans in cortina. mauclair crossed the line in 14:25:02 and four minutes within the old course record. fernanda maciel had struggled and then revived her race, picking up places and eventually finishing in a satisfying third place and 15:18:35. full results. full results. articles and photo galleries race reports we would like to thank the following people who helped with irunfar’s live coverage: emily chang, pauliina baretta, gary dalton, scott hawker’s crew member ben, and the rest of the north face crew. related articles:"

"when we next saw luis alberto at 79.5k, at the top of the last climb, he’d fallen into second position, where he would stay. luis alberto hernando racing at the marathon mark. photo: irunfar/bryon powell france’spatrick bringer(post-race interview) really brought it with his third-place finish. in the early part of the race, patrick ran outside of the men’s top 10, lingering between 10th and 13th places. it wasn’t until after halfway that he started plowing his way through the field. at 50k, he’d moved into seventh and it looked like he was toying with the tough climb at col de la forclaz, like it was an easy game for him. then, at the top of the next climb, at 58k, patrick was in fourth. he assumed third position after 71k whensebastien spehler, who had been running in front of him, dropped from the race. patrick bringer climbing at 50k. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks fourth placetom owens, of great britain, was the move-up man, much like patrick bringer. tom and patrick were running a similar pace for the first half of the race, just outside the top 10. in the race’s second half, tom slowly clawed his way forward in the pack, saying at the finish that this was a result of him not feeling too great early on, and feeling better and better as the race progressed. during the final climb between 71k and 79.5k, tom found and stuck to fourth place. france’sludovic pommeretemployed the same strategy as patrick and tom to bring home his fifth place, though he got aggressive about starting to move up positions earlier in the race, maybe just a third of the way in. the united states’salex nichols(pre-race interview) gets my hat tip for the most well-played race. what do you think of this? forty-first place at 8k, 29th place at 18k, 21st place at 33k, 17th at 44k, 12th at 50k, 10th at 58k, still 10th at 71k, then–wait for it–sixth at 79.5k, before finishing sixth overall. dude, that’s a heckuva race. france’snicolas martinwas seventh, france’sxavier thévenardeighth, iceland’sthorbergur jonssonninth, and norway’sdidrik hermansen10th. full results. as per iau rules, teams bringing more than six athletes have to choose the six who are eligible to help score team points before the race.team francechose to not include xavier thévenard,benoit cori, and ludovic pommeret on their potential scorers’ list. so scoring came from the times of top-three finishers on france’s list of potential scorers, meaning individual winner sylvain court (8:15:38), third place patrick bringer (8:21:43), and seventh place nicolas martin (8:41:01). despite not being able to count some of their top finishers, the team came out with a large-margin win for the team gold medal. early in the race, it was looking as ifteam united statesmight not be in medal contention at all, because team france and team spain were dominating. however, patience pays off and it certainly did for this group. alex nichols’s sixth place (8:38:15) was the top american finish, withdavid laney’s12th (9:02:44) andalex varner’s(pre-race interview) 18th place (9:21:00) being the balance of the team usa scorers."
"early-race leadertim tollefsondropped from the race with a foot injury. the team bronze medal goes toteam great britain, which was led by tom owens’s fourth place (8:26:23),kim collison’s20th place (9:22:02), andlee kemp’s27th place (9:37:32). team spainfell out of medal contention after being in the game earlier, due to drops among their front runners; they finished fourth. full results. holy smokes did the french women take the race out hard! from the get go, it wasanne-lise rousset,caroline chaverot(post-race interview), andnathalie mauclair(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) pushing the up-front pace. by just 8k into the race, the trio had set themselves apart by a minute from the field. another 10k later, they were 5.5 minutes off the rest of the pack. and, at 27k, the threesome was very close together and eight minutes ahead of all the other women. anne-lise rousset and nathalie mauclair running together at 27k. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks nathalie mauclair, 2015 iau trail world champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell from there, the pack splintered. at 36k, caroline was in the lead by 3.5 minutes, with nathalie second and anne-lise now six minutes back. at 42.5k, it was the same story: caroline off the front, nathalie chasing, and anne-lise solidly in third. the race would stay this way until the descent between 65k and 71k, where nathalie ate into all but about 45 seconds of caroline’s three-minute lead. it was not long after, at the beginning of the last long climb to mont baron at 79.5k, in which nathalie took over and held onto the women’s lead. what a powerhouse she is, and this win makes two in a row for her at the 2013 and 2015 iau trail world championships. (the event his held every two years.) early leader anne-lise would go on to finish fourth. caroline chaverot climbing at 58k. photo: kirsten kortebein spain’smaite maiora(post-race interview) ran the first half of the race in fourth place, then wedged her way up into third place when anne-lise slowed and she stayed strong. maite said about 10 days ago that she has a fracture in her tibial plateau from a fall while training, but she started and finished this race. for most of the race, she looked as if she was running normally and without pain, but at the top of the last climb at 79k, she was favoring her injured leg quite heavily. strong performance aside, i sure hope maite’s health wasn’t compromised for it. maite maiora running into town at 71k. photo: irunfar/meghan hicks count switzerland’sandrea huseramong the women who started more slowly and finished strong, running a smart race. her fifth place was a result of running outside the top 10 until after the marathon mark, running into ninth by 50k, then seventh at 58k, sixth place at 61k, and fifth place at 79.5k. sixth place, spain’suxue fraile(pre-race interview), also ran a smart race. she, too, was outside the women’s top 10, until she snuck her way in by the 50k point and just kept moving up in places."
"france’smaud gobert, who was the 2011 iau trail world champion, finished seventh, sweden’smimmi kotkaeighth, the czech republic’sanna strakovaninth, and spain’steresa nimes10th. americanscassie scallon,krissy moehl, andamy rusieckifinished respectively in 12th, 20th, and 48th. full results. as in the men’s race,team francewas the runaway victor in the women’s team race. also like the men’s french team, several top-finishing women were left off the list of potential scorers due to iau rules which required teams to choose six potentially scoring women ahead of the race. this meant that the scores ofjuliette benedicto, anne-lise rousset, andsylvaine cussotwould not count toward the team performance. so the scoring came from nathalie mauclair’s win (9:30:59), caroline chaverot’s second place (9:33:21), and maud gobert’s seventh place (10:33:25). again like the men’s team, despite not being able to count one of their top finishers, team france won team gold without challenge. as expected, women’steam spaincompeted well, with maite maiora’s third place (9:39:36), uxue fraile’s sixth place (10:25:25), and teresa nimes’s 10th place (10:55:46) leading them to a team silver medal. withteam italy, it seems that conservative running paid off. they finished with a team bronze medal courtesy oflisa borzani’s11th place (10:59:02),sonia glarey’s13th place (11:01:38), andvirginia oliveri’s29th place (11:38:56). full results. articles and photo galleries race reports a big thank you to our on-course helpers and translators, mauri pagliacci, kirsten kortebein, jamie wentworth, rodrigo lizama, and anne-marie dunhill. merci beaucoup, we can’t do this without the community! related articles:"

"every time we saw him, at 16k, 20k, 23k, and 28k, he was in the thick of things, right around the middle of the top-10 men. he finished fifth. sixth place was spain’sjessed hernandez, seventh was france’smichel lanne, eighth waszaid ait malek(a moroccan living in spain) (pre-race interview), ninth was ionut zinca who flagged some from his early aggression, and 10th was spain’shassan ait chaou. pere rullán celebrates finishing third. photo: irunfar/bryon powell spain’skilian jornet, a late entrant into the race, was among the top runners–and even leading at 23k–until after the 28k andraitz summit. after that, he faced some stomach problems–we understand them to be residual from his time in nepal–and slowed. he eventually finished in 22nd place, even though he probably arrived to the outskirts of zegama inside the top 10. he stopped to shake hands with pretty much anyone who wanted to meet him on his way to the finish line. smiles and an upset stomach… sums up kilian jornet’s 2015 zegama. photo: irunfar/bryon powell full results. oh, wow, what a women’s race! spain’soihana kortazarwas definitely the aggressive pace-setter for the race’s first half. we saw her leading a tight group of absolutely charging women at 16 kilometers, 20k, and 23k. the two-time zegama champion has one of the fastest women’s times on the course, and it’s easy to see why when you see her race, wicked-fierce ascending and pounding out the technical stuff like it’s a sunday stroll. however, though she was in what looked like attack mode for the race’s first half, she had a whole pile of women in tow. after 23k, at the summit of aizkorri, what follows is a super-technical ridge traverse and descent, and it was on that descent that championazara garcía(post-race interview), a rising star of european mountain running from spain, took over the lead for good. each time we saw azara prior to 23k, she was just on oihana’s heels. after the race she said she had a hard time in the middle part of the race, but it was on that descent after 23k that she felt better and was able to race her hardest. from that descent to the marathon-distance finish line, she carved a small but meaningful-enough lead over the rest of the women’s field, thereby becoming the women’s champion in her first time at zegama. for her effort, azara was also crowned the european champion in the skyrunning continental championships sky category. azara garcía, 2015 zegama marathon champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell second placepaula cabrerizo, of spain, like azara was there all of the race’s first half, just in the shadows of the other top women. at 23k, however, atop the aizkorri summit, paula was essentially together with oihana and azara, not behind them anymore. at 28k, at the top of the last climb of andraitz, paula had placed herself solidly in second, where she would eventually finish. paula cabrerizo finishing in second. photo: irunfar/bryon powell."

"jim walmsley went big early and it didn’t work out for a podium spot; however, he greatly impressed by regrouping after mile 30 and holding his position. seth swanson couldn’t match the speed of the guys up front, but ran a steady race to finish more or less in the place he held all day, minus the two drops in front of him. jorge maravilla doing his thing. photo: irunfar/bryon powell tim tollefsonbounced around between eighth and tenth through the race and he held on to that position, when accounting for aish and krar. on the other hand, mike wardian seemed far out of the hunt early and was no better than 15th at mile 20, 17 minutes off the lead. he was, however, basing his race off heart rate and cruised up the field as the race progressed.max king(pre-race interview)… well,he did say before the racethat he had tired legs from the la marathon. it turned into a long training run for him early. he was already lackadaisical in walking across the stream crossing at mile 12. kudos togary gellinfor going out hard and holding on to break seven hours after being just over the mark the past two years. that 6:59-and-change was good enough to give him tenth. max king calmly crosses a stream at mile 12. photo: irunfar/bryon powell gary gellin is one excited guy. photo: irunfar/bryon powell on the women’s side, it wasstephanie howe’sday. the previous two years, she’d finished third and second at lake sonoma and she was bound and determined to win this year. she was joined early in the race byyiou wangandkerrie wladwithsarah bardin hot pursuit. by mile 20, sarah had fallen nine minutes off the lead into sixth with yiou and kerrie 20 and 60 seconds back, respectively. 2013 champcassie scallon(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews)was 90 seconds back at 12 miles and 4 minutes back at mile 20. behind her, there was a gap back to the rest of the field. at mile 12,ashley erba(post-race interview),keely henninger,kaci lickteig,lindsay tollefson, andpam smithcame through in sixth through tenth, all between six and seven minutes off the lead. the leading ladies at mile 12. photo: irunfar/bryon powell by the time the ladies were back liberty glen–mile 30, stephanie had built an eight minute lead on cassie who now ran in second. kerrie wlad was just a bit behind cassie in third. neither woman looking nearly as comfortable as steph, who’s smiled and laughed as she ran past on a descent uphill. ashley was in fourth not far back, with yiou close behind. there was now an even bigger gap back to lindsay, sarah (who’d quickly fallen back to seventh), and another gap back to kaci,meghan arbogast, anddenise bourassa. stephanie howe leading 30 miles into the race. photo: irunfar/bryon powell while stephanie kept driving home for the course record and cassie ran strong toward a second-place finish, carnage descended on the women’s race. yiou badly sprained a previously surgically-repaired ankle and dropped."

"but i saw a week’s worth of saharan sunrises and sunsets, saw all seven of my tentmates reach the finish, and i reached my own personal mds goal: five finishes. and for this moment, this last night in the desert, that is all i need. field report – from kirstern kortebein today’s 42.2-kilometer route was a scenic one, including dunes, camel herds, oueds, and plateaus. the temperatures were not as high as they have been for most of the week, but many competitors were struggling with stomach issues starting today’s final stage. the race organization opted once again for a staggered start–first group departing at 7:00 am bmt, second group departing at 8:30 am–and decided to reorganize the finish line setup to avoid the queue chaos of last year’s finish line. medals were handed out not only by patrick, but by other mds personnel as well. this really did help avoid the backup that had happened at the finish line last year, and runners were able to receive their medals and water rations fairly immediately after finishing. women’s race swedeelisabet barnesfinished first in today’s marathon stage, wrapping up her sweep of first-place finishes in all five stages of this year’s mds. she says that she didn’t feel well waking up this morning, though; she was struggling with a sore throat and stomach issues before the race start. “i was forced to start out sensibly,” she said. “natalia [sedykh]shot off as expected, but i passed her after about 4 kilometers.” elisabet says that she really enjoyed the course, but that the end–the final hills, and seeing dunes in the distance–was rough for her. natalia’s initial kick wasn’t enough to bring her into second place overall, though. she ultimately finished today’s stage in third place, and was very emotional as she finished just behind britain’sanna-marie watson. natalia and anna-marie now sit in second and third places, respectively. usa’selizabeth howardwas feeling much better during today’s marathon stage, and set off strong in the early start (7:00 am bmt.) she was the fifth woman to cross the finish line today, coming in two minutes after britain’srebecca ferry. usa’smeghan hicksand france’slaurence kleinfinished today’s race in 14th and 29th places respectively, and meghan finished in fifth place overall. laurence was tired but calm as she crossed the finish line, and seemed content in having accepted the fact that she would not be finishing top five in this year’s mds. men’s race morocco’srachid el morabity,abdelkader el mouaziz, andaziz el akadtook first, second, and third in today’s stage, finishing respectively in said places overall. the front of the pack stuck together for the majority of the race, with rachid and el mouaziz running together until the last 200 meters. “we are running for the same team,” said rachid regarding himself and el mouaziz. “since we’re running together, it didn’t matter which one of us won [today’s stage. ]” aziz el akad is very happy with his success in this year’s marathon des sables, and is particularly proud of his performance during the long stage."
"“[the long stage] was the only solution for me to place on the podium,” he said. morocco’ssamir akhdarfinished today’s stage in fourth place, securing an overall ranking of fourth place. samir credits his success in this year’s mds to having focused on running his own race and following his own rhythm instead of getting caught up in trying to stick with the front-runners in the way he has in the past. “you are the chief of your own body,” he said with a smile. jordan’ssalameh el aqrais still struggling with a torn muscle in his lower left leg, but still managed to finish fifth in today’s marathon stage. this puts him in fifth place overall. “i finished 91 kilometers with this leg injury [during the long stage]” he said. “what’s 42 more?” additional information stage 4: jebel zireg to jdaid (91.7 km) men – stage 4 defending champrachid el morabityran up front all from “go.” (well, up front all except for the 1,200 runners who started three hours before him. )salameh al aqra(+1:02:53) andabdelkader el mouaziz(+7:53) went with rachid through checkpoint 2 (26km)… that’s when the tractor-pull sled started creeping up al aqra’s back… dropping him to eighth by the end of the day. on the other hand, el mouaziz hung with el morabity past the final checkpoint at 85.7km. yeah… and then el morabity put 8 minutes on el mouaziz in 6 kilometers. boom! segment. stage. race. el morabity. rachid el morabity wins the long stage. photo: kirsten kortebein aziz el akaddid prove himself to be the master today. he was in 12th 12km, ninth at 26km, and seventh at 38km… he was in third for good before the final checkpoint at 86km. chapeau, el akad. having metsamir akhdar(+43:50) as a “kid” back in 2009 and having known his gracious smile since then, personally, it’s great to see samir take fourth in today’s long stage. in the past, he’s been overshadowed by his moroccan friends and teammates. well, the sun rose on samir akhdar today!chema martínezwas the top european today, only four minutes behind akhdar. chema went out in fourth past 26km before dropping all the way back to ninth. he then proceeded to climb all the way back to fifth for the day. both el mouaziz and martínez went into the race with other favorites doubting each’s ability to perform in the long stage… well, both ran strong with el mouaziz nailing it. (there’s no shame in losing to the defending champ.) chema martínez celebrates his fifth-place finish in the long stage. photo: kirsten kortebein in an otherwise typically dynamic stage, it looks like france’schristophe le saux(+51:39) ran in sixth all day. that’s a nice improvement from his already solid eighth-place finish in last year’s long stage. le saux’s teammate and countrymanantoine guillon(+1:01:12) finished ten minutes further back in seventh. a steady eddie, he gradually worked himself up from tenth position at 12km. behind al aqra in ninth was the swissmarco de martin(+1:11:43), who (figuratively) appears to have been towed by guillon by a bungee cord."

"a podium position or even a top-five spot is a significant honor at the marathon des sables and with stage 4 often being a dramatic shakeup of the race, either the top-10 overall women or all women within three hours of the lead through stage 3 start with the later group. as it stands, two women werede factoracing for second in the stage and in the overall rankings, while being separated by three hours. they could not know their relative positions. the top 5 cutoff may have made since in times when there was not as much depth in the women’s field, but even after two podium position women blew up in today’s stage, 11 women finished within 3 hours of the women’s winner… and, more importantly, within 25 minutes of the final non-blown up woman–gemma game–from the late start. all of those women were also within 25 minutes of gemma at 35km, at which point i’d guess these women would have started catching the back of the pack from the early starters… had they been in the late start. my point with this paragraph is that having five to 10 additional women start in the “late start” would not significantly burden the races infrastructure by forcing checkpoints to be open significantly longer.] back to today’s stage…claire morrissey(+1:31:24),meghan hicks(+1:40:24), andjolanda linschooten(+2:10:42) all bounced around within a few minutes of another through the first 40km or so before they shook out into their finishing order of 4-5-6 on the day. jolanda faded a good bit more than the other two at the end of the stage. meghan hicks smiles her way to a strong stage 4. photo: kirsten kortebein melissa venables(+2:12:36) wassuperconservative through the stage. she was nearly seven minutes out of the women’s top ten… at 12km! she moved up all stage, even sneaking past jolanda briefly to move into sixth, before finishing in seventh. poorgemma game(+2:33:46) was in the unenviable position of running as the fifth of five women in the late start. she was 4 minutes behind everyone 12 kilometers into her stage. still, if you look at her splits versus all the women together, she went out “hard” and faded quiet strongly. i’d imagine she’s have felt some pressure or desire not to be running along off the back and that may have forced her hand. sussanah chan(+2:58:31) andemily foy(+2:58:31) went out harder than their previous stage finishes would have placed them, whileholly symons(+2:58:31) went out conservatively. by 38km, chan and foy had paired up and apparently worked together the rest of the stage. symons caught the pair by 75km and the trio finished together in a tie for ninth on the day. [initial women’s report] former top fivernatalia sedykhwas the first woman to cross the line today, but she started in the main field after receiving a one-hour penalty yesterday."
"the top five women and top 50 men start three hours after the main field at the mds’s long stage, so it will be a while before we know where natalia’s 12:20:29 puts her amongst those five later women’s starts today. the most recent reliable update we have on the women’s top five is that overall leaderelisabet barnesand three-time mds champlaurence kleinwere running together at 37.8km. at that point,liza howardfor just over 3 minutes back. [update a few hours later, 4:30 p.m. pst] elisabet barnes won the long stage of this year’s marathon des sables. interestingly, there aren’t any updates on either laurence klein or liza howard after the three checkpoints after 38km that are otherwise reporting online. at the same time, updates from the other two women from the top five who started in the later wave–anna-marie watson and gemma game–do have updates from later checkpoints. i don’t want to be alarmist… as i have no hard info and communication problems are inherent in such remote locations (trust me, i know! ), but it’s possible that either of these two women are having issues. two years ago, laurence klein was leading the mds women’s race when she abandoned stage 4. [update a few minutes later] the race is now reporting that anna-marie watson, also from the late (top five) start, has finished… with no report on laurence or liza. it could be that they’re just missing from the results… or there could be an entirely new race for the women’s podium at this year’s marathon des sables. women’s stage 4 results full stage 4 results. women’s overall results through stage 4 elisabet barnesis the presumptive women’s champion of this year’s marathon des sables. she’s won each of the first four stages and can now slowly jog her way to overall victory. in a topsy-turvy race, big blowups bylaurence kleinandliza howardduring the long stage, a 1-hour penalty tonatalia sedykhprior to stage 4, and, most importantly, a strong stage 4 mean thatanna-marie watsonjumped from sixth to second overall today. natalia’s third-place finish on the day moved her up into third. (she had been in fourth prior to her penalty.) these two women should battle for second in friday’s final marathon-length competitive stage. it’s worth noting that natalia has run nearly hour faster than anna-marie has on the course. if both recover well tomorrow, this could be a great battle to the finish. natalia sedykh sits as third overall woman after the long stage. photo: kirsten kortebein behind natalie, there’s an almost (certainly insurmountable) hour tomeghan hicks, who jumps up into fourth overall with her steady running on the long stage, butgemma gameis a mere five minutes behind hicks in fifth. claire morriseylook as if she should take sixth overall, whilemelissa venablesandjolanda linschootenshould battle one-another for seventh-place overall. overall rankings through stage 4.field report — from meghan hicks stage 4 – in the presence of wind have you ever run into a headwind for 45 miles? and not just a headwind, but a stiff one, blowing at 30 miles per hour or more."
"that’s what mds competitors faced in yesterday and today’s 58-mile long stage. the 2015 mds will surely go down as the year of the wind. such a hard wind that competitors worked together, drafting, all day, all night. such a hard wind that we had to lean into it. such a hard wind that our entire bodies were coated in a thick layer of dust and sand. an upside to a persistent headwind is its cooling effect. you still need just as much water to counter the sahara, but you feel less hot as you run. wind, oh, how you roll. field report — from kirsten kortebein the long stage of this year’s marathon des sables–91.7 km–succeeded in shaking up both the men’s and women’s rankings. clouds/dust covered the sun for the general classement start at 8:00 am bmt, but by the time the elite runners’ race began at 11:00 am, the heat was back in full force. the weather has been consistently windy throughout this mds, and sandstorms have been intermittent. there was a strong headwind throughout the majority of yesterday’s race. [seekirsten’s stage 4 photos.] women’s race swedeelisabet barnestook first place yet again during yesterday’s long stage; she mentioned yesterday that she thinks it takes “a couple times around to figure out this race,” proving once again that she’s got a real handle on the mds this time around. her only concern at the moment is that her shoes–she’s running in hokas, the clifton model–are collapsing a bit, and hopes they hold up. usa’sliza howardhad a tough time yesterday, dropping out of her second-place overall ranking. she started to have stomach issues circa cp5, was running on an empty stomach, and decided to lay down for 3-4 hours. after leaving cp5, she felt well until cp6, where she was unable to even keep down water. she did finish the stage a little after 7:00 am bmt, and will finish tomorrow’s stage, as well. she says that her pack is a likely cause of the vomiting…not necessarily because it was too heavy, but that its size proportional to her own body weight may have exacerbated her stomach issues. laurence kleinwould’ve been a likely candidate for third place during yesterday’s long stage, but she, too, fell far behind elisabet barnes. the mds staff have reported that laurence stopped along the way to help a runner who was having a medical issue, and waited for 45 minutes with him or her for the medical staff to arrive. she will not be receiving a “time credit” for the time spent helping the runners; regardless, this still doesn’t explain why she arrived around 4:00 am. the mds staff and myself have been unsuccessful thus far in reaching laurence for any further information. those whodidcome in second and third places were britain’sanna-marie watsonand russia’snatalia sedykh. natalia was looking very well throughout the race, and finished looking equally strong. she started the race under a 1:00 hour penalty, though."
"this penalty was levied because one of the items required for runners to carry was missing from her pack during a control. usa’smeghan hickshas moved into fourth place in the overall ranking after yesterday’s long stage. she reported having felt well until about 9.5 hours in, and then had stomach issues. men’s race rachid el morabitywas the first of the top men to cross the finish line last night after yesterday’s 91.7-kilometer stage. he came in looking strong, proud, and left us all wondering how far behind he’d left morocco’sabdelkader el mouaziz. as far as anyone at the finish line knew, rachid and el mouaziz had been running together all day; the last i’d seen them, they were blazing through cp5 together, barely stopping to get their water ration cards punched. in chatting with rachid this morning, he reported that they’d run together up until “two kilometers from the finish,” where he then pulled ahead. el mouaziz stayed focused yesterday, saying that he did feel tired during the long stage, largely due to the terrain (mountains, soft sand.) he credits his success in yesterday’s stage to having trained specifically for this stage, saying that “without strategy, [yesterday’s stage] would not have been possible.” morocco’saziz el akadhad a fantastic day yesterday, coming in third place during the stage. all the moroccan 4×4 drivers and tent personnel gathered at the finish line went nuts when they realized who was arriving, thrilled that three moroccans had just swept first, second, and third place. he’s now sitting in third-place overall, and says that he’s only continued to feel stronger throughout each stage of this mds. he made sure to stay vigilant during yesterday’s stage: not necessarily in terms of watching behind for other runners, but by calculating his food and water intake and listening to his body. this might be a good place to talk about jordan’ssalameh al aqra, who finished yesterday’s stage in eighth place, just over an hour after rachid. it left everyone at the finish line a bit confused when he didn’t come in within 15 minutes of rachid, and there was some serious confusion when 9:30 pm (mds time) rolled around and there was still no sign of him. as it turns out, he tore a muscle in his left leg on the jebel decent directly after cp1. he says he was in pain, but that he “had to finish, i didn’t care,” and continued on for the remainder of the 91.7 kilometers. “i’m used to this…i’m ten years in, you’ll always face something,” he says. he seems to have emotionally accepted the injury; if anything, he says he is disappointed that he pushed himself so hard yesterday, knowing that it was too much. his legacy of success in the mds long stage still played a big role in yesterday’s race–both rachid and el mouaziz said that the most exhausting part of their race yesterday was constantly asking themselves when salameh would arrive."
"“ninety-one kilometers is a long way to always be watching for someone to catch you,” says rachid, and noted that this constant vigilance was very stressful throughout the race. samir akhdar’ssmiling face was a great one to see as he crossed the finish line last night in fourth place. he’s worked so hard in his mds preparations this year, and has really made an effort to run his own race throughout the stages thus far. “i raced yesterday for me, for myself,” he said. “you get stressed if you don’t race alone in your mind.” a bit further back,dave mackeyof the us felt well beginning yesterday’s race, but says that he succumbed to a number of factors during the long stage. running in the midday heat was difficult for him, as the elite runners are typically finished and in camp by noon or 1:00 pm each day. he also had stomach issues throughout the first 60 kilometers of the race, and mentioned that he thinks he may have consumed too much fiber. up until the last 25% of the race, he’d run on an empty stomach. he was finally able to rebound with some peanut butter, and finished the last 20 kilometers feeling better and on-pace. additional information stage 3: jebel el otfal to jebel zireg (36.7 km) on paper, stage 3’s 23 miles look fairly benign. however, the terrain or the temps rarely leave an “easy” day as an option during the mds. at the front of the pack, the speed of today’s stage seems on par with, if a hair faster than the preceding days. we look forward to reports from the field on how the moroccan sahara challenged the 1,300 runners today. the start of stage 3. photo: kirsten kortebein women – stage 3 at the front of the women’s race, swedeelisabet barnescontinued her sweep of stage victories today. for the first time in this year’s race, frenchwomanlaurence klein(+7:18) bested the us’slisa howard(+13:42) to take second on the day. elisabet barnes on her way to winning her third-straight stage. photo: kirsten kortebein natalia sedykh(+19:33) andgemma game(+29:50) have quite the set routine at this point. natalia goes out hard (she was in second, just ahead of howard at 14km today) and gemma runs consistently (she’s been fifth woman at every checkpoint in this year’s mds except for checkpoint 1 in stage 1… she was sixth). for the third straight day, the russian and brit finished fourth and fifth, respectively, for the stage. however, natalie bested gemma by 10 minutes today as opposed to a minute or so in the two previous stages. the uk’sanna-marie watson(+36:10) ran sixth woman all day, just as she did yesterday, but remains distinctly behind natalia and gemma. [update april 8, 1 p.m. pdt: it appears that natalia sedykh recieved a 1-hour penalty yesterday. i’m awaiting additional details. – bryon] more steady racing from the uk’s gemma game in stage 3. photo: kirsten kortebein rebecca ferry(+48:24) of the uk continues to move up the women’s field."
"she was seventh today after finishing 12th in stage 1 and eighth in stage 2.jolanda linschooten(+49:24) bounced back from a rough day yesterday to finish eighth woman on the day just a minute behind ferry. the uk’smelissa venables(+50:40) bounced around the women’s field today, as she was 14th at 14km before moving into eighth by 26km. she finished ninth on the day. not far behind her was americanmeghan hicks, who steadily stayed in tenth all day. hicks reported before the race that the leg injury that kept her from running mds last yearmightprevent her from “racing” this year’s event, but not from finishing as she could run pain-free at an easy pace. her consistent placement within the women’s field during each stage suggests this may, in fact, be the case. ireland’sclaire morrissey(+1:09:19) is slowly sagging in the ranks, having gone from ninth to tenth to 11th through each of the first three stages. we’ve not noted her previously, but the uk’semily foy(+1:13:35) finished 11th in the first two stages before taking 13th today, when she was four minutes behind morrissey. women’s stage 3 results full stage 3 results. women’s overall results through stage 3 men – stage 3 three stages and three 1-2-3 finishes forrachid el morabity,abdelkader el mouaziz(+2:31), andsalameh al aqra(+4:18). however, rachid’s not pulling away early in the stages. today, the other two ran with or ahead of rachid through the first checkpoint (14km), while el mouaziz and al aqra were right with el morabity at checkpoint 2 (26km). however, rachid seems able to pull away at will at the end of each stage. tomorrow should sort things out amongst the top three… but rachid seems pretty untouchable at this point. many of the men’s contenders racing early in stage 3. photo: kirsten kortebein oh, the ever patientaziz el akad(+4:57). he seems to be filling in mohamad ahansal’s elder statesman roll up front at this year’s mds. he’s out there running by himself and getting it done that way. at 14km today, he was in fifth already two minutes off the lead. he then passedchema martínez(+8:53) and made up ground on al aqra before checkpoint 2 before settling in and taking fourth for the second-straight day. martínez, on the other hand, was once again aggressive, running with the leaders through the first checkpoint before being dropped quite hard. this is not promising for tomorrow’s upcoming long stage. akad el aziz giving chase early in stage 3. photo: kirsten kortebein the uk’sdanny kendall(+13:20) knows his place. it was seventh the first day and sixth the past two days. he went out in seventh today before passingsamir akhdar(+14:21) late in today’s stage. behind akhdar, there was a small gap to another five guys within eight minutes of one another. it appears thatdave mackey(+20:03) andchristophe le saux(+20:36) were close to one another all day before mackey put half a minute on le saux late in the stage to take eighth."
"switzerland’s marco de martin (+24:40) ran in tenth all day today after finishing eighth in stage 1 and 11th in stage 2.mohamad ahansal’s(+26:17) leg has him far outside the top five, but he continues on, taking 11th today ahead ofantoine guillon(+27:55). those two andcarlos sá(+33:31) all bounced around between 11th and 13th through the course of stage 3. sá ended up in 13th. men’s stage 3 results men’s overall results through stage 3 irunfar field report – from kirsten kortebein nearly every day in the sahara is hot, but today, it ishot. due to the severe flooding in this area of the desert throughout the last couple of months, the ground and the air hold much more moisture this year than they typically do during the mds. this has been noticeable throughout the race, but the air was especially heavy during today’s stage three. it hasn’t been markedly sunny today–in fact, it’s been fairly overcast and hazy–but everyone is feeling the effects of today’s atypical humidity. men’s race morocco’s rachid el morabity took first place again during today’s stage, followed once more by morocco’s abdelkader el mouaziz. rachid says he is feeling very “in form” and is not tired heading into tomorrow’s long stage, but he did mention that today’s heat was severe for him. he is content with his performance thus far, and hopes to continue his current rhythm during stage four. it will be interesting to see how tomorrow’s stage four shakes out for el mouaziz; he is aware that he will need to be careful not to overdo it at the beginning of the stage, and plans to find his pace behind–not with–rachid throughout tomorrow’s 91.7 kilometers. finishing today’s stage just one minute after el mouaziz was jordan’s salameh al aqra, who is in good spirits and is looking forward to tomorrow’s long stage. “[the long stage] is my day,” he says, and notes that he has a chance of moving up in his ranking if he can play it smart tomorrow. morocco’s aziz el akad finished today in fourth place, and is preparing for tomorrow’s long stage. “it will not be easy to run tomorrow,” he says, but plans to eat well tonight in preparation. chema martínez looked well coming through kilometer 8 with the front pack, but fell back as the race went on, and finished in fifth place. danny kendall and samir akhdar came in sixth and seventh today. samir acknowledges that he should’ve found his own rhythm today instead of trying to stick with the top four men, and plans to run his own race during tomorrow’s long stage, for which he feels very prepared. women’s race sweden’s elisabet barnes took first place yet again during stage three, followed today by france’s laurence klein in second place. barnes said that today was the toughest stage yet, and that she does feel tired after today."
"she mentioned that she’d started today’s race feeling almost feverish at the start line, and had been worried about her performance potential; but after a few kilometers, she regrounded and was able to take advantage of today’s flat spaces. laurence had said that she’d had a more difficult time than normal acclimating to the desert temperatures this year, but each stage seems to be finding her footing more and more. usa’s liza howard came in third today, mentioning that today’s headwind and her heavy pack made today a bit more rough. she “plugged along just fine,” though, and is meticulously planning her food timing in preparation for the long stage. russia’s natalia sedykh and britain’s gemma game took fourth and fifth places today, holding the same places respectively overall. usa’s meghan hicks finished today in tenth place, which brings her to an overall placing of seventh. additional information stage 2: oued tijekht to jebel el otfal (31.1 km) stage 2 was jebel day, with the relatively short course crossing two significant jebels (rough hills) at joua baba ali jebel and el otfal jebel. that means it was a day that favored those the strong and technical runner rather than the merely fast. a day amongst the jebels. photo: kirsten kortebein men — stage 2 while things are always far from settled until the dust has settled on the long stage, the top three men this year appear to be sorting themselves out at least for these early 20-25 miles stages.rachid el morabitywon today’s 31.1km stage in 2:32. unlike yesterday, he didn’t have anyone on his shoulder as he crossed the line asabdelkader el mouaziz(+2:54) finished nearly three minutes back in second.salamed al aqraagain took third, a bit further off el morabity, but about equidistant from yesterday’s gap back from el mouaziz. however, today al aqra did lead through the first checkpoint at 12km before fading. rachid el morabity won stage 2 of the 2015 mds. photo: kirsten kortebein in the biggest jump on the day among leaders, morocco’saziz el akad(+5:12) moved from 11th in stage 1 to fourth in stage 2. he was also only five minutes off the lead today. it appears he’ll make a play for his sixth top-five mds finish at this year’s race. samir akhdar(+11:48) anddanny kendall(+13:04) went out harder today, both within two minutes of the lead in fourth and fifth respectively at 12km. samir, who’s never finished in the top five overall at mds, ended up fifth on the day and, now, sits in fourth overall, while kendall finished about a minute behind him. both gentleman are running a strong race and anything can happen, but both also appear to have a top end a level below today’s top four. mohamad ahansal(+18:22) went out quite conservatively today. he was in 11th almost five minutes off the lead at 12km before working his way up to seventh by the finish."
"still, being 18 minutes off the lead today seems more indicative off an inability to compete with the top dogs this year rather than sound strategy for this multiple-time champ. the rest of the today’s top ten was rounded out by americans and europeans who all finished within a minute of one another.dave mackey(+20:32) andchema martínez(+20:56) both went out relatively hard in seventh and eighth through 12km. chema then pulled ahead by a few minutes by the 25km checkpoint before mackey reeled him back in to take eighth.antoine guillon(+20:47) also reeled chema in after being three minutes back at 12km and 3.5 minutes back at 25km. i’d look for antoine to continue moving up. abdelkader el mouaziz, salameh al aqra, chema martinez, and another run together early in stage 2. photo: kirsten kortebein after taking eighth yesterday,martin de marcotook 11th today.carlos sáwas stronger today, taking 12th, but he’s still not his usual self. christophe le saux dropped from ninth yesterday to 12th today. men’s stage 2 results full stage 2 results. men’s overall results through stage 2 full overall results through stage 2. women — stage 2 well, it appearselisabet barnesis more than a one-hit wonder in this year’s mds. it looks like she led stage 2 from wire to wire. however, she did give up most of her 90-second lead at 25km to edge outliza howardby a mere 16 seconds at the finish. we’re not sure whether that’s due to fatigue or the tough terrain, which included a difficult jebel as well as almost a mile of sand dunes in that final 6.5 kilometers. elisabet barnes wins her second-straight mds stage. photo: kirsten kortebein while there was some yo-yoing time wise among the top women today… each of the top eight women already held her finishing position at both checkpoints at 12 and 25 kilometers. that’s pretty remarkable. the top five women also took the same positions they did in stage 1. this may seem like a set up for a non-dynamic race… but just you wait until wednesday’s long stage. france’slaurence klein(+15:50) again immediately ceded time to barnes before finishing nearly 16 minutes off the lead. either klein has an entirely different strategy from her aggressive racing in past years or she’s just not in the fitness to win again. we’ll see come the long stage in two days. natalie sedykh(+23:40) andgemma game(+24:15) once again took fourth and fifth on the day, respectively. heck, they pretty much ran the same exact stages as each did in stage 1 with the same gaps off the lead, as well. natalie was the more aggressive of the two. she was just four minutes off the lead and 40 seconds off third-place laurence at 12km before fading. on the other hand, gemma was steady edwina through the stage, making up much ground on natalie late. anna-marie watson(+32:45) moved up a spot today to take sixth in an even effort. she swapped yesterday’s positions withmeghan hicks(+38:01), who slowed some after the first checkpoint."
"the uk’s rebecca ferry (+45:56) jumped into the top ten today after taking 12th yesterday.melissa venables(+47:50) andclaire morrissey(+50:43) swapped positions from yesterday with melissa taking ninth today as she moved up through the field during the stage. at the moment,jolanda linschootenlooks like a non-factor for the top five. after taking eighth yesterday, she was 12th today. she was over an hour off the lead today and is an hour and 45 minutes off the overall lead after two stages. women’s stage 2 results full stage 2 results. women’s overall results through stage 2 full overall results through stage 2. irunfar field report – from kirsten kortebein stage two of the 2015 marathon des sables was–as can be expected–a hot one. morale in bivouac seems high, but today’s strong sun and technical terrain seem to have tired out even some of the top competitors. stage two’s course contained multiple jebel climbs and descents on fairly loose rock, a flat oued, and small dune fields. as i write, a large sandstorm is looming–everyone here is crossing their fingers that it will pass by, but the runners are doing their best to secure their tents in preparation. women’s race elisabet barnes took first place again today in the women’s race, staying strong throughout the day. navigating the stage’s jebels seemed to have been a little more of a challenge for her, and she took a bit of a wrong turn while traversing the jebel between cp2 and the finish line. usa’s elizabeth howard, who had stuck with elisabet for the majority of today’s stage, did pull ahead at this point–but once the two had descended and entered into the small dune field before the finish, elisabet powered past howard for a strong finish. howard is cheerful post-race and had “lots of fun” during today’s stage, particularly enjoying running the ridgelines and technical downhills. france’s laurence klein came in third today and rests in third place overall. she’s staying very focused before the next stages. russia’s natalia sedykh and britain’s gemma game stuck and finished today’s stage close together–in fourth and fifth places, respectively–and britain’s anna-marie watson and usa’s meghan hicks finished in sixth and seventh. liza howard earns second during stage 2 of the 2015 mds. photo: kirsten kortebein men’s race morocco’s rachid el morabity took the win yet again during today’s stage, setting and holding a solid pace throughout the course. he is cheerful in camp but very focused, which is especially evident when he crosses the finish line. morocco’s abdelkader el mouaziz came in second today; he did indeed seem to have a harder time with today’s stage than yesterday’s, seeming tired in comparison to stage one. the top competitors consider him to be a real force to reckon with, but are predicting that the long stage may be quite difficult for him. on the other hand, jordan’s salameh al aqra is feeling very well–healthy, rested, and confident–and finished today’s race in third place. finishing behind salameh was morocco’s aziz el akad."
"he put in some serious leg work today; he seems in good spirits, and is now sitting in seventh place overall. samir akhdar said that he struggled a bit with today’s heat and technical terrain, but found his rhythm once he stopped trying to keep pace with el morabity. finishing behind samir was britain’s danny kendall, who says he had more energy during today’s race than yesterday’s, during which he had felt sluggish. mohamad ahansal’s left knee was bothering him quite a bit during the steep descents in today’s stage… he joked that he’s running this mds “with one leg.” he is staying relaxed, and will take the rest of the race as it comes. other information stage 1: jebel irhs to oued tijekht (36.2 km) stage 1 looks like a rough way to start off the marathon des sables with a few jebel (rough hill) crossings and a few kilometers of sand dunes. no matter the exact terrain, the first stage of the mds provides runners the added challenge of their packs weighing their maximum. even when the terrain is tougher later in the race, lighter packs can ease a runner’s physical and mental burden. on the upside, it was a mere 29c/85f with low humidity two hours into the first stage. while that’s hot for many northern hemisphere climes this time of year, that’s downright comfortable on the mds course. women — stage 1 holy moly! native swede and uk-residentelisabet barnesblazed the women’s field to kick off the 2015 marathon des sables. she finished the 36km stage nearly eight minutes ahead the next woman, the us’s liza howard. barnes had a minute lead at the race’s first checkpoint at 13km, built that to four minutes by 25km, before adding another four minutes on the women’s field in the final 11km. barnes has some strong ultra results in the uk, but from the (very) outside, it looks like this was a very aggressive first-stage performance when you compare barnes’s marathon times in the 3 hours and teens over the past few years with the with pedigrees the likes of liza howard’s and laurence klein’s. elisabet barnes on her way to winning stage 1. photo: kirsten kortebein liza howard(+7:57) did take second on the day, but after running through the first two checkpoints at 13 and 25 kilometers roughly a minute behind multiple-time championlaurence klein(+10:40) of france. either howard kicked hard or klein faded late, as howard outran klein by 4 minutes in the final 11 kilometers today. two more new names,natalia sedykh(+23:16) of russia andgemma game(+24:54) of the uk, rounded out the women’s top five in stage one. natalie hung with then third-place howard through checkpoint 1 at 13 km and was still within 7 minutes of the women’s lead at 25km. she would finish 23 minutes back. gemma ranmuchmore evenly that natalia, as she was 10 minutes off the lead at 13km, 18 minutes off at 25km, and 25 minutes at the finish. that promises to be a much better long term strategy."
"meghan hicks(+36:19), the 2013 mds champion ran evenly through the day. she finished sixth woman 36 minutes off the lead with the sort of even effort we’d expect out of meghan. the uk’sanna-marie watson(+44:49) moved up a great deal through the stage, from 14th at 13km to seventh at the finish. meghan hicks during stage 1. photo: kirsten kortebein of otherwomen we previewed before the race,jolanda linschooten(+45:43) of the netherlands was eighth on the day after going out in 5th through 13km, while ireland’sclaire morrissey(+46:46′) finished in ninth, the position she held most of the stage. at this point italy’sluisa balsamoand spain’seli sanchez britolook to be non-competitive in this venture. full women’s results from stage 1. men — stage 1 yeah… the moroccans. they, along with mds regularsalameh al aqraof jordan, crushed the first stage of the 2015 marathon des sables, with four moroccans and salameh taking five of the top six positions and leaving a slew of international-caliber ultrarunners from 20 to 35 minutes back… in a 35-kilometer stage. wow! last year’s champrachid el morabityedged out countrymanabdelkader el mouazizby 15 seconds after being within seconds of one another throughout the stage. rachid obviously has the power to continue this effort, while abdelkader (a former 2:06 marathoner) similarly saw success in the “shorter” mds stages last year before losing over 2 hours to the leaders on the much longer stage four. rachid el morabity edging out countryman abdelkader el mouaziz for the stage 1 win. photo: kirsten kortebein having finished mds nine times, won the mds in 2012, and oft running in similar terrain in his jordanian homeland, it’s no surprise to have salameh al aqra (+3:08) finish third on the day. a three-minute deficit is an irrelevant rounding error at this point in mds. still, it could be telling that he was with the two leaders through at least 25km before falling back late in the stage.chema martínez(+5:39) of spain was the top european on the day. a former track and road running star (2:08 marathon), we’ll have to see if chema can sustain this sort of performance or if he’ll fall more in line with adbelkader’s 2014 performance. moroccan friendssamir akhdarandmohamad ahansal(both +7:30) ran together all day to take fifth and sixth. with five mds wins, mohamad knows what he’s doing and samir is smart to stick with him. samir akhdar and mohamad ahansal finishing stage 1 side-by-side. photo: kirsten kortebein and then there was a 10 minute gap. the uk’sdanny kendall(+17:01) led the mortals with his seventh place finish on the day with an even effort. switzerland’smarco de martin(+20:01) moved up the field through the day to take eighth. de martin traded places late in the race withchristophe le saux(+21:24) of france, who also ran a well-paced stage.dave mackey(+22:54) of the us stayed roughly in the same spot all day before finishing in tenth. stage one left some notable runners outside the top ten.aziz el akad(+23:07) of morocco could only manage 11th, while having finished between second and fifth in all five of his mds finishes."
"i was surprised to seeantoine guillon(+23:52) of france back in 12th after day 1, although his talents are much better suited for the long stage on day 4. perhaps the biggest surprise on the day is portugal’scarlos sá(+35:18) finishing more than 35 minutes off the lead in 15th. sá was fourth at last year’s mds. full men’s results from stage 1. rachid el morabity in the bivouac the day before the 2015 mds. photo: cimbaly/e. sampers (c) mds2015 irunfar field report – from kirsten kortebein after a prep day filled with dust and reoccurring sandstorms, the 30th marathon des sables is finally underway. the competitors left base camp this morning a little after 9:00 am bmt (the mds has, like last year, opted to create an “mds time zone” instead of staying on local time.) today’s stage was 36.2 km, and included a solid range of terrain: flat rocky areas, a dried up oued, jebels, and small dune fields. men’s race jordan’s salameh al aqra led the pack through cp1, jostling for position with morocco’s abdelkader el mouaziz and spain’s josé manuel martinez. morocco’s rachid el morabity and mohamad ahansal followed quickly but calmly behind, with a smiling samir akhdar bringing up the rear. the front pack stayed relatively close together throughout the remainder of the stage; rachid was ultimately the first to cross the finish line, looking calm and calculated despite morocco’s el mouaziz finishing just seconds behind him. salameh came in third today, crossing the finish line with his trademark unfurling of the jordanian flag. in fourth place, with a strong finish was spain’s martinez, who looked confident and happy throughout and at completion of this first stage. finishing thereafter were samir akhdar and mohamad ahansal, britain’s danny kendall, switzerland’s marco de martin, france’s christophe le saux, and usa’s dave mackey. women’s race first across the finish line in the women’s race was sweden’s elisabet barnes, who finished today’s 36.2 km in 3h:45m:17s. barnes felt strong through cp1 and cp2, but had a harder time from cp2 until the finish, largely due to the heat. eight minutes behind elisabet was usa’s elizabeth howard, who crossed the finish line looking serious but strong. coming in third today was france’s laurence klein, who finished minutes after howard. finishing fourth was russia’s natalia sedykh, and fifth was the uk’s gemma game. irunfar field report – from meghan hicks[added april 7, 6 p.m. mdt]there is simply no other place i’d like to be, late afternoon in the middle of the mds bivouac. the heat of the day has yielded to the long shadows and cooler breeze of evening, runners streaming across the line still, a cornucopia of languages being spoken in every direction. we ran 36 kilometers today and though the heat and sand and sun beset us and though we’re limited to only the food in our packs, we are still fresh and peppy in our meanderings through camp. this morning, we awoke to a near­full moonset, and, tonight, we’ll be treated to a full­moon rise as the sun goes down."
"the bivouac reaches a half mile or more through the mountain-­filled valley in which we will tonight reside. life is simple in the mds, we have little and yet we need even less. it is good, no it is great and noble, the mds. tomorrow brings another day and a promise of only more. we will run, we will seek, we will find. additional information – stage 1 related articles:"

"after that, he, too, slowly worked his way through the men’s field. didrik used the long descent following the course high point to pass a couple more people, pushing into second place, which he then held through the finish. what a breakout day for didrik! didrik hermansen running his way toward second place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell france’santoine guillon(post-race interview) ran a bit more aggressively as compared to the other two men on the podium. by 30k, he was already into the top 10, where he would stay all day. like didrik, antoine used the long downhill between 85k and 100k to put the hammer down on some other guys who were suffering, making his way into that final podium spot. antoine guillon making his way to the bottom of the long, late-race downhill. photo: irunfar/bryon powell sondre amdahl, after his hot early pace in the lead group and in the lead, slowed, regrouped, and soldiered on to fourth place. france’scyril cointrerounded out the top five. the u.s.’santon krupicka(pre-race interview) was in the hunt for almost the entire race. though he ran, at times, in the back half of the top 10, he was only minutes off the podium. he climbed as high as fourth place right around the race’s high point at pico de las nieves. but the late-race heat sapped his strength, and he slowed significantly in the final marathon, yielding a couple spots to finish sixth.remi queral(spain),freddy thevenin(france),marco zanchi(italy), andpiotr hercog(poland) rounded out the men’s top 10. full results (pdf). when spain’snúria picashas a good day, her mo is to start a bit conservative, and let other women do the early leading. today was no different. early speedsters and france countrymatesemilie lecomteandcaroline chaverotfilled that role. while emilie would withdraw, perhaps succumbing to that hot pace, caroline persevered on, slowing but not by too much. by 30k into the race, núria had taken the lead, a spot she wouldn’t relinquish even though there were some 95k’s of racing still to do. she steadily built an almost-30-minute gap over the ladies field, then lost about 12 or 14 minutes of that buffer, then built part of it back again by the finish. we could see that, at times, her effort was a grinding, uncomfortable one, but her overall strength shone through today. núria picas, 2015 transgrancanaria champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell second place caroline chaverot (post-race interview) suffered some mid-race stomach issues, perhaps related to her flying start. but once she got in control of those, she held steady in her podium spot. i’m not sure what was more fascinating to watch in caroline today: her early confidence or her later regrouping and strength. caroline chaverot, who would eventually finish second. photo: irunfar/bryon powell okay, we admit that, by the way china’sdong li(post-race interview) was looking with 25k to go, we weren’t sure she would finish. she was hot and exhausted, in fourth position after running most of the race in the back half of the women’s top five."
"but if there’s anything we know about ultrarunning, it’s that revivals happen all the time, and her late-race performance was certainly one. not only did she revive enough to finish, but she also climbed onto the podium and finished third. really impressive, dong! dong li, 2015 transgrancanaria third place. photo: irunfar/bryon powell switzerland’sandrea huserran in third place for most of the race. but in the race’s final 25k, she slowed some, allowing for dong li to pass her. brazil’smanu vilasecarounded out the women’s top five. manu’s race was another well-played one. she ran in the back half of the top 10 for more than the majority of the race, and then squeaked into the top five by staying strong late in the race as others slowed. spain’sester alvestook sixth, portugal’slucinda sousawas seventh, the u.s.’saliza lapierre(pre-race interview) was eighth, spain’sraquel rivero delgadowas ninth, and spain’ssilvia triguerosruns to 10th. full results (pdf). articles and photo galleries coming soon. race reports thank you to ian campbell, miguelito rodriguez, travis trampe, nick pedatella, ellie greenwood, mauri pagliacci, and andy jones-wilkins for their assistance in the field and office in bringing our live transgrancanaria coverage! related articles:"

"like her men’s-champion counterpart, hong kong’swyan chowwent out steady and kept her pace all day. in the first half of the race, she toyed around with positions inside the top five. like steady clockwork, she moved into second position before 36k and the lead position by 65k. from then on, she maintained a moderate and successful separation from the rest of the women’s field. her 12:34:56 represents the third-fastest time run on this course. last fall, wyan set a local record by being the first woman to run under 13 hours on a mixed team at the oxfam trailwalker 100k, a famous and longstanding hong kong team ultramarathon. clearly, her upward trajectory is just getting going. pui-yan wyan chow, 2015 vibram hong kong 100k women’s champion. photo: irunfar/koichi iwasa china’sdong liwas the most aggressive (but in the end still successful) runner of the day. she ran off the front from the get go, setting herself minutes apart from the other women through the 65k point where she was overtaken by eventual winner pui-yan. from there, though dong had lapsed to second, she stayed with it and no other woman could touch her heavy-duty effort. she’s another new trail ultrarunner, but it seems like we’ll be seeing more of her. dong li flies to second place. photo: irunfar/koichi iwasa lisa borzani, of italy, rounded out the women’s podium. if dong had the most aggressive performance, then lisa had the most consistent. though the women in front of and behind her shifted, she stayed in the third position through every race checkpoint except the first. though she did have to fight off a late-race surge by fourth placemarie mcnaughton, who is new zealander living in hong kong and who finished just 25 seconds back, she held onto that podium spot.nicole laufinished in fifth place. lisa borzani, 2015 vibram hong kong 100k third place. photo: irunfar/koichi iwasa full results. articles and photo galleries race reports thank you thank you so much to koichi iwasa ofdogsorcaravanwho made our live coverage of the hong kong 100k possible! related articles:"

"the lottery for the 2015western states 100was held today, confirming the vast majority of next year’s field, including a few elites. however, most elites either secured entry prior to the lottery or will do so in the coming months. let’s start with those who already have entry. the wser website hasa full list of the 2015 western states 100 entrants. (initially, this list will contain pre-lottery entrants only, and it will populate with the entire field in the coming days.) the women’s top 10 from this yearare invitedto return in 2015. everyone one from last year’s women’s top 10, with the exception of france’s nathalie mauclair, who finished third, will return for the race’s 2015 edition. the men’s top 10 from 2014are also invitedto return. like the women, nine of last year’s top-10 men plan to be back in 2014. the single non-returner is max king, who finished in fourth place. a few top international runners gained entry via theforeign resident – special considerationroute. among these are julien chorier, of france, who won hardrock in 2011 and took second this year, and who is a multi-time winner of the diagonale des fous. a stellar addition to the field is france’s françois d’haene, who in the last couple of years has moved into world-domination mode at the longer ultramarathon distances. included in this passel of victories for 2014 are wins at the ultra-trail mount fuji, ultra-trail mount-blanc, and diagonale des fous. lithuania’s gedimimius grinius has surged onto the global scene this year with a fifth place at utmb and a fourth at diagonale des fous. several other top-10 contenders gained entry via anotherautomatic entryroute: a total of 273 names were drawn during today’s lottery, and among them were a small number of high-level athletes: top runners still have two routes by which they can gain entry into the 2015 western states 100: montrail ultra cup up to 20 runners will be able to run their way in at the following 2015montrail ultra cupraces: at each race, up to two men and two women will be awarded spots. a change was made to the 2015 montrail ultra cup from the previous year; through 2014, 30 spots were awarded to western states through the muc, but for this year, only 20 spots will be awarded. after the announcement of the 2015 montrail ultra cup, western states 100 race director craig thornley previously explained to irunfar how the extra 10 spots would be distributed in 2015: “five of those entries have been reabsorbed into the standard ws100 lottery process to be applied to all applicants, and five will be allocated to sponsor use to be outlined later. so stay tuned for that announcement later.” western states president tim twietmeyer announced today at the lottery that the five additional spots will be awarded to runners entered in the lottery who run one of the five montrail ultra cup races. each race will conduct a drawing to determine the one runner from their race to be granted an entry."

"congrats to everyone who gained entrance to the elusive 2015hardrock hundred endurance run. let’s be clear, hardrock isn’t a race, per se. it’s a ‘run.’ but it’s one of the hardest and most aesthetic organized 100-mile ‘runs’ on this planet. so attractive is this run that 1,367 people applied for the lottery for the 2015 run, up from 1,279 folks for the 2014 run lottery. prior to the lottery, the run administration placed all of the lottery applicants in divisions based upon their previous experience (or not) with hardrock and separate lotteries took place within each of the divisions. the divisions are ‘first-timers’ from which 47 spots in the run were given, ‘veterans’ from which 35 spaces were given, and ‘everyone else’ from which 70 spaces were given. this totals 152 runners, a 12-runner increase from the 2014 race which originates from 12 more spots being given to ‘first-timers’ than last year. even though this event is called a run and not a race, there are some men and women each year who attempt to run the course faster than everyone else in that year’s run and, possibly, faster than the course record. below we document the men and women who were selected in the lottery today who we think will be the main 2015 contenders. we also mention who is on a waitlist and might get in, who is on a waitlist so far down they probably won’t get in, and who the unlucky, un-chosen runners were. the excitement on the men’s side certainly comes from returning champion and course record holder,kilian jornet, going head-to-head againstiker karrera,adam campbell, andanton krupicka. potential party spoilers includechris priceandtroy howard,both of whom have run well here in recent history. throw in a fitjason koop(dnf from hypothermia in ’14, high enough on a waitlist that he’ll probably get in) and seasoned veterans such asscott jaime,jared campbell, andkarl meltzer(also high enough on a waitlist that he’ll probably get in), and this race will be as fast and competitive as last year. on the women’s side, three-time championdarcy piceuwill be challenged by hardrock veteran and last year’s runner-up,betsy kalmeyer, as well as a fast and hungryanna frost, who blasted through her first 100 miler this fall with a win and course record at the bear 100. this duo, combined with consistent hr performerdarla askew, four time winnerdiana finkel(currently waitlisted but with a good shot of getting in), as well asbethany lewis(also waitlisted but potentially low enough that she might not get in) who is undefeated at the 100-mile distance, and the women’s race should provide just as much drama as the men’s. here we go! there’s only one way to bypass the lottery to get into hardrock: by winning the previous edition! 2014 winnerskilian jornetanddarcy piceuhave automatic entries into the 2015 run and both of them have chosen to use those entries."
"here are the high-level men who have a spot in the 2015 run: here are the high-level women who have a spot in the 2015 run: here are the male contenders who were chosen in the top-20 slots of the first-timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the everyone else waitlist. these men have a good shot of getting off their respective waitlists and into the run. here are the female contenders who were chosen in either the top-20 slots of the first-timers waitlist, the top-15 slots of the veterans waitlist, or the top-30 slots of the everyone else waitlist. these women have a decent shot of running. here are some fast men who weren’t chosen in the lottery or are so far down their respective waitlist that there is almost no chance of them getting in. there are also a bunch of fast women who entered the lottery, but have little to no chance of running hardrock in 2015. related articles:"

"pese a que nathalie mauclair fue la que tomó las riendas de la carrera temprano, no paso mucho tiempo hasta que núria se encontró con el liderato, que sostuvo hasta el segundo tercio de carrera. cuando la vimos en los primeros avituallamientos, tales como lac combal a los 64k, estaba muy, muy seria, a diferencia de la calma que lleva siempre cuando compite. parecía estar en un serio trabajo mental desde el principio. luego del primer tercio de carrera, rory recuperó su liderato y lo mantuvo. cabe destacar que, si bien núria no pudo competir con el talento y la conducción de rory de la jornada, si se apartó del resto del lote, finalizando casi una hora delante del resto de las mujeres. ella es la dama de honor de la utmb una vez más, que igualmente es una posición fantástica. núria en la floria, justo antes de finalizar tnf utmb 2014. foto: irunfar/kirsten kortebein siempre es un placer ver competir a nathalie mauclair. usualmente comienza de forma agresiva y se mantiene así lo mucho que pueda. hoy no fue diferente. a pesar de haber corrido en liderato o en segundo lugar en una parte de la carrera, cayó al tercer lugar, que ocuparía hasta el final de la competencia. nathalie mauclair, tercer lugar en the north face ultra-trail du mont-blanc 2014. foto: irunfar/meghan hicks con un desempeño muy sólido,fernanda macielyuxue frailecerraron el top cinco. del sexto al 10º lugar estuvieronildiko wermescher,andrea huser,ester alves,emily richards-chisolm, yshona stephenson. related articles:"

(the course was changed a bit from last year to this year–made a little harder–so race director karl meltzer set the course-record prime at 5:15, some six-plus minutes faster than sage’s 5:08 and change course record from last year. sage got under that magic 5:15 number.) sage canaday, 2014 speedgoat 50k champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell the race for the rest of the podium was an exciting one between eventual second placepaul hamiltonand third placealex nichols. early in the race, paul and alex mixed it up with a couple guys who would later fall back in the rankings. by mile 14.8 at the pacific mine aid station, alex and paul showed up second and third, with a small gap behind them to the rest of the field. the pair quickly separated themselves from the rest of the field and begin a duel that would continue to the finish."
"alex led paul by a couple minutes through the mile 22.3 aid station, but then paul ate away at that such that he was only 15 seconds behind atop the final climb of the day, at the hidden peak 2 aid station, mile 26. on the final, five-mile downhill, paul made the pass and finished second by just over two minutes over alex. what a race within a race! paul hamilton finishing second. photo: irunfar/bryon powell alex nichols working it on the first climb on his way to third place. photo: irunfar/nate smith fourth placerickey gatesplayed it cool all day, rolling through the early aid stations in the back half of the top 10 with a calm, collected look on his face. he then was 10th at mile 8.3 and just out of the top 10 at mile 14.8. and then the magic happened: sixth place at mile 19.4, fifth place at mile 26, and fourth place at the finish. i don’t know if it’s what he intended, but from the outside looking in, rickey’s race seemed like a perfectly calculated, planned one. mike wolfe’s fifth place was another smartly run outing. on the first climb to mile 8.3 at hidden peak, mike was nowhere to be seen inside the top 10, letting all the eager bucks go ahead. but by the almost-halfway aid station at pacific mine, he’d crept inside the top 10 where he would only move up, looking stronger and more confident than the other guys around him. locallars kjerengtroenhad a heckuva day, finishing sixth and improving massively upon his 11th place here last year. like rickey gates and mike wolfe, he, too, lingered outside of the top 10 until the long climb out of the pacific mine aid station, the rough halfway point. we’re not sure what happened back there, but lars catapulted himself from about 15th place to seventh place within miles. once he found his way to that spot, he would stay and finish that way, representing the wasatch front running community well. the arizona racing contingent told us to watch out forcatlow shipek, and they were right. again, in what seemed like a calculated race, catlow started things off easy, found his way into the top 10 in the middle of the race, and ran strong to stay there. what a solid showing on the national stage for catlow today in his seventh-place finish! eighth, ninth, and 10th places belong tojustin yates,galen burrell, andtom goth. full results. anna frost ran away with the win today, but she clearly had to work for it. she took the first-climb $1,000 prime, arriving to hidden peak at mile 8.3 with a more-than-2.5-minute lead. she said that all the women were running easy on the climb, and so she decided to go for the cash. anna frost, 2014 speedgoat 50k champion. photo: irunfar/bryon powell on the long descent from mile 8.3 to mile 14.8, eventual second place kasie enman caught up to and passed anna, where she then led into the pacific mine aid station by a small margin."
