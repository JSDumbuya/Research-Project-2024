iRunFar:Sarah Brady of iRunFar. I’m here just after the finals of the 2024Mountain Running World Cupwith women’s championScout Adkin.Scout, how are you doing?
Scout Adkin:Good, thank you.
iRunFar:Congratulations.
Adkin:Thank you.
iRunFar:What a weekend you’ve had.
Adkin:Yeah, it’s been a bit of a whirlwind and just a big relief as well at the moment, and hopefully I’ll have a bit of time now to process it all and have a rest. [laughs]
iRunFar:Yeah, well deserved. So, you came into this weekend in second place, and you’d only just moved up from third place a week before that, so it’s been a bit of a whirlwind end of season. Did you see this coming at all, to make it the whole way to the top?
Adkin:I knew it was going to be very tight. I think I hadn’t done enough races coming into this weekend for the full series yet, so I could still gain some points, although I knowJoyce[Muthoni Njeru]was able to then get rid of some of her worst results, so it was quite literally down to the wire today by one point in the end. So yeah, very close.
iRunFar:Yeah, so I guess you had no spare races, so they had to all be good.
Adkin:Yeah, yeah. [laughs]
iRunFar:And they were, so that’s great. And then just first of all to talk about yesterday, so you won the VK by a comfortable enough margin for such a short race. You won by 30-something seconds?
Adkin:Yeah, I think so. Something like that.
iRunFar:Great, and you looked to be just really at ease towards the end of that race. How did it feel?
Adkin:Yeah, it’s such a great course, and yeah, I just managed to get into a really good rhythm, and obviously with it being a time trial as well, you have absolutely no idea where your finishing position is until everyone’s finished really. So, my aim was basically to, I started second last, so I knewPhilaries [Jeruto Kisang]was just behind me, so my first aim was for her not to catch me. And then basically just trying to catch as many people ahead of me as I could really. And it worked out fine.
iRunFar:And do you think you like that format? Do you think it’s kind of good mentally?
Adkin:Yeah, it’s definitely different to a mass start. I think it’s a good test mentally as well. You’ve got to be seriously strong in yourself and your own abilities, and maybe because I do quite a lot of my training on my own, I’m kind of fairly used to solo running quite a lot of the time anyway. So, for me it was maybe a bit, I wouldn’t say easier, but I’m a bit more used to that environment.
iRunFar:You have to really be able to trust your own pacing.
Adkin:Yeah, definitely.
iRunFar:Okay, and then just to talk about today. So not a whole lot of elevation in that course, it was only about 850 meters of climb. There was a good bit of road. It was just very fast. How did you find all that?
Adkin:Yeah, tough. I mean, I was pretty much on the limit for the whole way, descending as well. I would have personally preferred a bit more climb and a bit less descending, but yeah, I knew, particularly the Kenyans, they’ve just got a lot of speed. It was a lot of fast running, and adding some quite technical little bits of descent in there as well. It was definitely a challenging course, and I had to sort of push from the start, really.
iRunFar:There seemed to be a lot of little turns as well. Did you find it was kind of hard to get in a flow with it?
Adkin:Yeah, definitely, particularly through some of the villages and things that we passed through, and then even on the trails as well. Some of them are very… even the flatter uphill sections were quite technical and very narrow. There were a couple of times I slightly slipped my footing, and you know, you could be down a sheer rock face. So yeah, definitely mentally had to be paying attention the whole time.
iRunFar:You seem to maintain position for a lot of it. Were you kind of in third the whole way through?
Adkin:I started leading the first climb, and then very quickly on the first descent, Joyce and Philaries got ahead of me, but pretty much from there on in, I was only within a second or two behind Philaries the whole rest of the way. So, it was basically keep her back in sight and don’t let her get ahead, and hope no one else was finishing very quick behind me.
iRunFar:Yeah, I saw that towards the end. You were so close together. That must have been very intense.
Adkin:Yeah, I think for me, it’s probably easier chasing than being chased, but yeah, it was still very, very tough.
iRunFar:And then as regards the overall series, you won by a single point. So had you done the maths going into today’s race? Did you know what you needed to do to win the series, or did you just see at the end what happened?
Adkin:Yeah, I mean, you kind of don’t want to think too much about the outcome. You want to just focus on the race, but yeah, my partner yesterday had kind of done the maths, and I was just praying it was right, those calculations. So thankfully they were. I knew it was going to be very tight, and anything can go wrong on that sort of course. You just basically, I was just hoping to have, you know, the best run I could really on that.
iRunFar:Okay, brilliant. And then, what’s next? Are you back to work tomorrow, or do you have a break?
Adkin:Yes, early flight tomorrow, and then yeah, back at work. But yeah, a rest now from running for a bit. A bit of downtime, and just kind of process the year. And then obviously get your plans in for over winter, and what you aim for next year as well. So yeah, I haven’t really thought past this weekend.
iRunFar:Yeah, I think that’s fair enough. You deserve a little bit of time now to regroup.
Adkin:Yeah, thanks.
iRunFar:Okay, well congratulations again, and thank you so much.
Adkin:Thank you.

iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m withPatrick Kipngeno.It’s the day of the 2024Mountain Running World CupFinals and you are the series champion.Hongera sana.Congratulations.
Patrick Kipngeno:Thank you, thank you.
iRunFar:How are you feeling? You have had two races in a row, two big races in a row.
Kipngeno:Yeah, I’m feeling great. I thank God because I wasn’t expecting that I am going to win today’s race, but I am happy because I won today’s race.
iRunFar:A quick question about yesterday’s race. You took third in the vertical kilometer uphill. How did you feel during that race? Were you taking it easy to save yourself for today?
Kipngeno:No, yesterday, you know, I’m good in uphill, so I was trying to push very hard, but unfortunately I become for position three, and I was happy for being position three.
iRunFar:And then after yesterday’s race, how did you feel? Did you feel like you were going to be able to recover enough for today?
Kipngeno:Yes, I tell myself that I have to compete and I want to be in the podium side. For me, I was saying that I want to be in the podium side.
iRunFar:Coming into this weekend as the leader in the Mountain Running World Cup series, did you feel pressure to make sure to hold on to that first-place position?
Kipngeno:No, I was not having any pressure.
iRunFar:No pressure. And then how did today feel? How was the race course for you?
Kipngeno:The race was very tactical, and I knew in the beginning that we were having a very big name in the crowd, and I tell myself that I want to be in the podium and I was not having any pressure.
iRunFar:Amazing. The men’s race went back and forth for the lead for a long time. I think it wasn’t until the last few kilometers that you took over the lead ultimately. Tell us about that moment.
Kipngeno:When we were in around 17, 18 kilometers, I was at my side, I was saying that I want to be in the podium and then reaching 20 kilometers, there was a junction where we got a bit lost there. Then we come back and we started running very fast toward the finishing line.
iRunFar:And you had a look of relief at the finish line. Is that how you felt?
Kipngeno:Yeah, yeah. I was very happy to become a champion.
iRunFar:Champion of this race, champion of the 2024 Mountain Running World Cup. Now next weekend is the Golden Trail World Series Finals. You compete again there?
Kipngeno:Yeah, I will be there, and I’m going to fight to be in the podium side also.

2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals Trail Race Results: Kipngeno and Adkin Win Series,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-mountain-running-world-cup-finals-trail-race-results,"The 2024Mountain Running World Cupfinished with a pair of competitive races in northern Italy. The Saturday, October 12 vertical kilometer (VK) race and the Sunday, October 13 trail race marked the end of this year’s 12-race series that spanned seven countries.
It was a fitting end. Kenya’sPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andJoyce Muthoni Njeruwon the race, while Kipngeno and the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) won the series. Kipngeno and Adkin earned €5,000 for their world cup wins, part of a €30,000 prize purse that paid money 10 deep.

Kenya’sJosphat Kiprotich(Kenya), this year’s Sierre-Zinal fourth-placer, pushed to an early lead, but with five kilometers to go, France’sThéodore Kleinwas an even bigger surprise leader. The 29-year-old Klein ran Sierre-Zinal this year too, finishing 205th.
Call that a bad day, though; his better results include a third at this year’s European Off-Road Championships and a sub-30 minute 10,000-meter run as recently as 2021. Klein greatly outperformed that Sierre-Zinal result here.

Series leaderPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was right with Klein though, and Kipngeno was able to pull away over the race’s closing stages. Kipngeno won the race in 1:34:03, and won the series too. He was third in yesterday’s VK race as part of the weekend double.

Kipngeno raced seven times in the world cup this year. He won both Broken Arrow races at the start of the season, and won the Vertical Nasego and Trofeo Nasego races in Italy too as part of the world cup. He’s currently ranked second in the Golden Trail World Series ahead of that series’s final next weekend in Switzerland.

The women’s race looked a lot like so many other shorter trail races this year. Kenya’sJoyce Muthoni Njeruwent to the front early and led for a lot of it. She finished in 1:47:45, just over a minute better than everyone else. It wasn’t enough to seal the series win though, as she narrowly lost out to the previous day’s winner,Scout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) of the U.K.

2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals VK Results: Adkin and Elia Fastest to Top,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-mountain-running-world-cup-finals-vk-results,"After 10 races across seven countries, the 2024Mountain Running World Cupwraps up with a pair of finals on back-to-back days in Italy. Up first, theKilometro Verticale Lagùncran on Saturday, October 12, where the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Italy’sAndrea Eliaemerged as uphill champions.
TheWorld Mountain Running Championshipshappen every other year. The event was contested last year in Austria and will happen again in 2025 in Spain. Absent a world championships event in 2024, the Mountain Running World Cup Finals take on greater importance this year. The World Mountain Running Association administers both.
A true vertical kilometer (VK), the uphill race gained 1,000 meters over 3.3 kilometers in distance. With a history dating back to 1986, it is the oldest VK race in the world. The course took runners from Chiavenna to Lagùnc, Italy, and was run in a time-trial format with runners sprinting from the start every 15 seconds. It was a cool morning with some rain and mist, making for fine conditions, if a little bit slippery on some sections of the course.
Finally, this VK served as the 2024 Italian VK National Championships, which brought some additional competition.
Many of the runners doubled back on Sunday, October 13, to run theVal Bregaglia Trailrace to conclude the series. Read ourresults articlefor that full race story.
Thanks to the World Mountain Running Association for supporting iRunFar’s 2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals coverage.

In all, the women’s field’s start was spread over 46 minutes, and the top women started at the back of the field. World cup series leaderJoyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya) went third to last, and was followed from the start line by the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Kenya’sPhilaries Kisang Jeruto(pre-race interview). Adkin and Kisang, Muthoni Njeru’s chief rivals in the series, were ranked second and third in the world cup before the race.

Further up in the start order, nearly 30 minutes before Muthoni Njeru started,Paola Stampanoni(Switzerland) was greatly outrunning her start position and passed more women than anyone else on her race to the top. In September, Stampanoni was second at the Skyrunning World Championships Vertical race.

The time-trial format makes finish ranks uncertain to spectators at the top, but both Adkin and Jeruto Kisang ran down favorite Muthoni Njeru and hit the high-point finish comfortably ahead of the series leader.
Adkin won the race in 37:57, ahead of Jeruto Kisang’s 38:35. Adkin had a commanding 38-second lead when the finish times flashed. It was Adkin’s third world cup win of the year, on top of a strong second-place finish at Sierre-Zinal this year.

Always on the podium, Jeruto Kisang had to settle for just that, another podium finish. Her runner-up spot matched last year’s silver medal at the 2023 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race.
Stampanini’s surprise early-in-the-race 39:13 split held up as third best.
Series leader and 2024 star across both the Mountain Running World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series, Muthoni Njeru was just fifth on the day in 39:55. That was, however, enough for her to hold onto her world cup series lead heading into the next day final race.

The men were second to challenge the mountain. The first man left the start line at 10:01 a.m. and another followed every 15 seconds clear up through 11:43 a.m. As with the women, the top men went last. The world cup series leader, Kenya’sPatrick Kipngeno(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), started fourth to last.
The U.S.’sJoseph Gray(pre-race interview), as with Kipngeno, a former uphill world champion, was seventh to last, and second in the world cup rankings. Kenya’sPhilemon Kiriago(pre-race interview), was ninth to last at the start line. As with the women’s race, there was rain and mist alternately throughout, making for wet terrain on the climb.
Italy’s Andrea Elia, the 2024 Kilometro Verticale Lagunc champion, which was part of the Mountain Running World Cup Finals. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks
The world cup has been dominated by Kenyan runners this year, and the country had six runners in the field. At the finish, though, it was the host country that starred. Italy placed four runners inside the top seven.
When the race organizers laid out this start order, somehow they absolutely nailed it.
Just fifth at last week’s 2024 Šmarna Gora race in Slovenia,Andrea Elia(Italy) started the race second to last.Henri Aymonod(Italy), an uphill powerhouse who won last year’s race here, went last from the starting line.

Those two ran down Kipngeno, all the other Kenyan runners, Gray, and everyone else in front of them. Elia hit the top after 31:08 and Aymonod was only seven seconds behind in 31:15. Italy thus stood atop both the gold- and silver-medal podium positions.
Kipngeno, last year’s World Mountain Running Uphill Champion, was third in 31:50. As with Muthoni Njeru in the women’s race, that did score enough points to still lead the overall series heading into the next day’s final race on October 13.

Christian Allenled the U.S. in ninth at 33:09, and Gray was 19th in 34:22.
World cup series #2, Kiriago, was just 12th in the race in 33:38.
Women’s winner Scout Adkin’s brother,Jacob Adkin(U.K.), was 17th in the men’s race in 34:14.

iRunFar:Sarah Brady of iRunFar. I’m here just a couple of days before the 2024Mountain Running World CupFinals in Chiavenna, Italy. And I’m here withPhilaries Jeruto Kisang. How are you?
Philaries Jeruto Kisang:I’m fine.
iRunFar:Great. It’s great to meet you. I know you’ve just arrived, and you went straight to this interview, so thanks so much for making the time. You have raced here before. You were here last year, and you won both these races, the VK and the long trail. So how does it feel to come back as the reigning champion?
Jeruto Kisang:I won this race last year, both the vertical and the up and down, and this year I need to become position one in vertical. I know I noticed this year in all Europe, there are many, many, many, many runners, so I thank Run2gether for allowing me to come to this vertical and all the races.
iRunFar:Ok, and is the vertical your priority? You’re doing both races, but is the vertical more important to you?
Jeruto Kisang:The most important for me is vertical, and up and down … is somehow good.
iRunFar:It’s just an extra. To rewind, we’ve never interviewed you before, so I’d love to know about your background in running. So, I know you grew up in Kenya. When did you start running, as a child or later in life?
Jeruto Kisang:I will continue with running and until next year I will improve all. Both vertical and the up and down. Yes.
iRunFar:Ok, and have you run for many years before?
Jeruto Kisang:I started running for 2022, and for world cup, I ran between 2023 and 2024, and I will continue running again.
iRunFar:Ok, so it was all mountain running. You did no road running beforehand?
Jeruto Kisang:No running before.
iRunFar:Ok, just straight in. I like it. Last year you had an amazing world cup season. You finished second woman in the world cup, so you’ve done a lot of these races before. Is it good to come back with more experience?
Jeruto Kisang:Yes, to come with more experience in 2024, but this year I became position two or three, but let me try my best.
iRunFar:Yes, I know I’ve seen that, that you have like come second or third so many times, which is really, really good results, but I suppose also frustrating when you’re competitive and you want to win. I think you won theGrossglockner Mountain Run?
Jeruto Kisang:No, I got a position three. No position one this year, but last year I tried to go the position one, and this year position two only and three.
iRunFar:But very consistently so it’s still very good.
Jeruto Kisang:Yes.
iRunFar:Of all the races you’ve done so far this year in the world cup, what do you think was your favorite? Your favorite race so far?
Jeruto Kisang:My favorite is running a mountain.
iRunFar:And last year you did the Golden Trail World Series as well.
Jeruto Kisang:Yes.
iRunFar:So that’s a lot of racing. And this year you decided to just do the world cup.
Jeruto Kisang:Yes.
iRunFar:And has that made things easier?
Jeruto Kisang:Yes, it is easier, but this year a lot of runners from all over Kenya, all over Europe, so I tried my best.
iRunFar:It’s just getting more and more competitive.
Jeruto Kisang:Yes, competitive. Very, very competitive.
iRunFar:And do you have your strategy worked out for both of these races in terms of pacing?
Jeruto Kisang:No.
iRunFar:No strategy? Just run?
Jeruto Kisang:Just run.
iRunFar:Ok, that sounds good. Keep it simple.
Jeruto Kisang:Oh, thanks.
iRunFar:And then after this, is this the end of your season or do you have more races at home in Kenya? Do you have more races at home after this?
Jeruto Kisang:I have theMount Longonot Trail Challengenext month. And a race in Iten, up and down. I have three in Kenya.
iRunFar:Well, the very best of luck this weekend, and we look forward to seeing you out there. Thank you so much.

iRunFar:Sarah Bradyof iRunFar. I’m here in Chiavenna, Italy, before the finals of the 2024Mountain Running World CupwithScout Adkin. How are you?
Scout Adkin:Good, thank you. Yes, thanks for having me on.
iRunFar:It’s great to meet you at last. This is our first time interviewing you, so we’d love a bit of your running background. We found international mountain running results for you back as far as 2019. What were you doing before that? Were you fell running?
Adkin:Yes, I was. Not quite at the international level. I’ve basically been fell running since I was a kid, actually. Done various things on track and cross country, and then came into fell running in the mountains. And then luckily I managed to get my first GB vest as a junior, and then had about 10 or 11 years of still running, but just not at the right level for various reasons. Then I started picking up four or five years ago. And yeah, been running on the circuit for a few years now.
iRunFar:Ok, super. And then as well, I think I’ve seen that you won a cross-country title in Scotland last year. Are you still doing that as well?
Adkin:Yes, yes,Scottish National Cross Country Championships. Yes, that was nice. I took a bit of a break from cross country for a few years, but I’ve been back doing it for a couple again now. It gives you a bit of a focus over winter as well, but for me, it’s very flat, very fast sort of running. Then the aim is to transition that into the mountains in the springtime.
iRunFar:Ok, brilliant. You’re from Scotland, but I think you live in the Lake District of England?
Adkin:Yes, that’s right. Yes, I grew up in Scotland, and then I’ve been living in the Lake District for a few years now for work. Yes, great place still to live in. Plenty of hills and fells to run on there as well.
iRunFar:I think it’s probably hard to live there and not be a fell runner.
Adkin:Yes. [laughs]
iRunFar:[laughs] Ok, very good. Just this season, you’ve had a really, really good world cup. You’ve had two wins: you were second in Sierre-Zinal, and second just last weekend as well atŠmarna Gora.
Adkin:Yeah.
iRunFar:For you, what was your highlight of the season?
Adkin:I think probably the highlight was the race in France, theMontée du Nid d’Aigle, mainly because it was, although it was net uphill, it was quite a long race for me. To prove that I’ve built on my strength and things, that I can actually race competitively at that distance, and then to back that up at Sierre-Zinal, which is a bit of a whirlwind of atmosphere. If you’ve been, you know what it’s like, very intense. It was a great experience to then go out and see how I could do at that. Thankfully, it went very well.
iRunFar:Yes, it sure did. You did amazing. Is that your longest distance to date?
Adkin:Yes. I hadn’t even trained at that distance for quite a few years. [laughs] It was great to just see and test yourself with also the heat and a bit of altitude as well. I hadn’t particularly trained for that race. I’ve been training for a variety of different races, from the short VKs like tomorrow, through to probably about 18 to 20 kilometers. It was more just to push the body and hope it held up really, to the end.
iRunFar:I guess the years of training and hard races, it all accumulates.
Adkin:Yeah. I think I’ve got such a very long history of running now that, yeah, I’ve got a good background, so that definitely helped.
iRunFar:Ok. It was a really good result. Such a strong field.
Adkin:Thank you.
iRunFar:Then as well as that, you competed at theEuropean Off-Road Championshipsin the uphill, and the up and down. I think you were fourth and second, was it?
Adkin:Yes. Second in the uphill and fourth in the up and down.
iRunFar:How was that?
Adkin:Yeah, it was interesting. Very typical Scottish weather, a lot of rain and quite a lot of mud, particularly on the uphill of course. No heat to worry about with that, so it was good. It’s just for everyone, it was very early in the season, being the end of May. Getting myself race-ready for that was quite a quick turnaround from cross-country season, but I’m really pleased with the results there.
iRunFar:And it must be just great to be part of such a strong team.
Adkin:Yeah, definitely. I’ve been lucky in the last few years to be part of both the uphill and the up-and-down teams for both the European and world championships It’s great being part of very strong women’s teams over the last few years.
iRunFar:As well as your teammates, your brotherJacob [Adkin]is competing in this world cup and he’s doing pretty good, too.
Adkin:Yes.
iRunFar:What’s it like to share the journey with him?
Adkin:It’s lovely having a bit of family company. Like me, he’s had his ups and downs in the last few years or so as well with various injuries and things like that. It was great this weekend catching up with him again, because we’re both doing different things in summer, so I haven’t seen him for a few months. It’s just nice to see him, and both getting silver in the uphill at the European Off Road Championships was a really nice family affair.
iRunFar:Yeah, I’m sure that was amazing.
Adkin:Yeah.
iRunFar:Do you get to train together at all?
Adkin:No, he lives in Scotland at the moment, or he’s traveling abroad, and obviously I’m in the Lake District at the moment. No, probably Christmas Day is the only day we probably generally would run together.
iRunFar:Nice tradition.
Adkin:Yeah, and then occasionally if we happen to be both visiting parents or whatever, we might run together then.
iRunFar:Ok, very good. I know you’ve been here before, you’ve raced the Chiavenna uphill?
Adkin:Yes, a couple of years ago. Yes, that’s right.
iRunFar:And then you did theNations Cuphere in 2021, which is kind of similar to the long trail race.
Adkin:Yes.
iRunFar:So, is there anything that you’ll take from those experiences that you think is good to know for this weekend?
Adkin:Yeah, so I think particularly for the uphill, although it’s obviously only just over three kilometers, it’s obviously very, very steep. So, although it’s not far in distance, it’s sort of pacing it as well, and with it being time trial, it always adds a nice interesting element to it as well. The up and down, although it’s a little bit slightly different to what I did three years ago, it’s nice sort of knowing some of the course, I think, as well. And again, it’s just a bit of pacing with that.
There’ll be a cheeky second climb in there as well, and there’s a lot of descent. So yeah, it’ll be fine. Just end of season now, last race of the series. So I’ll just give it my all, particularly by Sunday. And I can have a recovery and a rest after that.
iRunFar:Yeah, really good. I wanted to ask you as well, because a lot of these races are so compressed and you raced just a week ago, how have you found recovering and turning it around so quickly again?
Adkin:It is challenging. You can do it for a few weeks and then you do tend to need another couple of weeks of recovery. And particularly for myself, because I work as well, not quite full-time, four days a week. So, I’m traveling back and forth between races. So, although I was out in Slovenia last weekend, I’ve flown home, done a few days’ work, and then I was up at 2 a.m. yesterday to get my flight back out. So, yeah, it is quite challenging, and the recovery is tough, particularly with a lot of flying and traveling in between. But I tend to just not train as much, obviously, in between those sort of races. So, yeah.
iRunFar:You pulled it off anyway, you’ve made it to the end of the season, well done.
Adkin:Yeah, thank you.
iRunFar:I hope you have a fantastic weekend of racing.
Adkin:Thank you very much.
iRunFar:I look forward to seeing you out there.
Adkin:Great, thank you.

Women to Watch at the 2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals,https://www.irunfar.com/women-to-watch-at-the-2024-mountain-running-world-cup-finals,"The 2024Mountain Running World Cupfinishes its season this weekend in northern Italy, with theKilometro Verticale Lagùncand theVal Bregaglia Trail, and iRunFar is excited to cover these races!
This year’s12-race world cup, administered by the World Mountain Running Association, began with theBroken Arrow Skyraceevents in Northern California in June, traveled to iconic mountain running events likeGiir di Montin Italy,Sierre-Zinalin Switzerland, andŠmarna Gorain Slovenia, before moving to these final two events in Italy in October.
TheKilometro Verticale Lagùncstarts in the town of Chiavenna, at the bottom of a valley called Val Bregaglia, and finishes in the mountainside village of Lagùnc. Interestingly, this is the first vertical-kilometer (VK) course ever established, in 1986! It’s a perfect vertical kilometer of climbing over 3.3 lateral kilometers. This race takes place on Saturday, October 12, at 9:15 a.m. CEST and is run in traditional VK style as a time trial, with athletes starting every 15 seconds.
Thetrail race, the Val Bregaglia Trail, runs on Sunday, October 13 at 9:30 a.m. CEST. It covers some of the trails tracing their way around Val Bregaglia, which spans the Italy-Switzerland border. The event is 23 kilometers long, has 850 meters of climbing, and has 900 meters of descending on a point-to-point course starting in the village of Promontogno, Switzerland, and finishing in Chiavenna.
TheMountain Running World Cup is scoredvia an athlete’s best eight results over the course of the season, with points awarded to the top 18 finishers of each race. Prize money totals 30,000 Euro, and goes 10 deep in both the women’s and men’s series. A number of the individual races in the world cup offer their own prize money as well.

This weekend, fast female mountain runners will participate in one or both of these events, hoping to top the 2024 Mountain Running World Cup. In this preview, we look at the women expected to be top performers in one or both races. Theworld cup standingsare presently led by Kenya’sJoyce Muthoni Njeru, and she’s entered in both events this weekend, looking to improve her points total and seal her title. Behind her are a big group of chasers, including the U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-race interview) and Kenya’sPhilaries Jeruto Kisang(pre-race interview), who respectively sit in second and third place in the world cup thus far.
We’ll be providing coverage of both races this week, so stay tuned.
Thanks to the World Mountain Running Association for supporting iRunFar’s coverage of the 2024 Mountain Running World Cup Finals.
Be sure to check out ourin-depth men’s previewas well.
Here are the women we expect to compete for the top spots at one or both the Kilometro Verticale Lagùnc and Val Bregaglia Trail.
A presence for years on the global mountain running circuit, Kenya’sJoyce Muthoni Njeruis having a big 2024 while simultaneously competing in the Mountain Running World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series — and she’s shining in both. She was also the 2023 Mountain Running World Cup champion. Her lead in the 2024 standings is courtesy of a sweep of the two world cup events, a VK and aSkyrace, at Broken Arrow as well as wins at Italy’s Trofeo Nasego and Slovenia’s Šmarna Gora. She’s registered to compete in both the VK and trail race this weekend. The races and series are hers to lose.

The U.K.’sScout Adkin(pre-race interview) has been performing on the international level in mountain running since at least the 2022 World Mountain Running Championships, when she tookfifth at the Up and Down race. In 2023, she was in the top 10 at the world championships again, takingeighth at the Uphill race.Her top performance in 2024 so far has been a big one, taking second at Sierre-Zinal, which will be this year’s most competitive mountain race by leaps and bounds.
She was also fourth at the European Off Road Championships Up and Down race this year. The world cup rankings are quite close for 1st through 3rd places Joyce Muthoni Njeru, Adkin, and Philaries Jeruto Kisang, and with Adkin also registered in both events, there’s plenty of room for a shakeup in the women’s podium.

Philaries Jeruto Kisang(pre-race interview), of Kenya, rocketed onto our radar last summer at the 2023 World Mountain Running Championships when she tooksecond at the Uphill race, and seventh at theUp and Down race. Like her countrywoman Joyce Muthoni Njeru, she’s also having a big mountain running summer while competing in the Mountain Running World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series.
She took second in the 2023 Mountain Running World Cup, behind Muthoni Njeru. She’s registered for both Saturday’s VK and Sunday’s trail race, and the points difference between her and the rest of the women’s top three in the world cup are close enough that it’ll come down to these two races.

Susanna Saapunki, from Finland but living in Italy, has several years of excellence in mountain running under her belt, with perhaps her top performance of the last couple being asixth at the 2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race. Earlier this year, she was sixth at the 2024 European Off Road Championships Up and Down race.
In this year’s world cup, her performances have gotten stronger as the season has progressed, and she podiumed at both events in Nasego, Italy, at the start of September. Also, just a week after Nasego, Saapunki took the win at the Jungfrau Marathon, showing that her later-season form might be peaking at just the right time for this weekend. She’s signed up for both the VK and trail race.

The U.S.’sLauren Gregoryis registered for the VK, and is a pretty good bet for a top-five position in this race. Her top mountain running result thus far was in taking 12th at the 2022 World Mountain Running Championships Uphill race. She’s also a two-time U.S. Mountain Running Champion, having won both the 2022 and the 2024 U.S. Mountain Running Championships Uphill race.

All signs point to the U.K.’sSarah Willhoitbeing a runner on the rise in the global mountain running scene, with her participating in both the 2023 and 2024 Mountain Running World Cups. Last year, she took ninth in the overall standings. Her top performance in the world cup this year was third place at Giir di Mont, but she also competed at both races in Nasego, taking eighth and 10th at the VK and trail race, respectively. She’s registered for both races this weekend.

Mammoth Trail Fest 26k Results: Joyce Muthoni Njeru and Elhousine Elazzaoui Dominate,https://www.irunfar.com/mammoth-trail-fest-26k-results-joyce-muthoni-njeru-and-elhousine-elazzaoui-dominate,"The eighth race of the 2024 Golden Trail World Series, and the last before the final, theMammoth Trail Fest 26kkicked off in Mammoth Lakes, California, at 10 a.m. on Sunday, August 22. The 16.1-mile course, starting and ending in Mammoth Village, has more than 3,900 feet of climbing and tops out at 11,053 feet, making it a proper high-altitude race.
Racers were greeted with cool, clear, and sunny conditions on race morning. The women started 20 minutes ahead of the men, providing them with their own race. Golden Trail World Series leaderJoyce Muthoni Njeruof Kenya took the early lead and never gave it up, finishing nearly three minutes ahead of Romania’sMădălina Florea. In the men’s race, the top four in the series standings ran together earlier on beforeElhousine Elazzaouiof Morocco andPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya pulled away over the summit of Mammoth Mountain and ran together for the rest of the race to a sprint finish, where Elazzaoui came away with the win.
The event is the queen event of the three-day Mammoth Trail Fest event. With a $21,000 prize purse up for grabs and prize money going 10 deep — as well as points leading into the Golden Trail World Series final up for grabs — the field was filled with some of the best shorter-distance trail racers vying for the top spot on the podium.
After leaving the village, the single-loop course climbs steeply to the top of Mammoth Mountain in the first 7.5 miles, gaining nearly all of its elevation in the span of three miles along the Dragon’s Back. From the summit, it drops steeply to the McCoy aid station, tackling the new Bullet downhill, before starting a more gradual descent on mountain bike trails back into the village for a final romp through the streets to the finish line.
Joyce Muthoni Njeruof Kenya, the current leader of the Golden Trail World Series, didn’t waste any time, taking off from the start to establish an early lead in the women’s race. By the first aid station at Twin Lakes, 3.6 miles and 25:21 in, but before any of the steep climbing, she’d already opened up an 18-second gap on second-placeMădălina Floreaof Romania and a 39-second gap on third-placeLauren Gregory.

Muthoni Njeru reached the summit of Mammoth Mountain, 7.5 miles into the race, at 1:14:29, leading Florea by more than two minutes. But coming over the top, Florea opened up her stride, not ready to surrender the race.
Behind them, on the steep, rocky, and switchbacking climb up to the summit of Mammoth Mountain,Rachel Drakeput in a huge effort to move into third over the summit, two and a half minutes behind Florea and with a 17-second lead onAnna Gibsonin fourth place. Gregory was just another 30 seconds back in fifth, the spots for the podium still up for grabs on the long downhill.
Florea held a fast pace on the initial miles of the downhill, looking to be running much more aggressively than Muthoni Njeru on the wider open sections on the ski resort, but was unable to close the gap. Coming into the McCoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles in 1:37:24, Muthoni Njeru held a 2:09 lead on Florea, while Drake and Gibson ran together another 4:38 back. Gregory was only a minute back from the duo, still within reach of third.
After McCoy, racers faced the Bullet downhill, a newly added section of steep and technical downhill on the course. The steeper sections didn’t slow anyone down, and as the race reached the flatter mountain bike trails, Muthoni Njeru continued to hold a strong pace in the lead, reaching the Garage checkpoint at mile 14.8 in 1:56:45. Florea was 1:56 behind with a significant six-minute gap over third-place Drake and fourth-place Gibson, who continued to run together.
Joyce Muthoni Njeru cruised into the finish without any pressure with a time of 2:11:56, taking her third win in the series and further padding her overall series lead, and Mădălina Florea finished second in 2:14:51, after taking a fall and cutting her knee. Anna Gibson used her background in the track to pull away from Drake on the gradual downhill to take third.
(In 2023, Ostrander was suspended for four months after testing positive for canrenone, a metabolite of spironolactone, after it was determined that she mistakenly took the drug without first obtaining a World Anti-Doping Agency Therapeutic Use Exemption.)
Full results.
It didn’t take long for the top four men in the Golden Trail World Series standings to separate themselves from the rest of the field.Philemon Ombogo Kiriagoof Kenya andRémi Bonnetof Switzerland pushed the pace on the relatively flat early miles, withElhousine Elazzaouiof Morocco andPatrick Kipngenoof Kenya chasing. The group came through the first aid station at Twin Lakes around 22 minutes into the race within 10 seconds of each other, and 15 seconds clear of the rest of the field.
Last year’s winner and course-record holder, Bonnet, was just 48 hours clear of winning the vertical kilometer (VK) race and had stated in a pre-race interview that he planned to stay with the leaders early on before launching an attack on the climb, hoping to create a gap big enough to hold off the rest of the field before the downhill. But when the climbing started, Elazzaoui, Kipngeno, and Ombogo Kiriago pushed the pace and opened up a gap on the defending champion.
Kipngeno was the first to the summit in 1:01:50, just three seconds up on Elazzaoui, who is known for his descending prowess. The duo had opened up a significant 1:40 gap over Bonnet, who looked to be struggling, potentially dealing with fatigue from his VK effort two days prior, and Ombogo Kiriago, who also dropped off the pace, another 40 seconds back.
In the early miles of the downhill, Elazzaoui let Kipngeno set the pace on the twisting singletrack, and the two came into the McCoy checkpoint at 11.1 miles together in 1:21:38. Elazzaoui continued to stay behind Kipngeno, letting small gaps open before cutting the apex of the corners, taking slightly shorter routes to repeatedly close the gap. When the two came to the new, and steep, Bullet Downhill section, Elazzaoui, who had been clearly biding his time, made his move and quickly opened a significant gap with only a few miles to go.
At the Garage checkpoint, Elazzaoui, who is not known for liking to lead alone, was back with Kipngeno with 2.3 miles to go, setting the pair up for a sprint finish. Behind them, Bonnet was three minutes back.
In the final streets, Elazzaoui opened up the sprint first, and when Kipngeno tried to get by on the inside of a corner, he found himself blocked by the Moroccan and had to hit the brakes. Elazzaoui took the win in 1:49:35 and also took the overall lead for the Golden Trail World Series going into the final. Ombogo Kiriago came in third ahead of last year’s winner Bonnet.

2024 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile Results: Mann Sets Course Record and Lockwood Secures Second Victory,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-run-rabbit-run-100-mile-results,"TheRun Rabbit Run 100 Milehas been a quintessential American fall 100 miler for years, both for its mountain fall scenery and competitive dynamics, and the 2024 edition was no different. In the men’s race,Richard Lockwoodran away with his second win, backing up his 2022 victory with an even faster and more dominant performance. In the women’s race, CanadianEmilie Mannset a new course record by running 19:48:05, in doing so bestingMichele Yates’smark of 20:16:54, which had stood since 2013, by more than 27 minutes.
For 2024, the event experienced good weather, with warm daytime conditions leading to a cool to cold night, all normal for a mid-September weekend in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.
The Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile course is about 101.5 miles long, with 20,300 feet of climbing, and takes place at altitudes ranging from about 6,600 to 10,600 feet.
Uniquely, this event hosts two starts, one for the speedier “hares” and another for the steady “tortoises.” The hares’ race began on Friday, September 13, at 1 p.m. local time and had a 30-hour cutoff.
Also uniquely, this event hosts a huge prize purse — over $100,000 in total — with $15,000 going to the men’s and women’s winners, prize money seven deep in both races, and a host of other dollars doled out for preems, a team event, masters and senior runners, and more.

In the early race miles, eventual men’s champ and 2022 victorRichard Lockwoodseemed content to run as either the leader or a close chaser. To those of us watching from the outside, he seemed to be patiently passing the miles until the other men around him dropped back one by one. The last man fell behind somewhere before mile 71, and from there, Lockwood exerted utter dominance over the men’s field. His lead grew slowly at first, and rapidly in the race’s final miles, until he crossed the line in 17:24:41. This was about 47 minutes clear of the second man and 35 minutes faster thanhis 2022 victory.

Men’s second-place finisherAdam Loomisavenged a drop at this event last year with a solid start-to-finish performance that saw him pushing the men’s leaders in the race’s first half before clearly demarcating the second-place position in the race’s final third. His 18:12:17 was well clear of third place.
With three prior finishes at this event, including fifth and sixth places,Christopher Hammesknows how to run this race. Letting some of the racing games happen around him while running in the middle of the men’s top 10 for most of the race, he moved into his ultimate third-place position after mile 82 to finish in 18:56:34, close to an hour faster than his best prior finish. This follows a win at the 2024 High Lonesome 100 Mile less than two months ago.
Tyler GreenandNicholas Lightbodyrounded out the men’s top five. With this finish, Green caps off a summer 100-mile double that saw him take seventh at the 2024 Western States 100 before finishing fourth at this race, and Lightbody continuing to develop his trail-ultra career, following up on sixth at the Black Canyon 60k and second at the Canyons by UTMB 100 Mile in 2024.
Full results.
In winning the women’s race,Emilie Mannof Canada made event history, setting a new course record and besting a record time that had stood for 11 years. Her approach was to chill among the lead women early, run a steady middle race, and totally slay the final miles. At the top of the first climb, Mann arrived among a passel of fast women, running a minute and change behind earliest leader and course record holderMichele Yates. As late as mile 89, Mann was still running in second place behind then-leaderLeah Yinglingbefore assuming the lead, running away with things, and finishing in 19:48:05, a win of over 30 minutes.
Second-place Yingling put up a heckuva fight, running among the top women early, assuming the women’s lead for some of the race’s middle to late miles, and ultimately taking second in 20:19:24, just 2.5 minutes shy of the prior course record. This possibly closes a big year of racing for Yingling, which has included participating in the lululemon FURTHER six-day event in the spring and taking 10th at the 2024 Western States 100 in the summer.
Shea Aquilanocrossed the line to finish in third place in the women’s race, but was marked later as a DNF. Her social media explains that she went off course for about two miles, but didn’t know until after the finish.
Barrett Graywas, thus, retroactively moved up into third position, in what looks to be her 100-mile debut.
Nicole Laughtontook fourth, whileStacey Marionwas the fifth woman. For Laughton, this performance follows up on past wins at events like the Rocky Raccoon 100 Mile and Arkansas Traveler 100 Mile in recent years. And Marion caps off a big summer here following a finish at the Broken Arrow Skyrace 46k and a win at the Tushars Mountain Runs 100k.

WithKatie Schidesetting a new women’s course recordand the men’s podium turning out to be a major surprise, includinga win byVincent Bouillard(France), there were plenty of big storylines to follow at the 2024UTMB. Still, more than 2,500 runners took to the big loop around Mont Blanc, and there are countless stories and experiences — ranging far beyond those of the elites — of people taking on the challenge of the 109-mile route.

Lopez:Thank you very much. It’s really a dream come true. And I know I’m still at loss for words of what this means. For all South America, I think it’s super big. And yeah, I’m just kind of speechless. It’s going to settle down sometime, hopefully.
iRunFar:I think that’s the most important thing to start with, is that you are the first Latin American podium finisher of UTMB. That is huge for your continent.
Lopez:Yeah. There’s a lot of levels in South America, it’s just that it’s difficult for us living far, don’t have the same support sometimes.
iRunFar:Right.
Lopez:I don’t know. I think that this will mark a new era, a new step forward, because maybe we have a little bit more of attention and there’s more opportunities for us. And that’s some of the reasons, I don’t know when I’m suffering in the race and I’m like… Everyone has this, why run? For me, just trying to make this sport more inclusive is one of them. So yeah, I was fighting so hard all of the race, just thinking about what was going to happen. It makes me happy.
iRunFar:I think that’s probably a really important thing to point out, that Latin American not finishing on the podium until now. It’s not about the talent, it’s about the access to the races and the resources, and then making it all the way over here in Europe, right.
Lopez:Exactly. Not just South America, we can talk about that in Africa or in China. This community, this sport is amazing and I’m pretty sure in the next few years we’re going to see a lot more inclusivity and podiums that are way more diverse than now. And it makes me excited of what’s coming.
iRunFar:Yeah, what is coming is pretty fantastic. This is iRunFar’s first interview with you. I’d love to learn a little bit about you. You are from Ecuador, but now you live in Spain and you’re a coach.
Lopez:Yeah. So I’m 32-years-old.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:I grew up in Ecuador, in Quito at 2,800 meters.
iRunFar:High altitude.
Lopez:High altitude, yeah. With big mountains in the Andes. And I went to Barcelona to do a Master’s Degree in Exercise Science.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:And I stayed a little bit longer because I figured out that living at sea level was a little bit better for training and just being close to the races. Talking more about that inclusivity part, just paying a flight in Europe to get to all these big races or just that train, it’s easier than coming from Ecuador and having to pay so much for crossing the Atlantic.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Lopez:And I just wanted to give myself some years to develop as an athlete and being in the races that are most important in the world. And that’s a little bit of my background. And I’m the founder of Ecuadoruns, which is a trail running sports training company in Ecuador. So the community is growing in Ecuador. It’s right now actuallyQuito Trail by UTMBwas the first big raise in Ecuador, and it has 3,000 people in there.
iRunFar:Amazing.
Lopez:Super inspiring as well.
iRunFar:You have been running trail and ultras for a little over a decade I believe, according to your results. Did you play sports as a kid? How did you find long-distance trail running?
Lopez:So I grew up doing adventure racing.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:Yeah. I don’t know if many people know about adventure racing, it’s a super small sport, more than running, also has orienteering and bikes and kayak.
iRunFar:Climbing.
Lopez:Exactly. So I started that because my brother is a race organizer and he started doing adventure races in Ecuador and I was the first one following in his steps. So I grew up running in the mountains, discovering. And more than running, maybe just exploring the mountains and doing hikes and big days outside. And when the first race of trail running came to Ecuador I was 18, I think.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:And I signed up and I won. And I was like, okay, I think… And then-
iRunFar:Was that your first race or first running race?
Lopez:Running race, exactly.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:I’ve done adventure races, but I’ve never done a running race.
iRunFar:Running full, yeah.
Lopez:It was the first trail running event in Ecuador.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:It was back in the time that there was this, the The North Face Endurance.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Lopez:Do you remember those?
iRunFar:Yeah.
Lopez:It was one of those.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:That came to Ecuador.
iRunFar:Ah, okay.
Lopez:I don’t remember the year, but it was like… I don’t know.
iRunFar:2014, in that era.
Lopez:Exactly.
iRunFar:Yep.
Lopez:I even remember thatTimothy Olsonwas there, he was invited to the race. And also… I don’t remember. Well it was a long time ago.
iRunFar:A few North American-
Lopez:Michael Wardian.
iRunFar:Race athletes. Ah, okay.
Lopez:Michael Wardian was there.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:Yeah, in that era.
iRunFar:Cool.
Lopez:Yeah. And I won that 50k, not the 80, the long event with all those stars.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Lopez:I always enjoyed the adventure, but I was not such a fan of biking, just mountain bike and kayaking. So I was like, okay, I want to try to develop more as a runner. From there on I started doing trail running races.
iRunFar:And now when you look at your race results, it seems like there’s really a diverse set of things that you’re doing. You don’t do all 100-mile races or long ones, though you’ve done plenty of them. And you race a lot both in Europe and also in South America. So you live now in Spain, in Barcelona, you must be going back and forth with your company and with family time, and also to race still in South America.
Lopez:Exactly. So first, I just love this sport in all the distances. My strength is over 100 kilometers.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:But I love to go to shorter events and just get super vulnerable, not being even in the top 50, maybe. Go sometimes to a Skyrunning race that is something super different.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Lopez:I did one this year and I was super scared just doing a line, super cautious. So I don’t know, it’s just fun to do, experience the sport in everything. Of course, I have goals that are ultra distance races as UTMB, but I have a lot of enjoyment in just trying a lot of stuff.
iRunFar:Lots of stuff.
Lopez:Because of work I have to go back at least one or two times to Ecuador. So for me, it’s super important to share with the community in Ecuador, more if I’m not living there. So every time I go I try to be in some races, to share with people. And it inspires a lot of people, just to see what is happening in Europe, what I’m doing, and for them to start dreaming big.
So it’s good for the development in the sport in South America. So I try to do that every year. Maybe not just in Ecuador but also in other countries of the region, because I know it will help develop just the community.
iRunFar:I love that. So moving our conversation to this race, this is not the first time you’ve raced UTMB. Was this your third finish?
Lopez:Yeah.
iRunFar:Okay. And your results started in 2019, so five years ago, and I think your time over your three finishes has improved by more than two and a half hours.
Lopez:Yeah.
iRunFar:That’s huge.
Lopez:So my first time here was in 2019. I did 22 hours 47 minutes.
iRunFar:I love that you know to the minute. Good for you.
Lopez:I try to be super planning.
iRunFar:It’s like a really good runner. Totally on it with the splits and the numbers and the details.
Lopez:Yeah. I came here just to finish the race, my goal was… It’s my first 100 miler.
iRunFar:But you were in the top 10 still?
Lopez:Yeah.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:It was my first 100 miler.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:And I was just like, I just want to finish this race. It’s my first time doing this. And I finished sixth with any expectations of doing that. So when I finished… But I finished super destroyed. It was so painful, because I wasn’t prepared for that. As soon as I was climbing to the top 10, I was already super beaten up, but I was like, I’m not going to let this go. So it was such a suffering, it was super hurt. I finished destroyed. So destroyed that I didn’t come back.
iRunFar:Like I need a couple of years to…
Lopez:Yeah, exactly. But then in 2000… Last year. No, I didTDSas well. I did TDS and I finished second in 2022.
iRunFar:TDS was ’22.
Lopez:And that gave me the confidence. I was like, okay, I now think I’m prepared for doing UTMB well. So I came back last year and I did exactly one hour less, 21 hours 47 minutes. I lowered one hour-
iRunFar:To the minute.
Lopez:To the minute, exactly. But the cool thing is that when I finished the first time I was like, I will never do less than this time. But last year when I finished, I had the feeling right away that I was able to do it better. I was like, I know I can do a better performance. It doesn’t matter the time. I know I can be better in this race.
So I started training super specific. From that moment till now I’m training now withDarcie Murphy.
iRunFar:Oh, cool.
Lopez:Who you might know?
iRunFar:Yeah.
Lopez:So we were like, okay, that’s the plan. We’re going to get you to the best position here to this race. And it worked. I’ve never felt so well physically, I’m pretty sure last, the other two times, it was more a mind kind of… I don’t know, power more than a physical power.
iRunFar:Yeah. You overpowered the physical fatigue-
Lopez:Yeah, exactly.
iRunFar:To keep going and have a good performance.
Lopez:Yeah. So now it was both things combined.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:My mind was the same energy and the same motivation and the same kind of push, but my body was with it as well. So yeah, it was the first time that I really felt like, okay, I can be fighting for positions. I deserve to be here to fight for whatever it took me. I didn’t expect to finish third, I have to say. My goal, my A goal was to do 21 hours. That will be amazing.
iRunFar:Well you did that.
Lopez:What happened is that I decided not to look. I didn’t look at the… I think I looked twice to see what time is it. But I just went all the time with just feeling, I didn’t see anything. I was just running in the moment.
iRunFar:Okay. So to talk a little bit about how the race unfolded, I think you started out kind of casually. You were outside the top 10, outside the top 25 even, for maybe the first 50k. Does that sound-
Lopez:Yeah.
iRunFar:About right? And then you started to very methodically move up.
Lopez:Yeah. So I know that UTMB, it’s crazy. The start gets people with adrenaline and it’s where you can do a lot of mistakes. And I think I try to be super conscious about how I’m feeling, regardless of what’s happening around. And there’s proof about that,Ludovic [Pommeret], he’s always doing the same. There’s proof that you can do a good race, not suffering so much at the beginning.
iRunFar:Right.
Lopez:So I can’t say that I was feeling comfortable, because still if you want to fight to be out there, you have to push. But at least I was not thinking about the rest. I didn’t even know what position I was. I was just knowing that I was eating well, that I was running to my rhythm and not worrying about anything else, and just moving forward. And, of course, I have my team that looks at me in every station, and they know if they have to tell me something. And they were just believing in you, you’re doing great, just believing in you.
And when I went to Courmayeur, it was tough. So as soon as I entered, it was like, okay, things get real from here on. You’re tough, and there’s two people here that doesn’t look so well. So top 10 is in reach. And from there on, I started super motivated to get as high as possible, but I didn’t expect to pass so many people.
iRunFar:Yeah. And I think your movement from inside the top 10 to now in podium position happened pretty quickly between Courmayeur and I think maybe you took on podium position between La Fouly and Champex-Lac.
Lopez:Yeah. So at night, I think my background from adventure racing helped me a lot in the night. I felt just… I don’t know, I felt super secure.
iRunFar:Right.
Lopez:And I’ve been many times running without sleep, so I know how my body feels in that situation. I know what to eat, what to do. Even at night it was hot. So I was wetting myself all the time in the river, stopping, just taking care of myself.
iRunFar:So smart.
Lopez:And I saw people, in Arnouvaz I passedTom EvansandHannes [Namberger]. I was able to see that they were not taking that much care, they were not stopping that much. And I saw and I felt stronger than them. And in there they told me that I was in top five. And I saw two lights. So I was like, wow-
iRunFar:That’s the podium up there.
Lopez:There going to be a real fight.
iRunFar:Wow.
Lopez:So in La Fouly I think I reached third.
iRunFar:And I think it’s still over 50 kilometers to go, 50 or 60 kilometers to go. So when you became in the podium position, did you grow protective and scared? And were you looking behind you or were you looking forward?
Lopez:So as soon as I went out of La Fouly there’s a descent and then you start a climb up to Champex-Lac. And I was alone and I was like, okay. They told me thatGermain [Grangier]andVincent [Bouillard]were far away. So I was like, okay, I need to be calm and just… I don’t know, I’m alone so I can do my things, don’t worry about anything.
And as soon as I started the climb, I saw four people back, four together.
iRunFar:They’re coming.
Lopez:I was like, oh no, this is going to be hard. In the aid station in Champex-Lac, as I was just about to head out, all of them came in together. So it was hard. And then the good thing is thatBaptiste [Chassagne], he caught me going up to La Giete, I think it is.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:And we motivated each other a lot.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:He caught me and I was able to go in his pace and we kind of worked together. I don’t know, we were like, okay, let’s go. Even thinking more about going to the second place.
iRunFar:Right.
Lopez:And when we were getting to that Refuge, we saw Germain. But in the place that we saw Germain, we saw back and we saw Ludovic and we saw Hannes. So it was like, ah, this is going to be hard.
iRunFar:The race is not over.
Lopez:Yeah.
iRunFar:It’s only starting.
Lopez:But I have to say that in that moment I was confirmed with top five. I was like, I have to get into top five. That’s my dream. That will be more than amazing. And Baptiste is looking better than me. Germain is, I don’t think I can pass Germain. And Vincent, they told us, don’t even think about him because he’s far away.
iRunFar:Uh-huh.
Lopez:But then reaching to Trient we passed Germain. And they were like, oh no…
iRunFar:I have to think about podium.
Lopez:Now I have to think about third. So yeah, it was intense. All the race we were looking back, and we didn’t see Hannes, but we kept getting splits that he was looking better than us.
iRunFar:Not far.
Lopez:And he was not that far. But I think the best for both of us, for Baptiste and myself was that we were fighting together. So that kept us moving on.
iRunFar:Yeah. And how long did that go on with you and Baptiste?
Lopez:All the way.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:So he kind of made a move out of Vallorcine, and I was like, okay, my strategy is just to go as fast as I can and maybe I get him better, but at least that is going to keep me out of getting passed by Hannes. And I was surprised that when I started the climb, they told me it’s about four minutes. And when I was almost getting to the Refuge-
iRunFar:Of the final climb?
Lopez:Yeah.
iRunFar:So La Flégère.
Lopez:La Flégère.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:I saw him super close. It was like one minute. So it was like, okay, this is not over until the end. And I think we head out of La Flégère by two minutes and a half or something like that, like three minutes. And in the last descent, I actually was keeping time with him, but I almost fell and I was like…
iRunFar:You were pushing a little too much.
Lopez:Yeah. And I started getting a little bit of dizziness.
iRunFar:Okay.
Lopez:So yeah, I was like, okay, no, no. It is not the place to risk so much, I’m in the podium. This is already more than amazing for me. I am just going to try to take care and reach the finish line. So yeah, that was when I started hitting the brakes a little bit.
iRunFar:At the finish line, it was very emotional to watch, there were so many people, clearly South Americans, friends of South Americans. You had a continent excited for you at the finish line. Explain a little bit about what that felt like and what that was like for you.
Lopez:It’s amazing. Even I think that for us, we’re in that maybe top 10, there’s more people. But it’s amazing seeing right now, all the community there clapping for everyone that is getting to the finish line. Everyone has made such an effort to get around this big mountain. And getting here it’s so meaningful. And for me it was, I don’t know, I felt a lot of gratitude for this community, for real, just everyone being there and these vibes that are so amazing.
And yeah, seeing so many flags of South America and people talking Spanish, for me meant even more. I cried so much and even after the finish line, I still… In the doping control I was still… Every time I thought about what had just happened, I cried again.
iRunFar:I’m in doping control, but I’m so happy.
Lopez:So I don’t know, I’m kind of processing it, but it’s just so amazing. I haven’t even looked so much at my phone. But it’s such a small country, Ecuador is super small. And having this… And for me, representing such a small country. And dreaming big, it just a nice message to get out there. If you can dream for something and you can fight for it, it’s worth it.
iRunFar:That’s a fantastic way to end this interview. Joaquin Lopez, congratulations on your podium finish at the 2024 UTMB. Keep dreaming big. I can’t wait to see what you do next.
Lopez:Thank you very much.

iRunFar:Sarah Brady of iRunFar. I’m here the day after the 2024 UTMB with third place woman, Marianne Hogan. Congratulations. Marianne. How are you feeling?
Hogan:Thank you. I’m good. I’m not that bad actually.
iRunFar:Okay, brilliant. Yeah, still upright. That’s an achievement.
Hogan:Yeah, exactly.
iRunFar:What an amazing day for you. So I know you were a second here last year, but you’ve knocked an hour and 20 minutes off your time, was it?
Hogan:Yeah, but I had a full psoas this time around, so I think it was a little easier for me to drop some time off.
iRunFar:Yeah, amazing achievement. I just remember you saying in your pre-race interview that your ambition for this was to be able to race right to the finish. Do you feel like you were able to do that this time around?
Hogan:I feel like there’s still some better things I could do. I had a little bit of an issue with my legs at the end, and it really showed off in that last portion of the course, but I feel like I raced more than I did in 2022, so I have to be somewhat satisfied, even if I’m still a little hungry to come back for more.
iRunFar:Yeah, so not a perfect day, but an improvement.
Hogan:Yeah.
iRunFar:So you started off pretty aggressively, so from about 30k in, I think you were already in second, but everyone was bunched together quite close. How did you find that opening part of the race?
Hogan:Yeah, I think it’s a good warm up for the course in a certain way. I feel it’s an easier portion of the race and you always kind of feel good in that portion. Or the two times that I’ve done it, I just feel like it’s a portion that has a lot of flow to it, and I was just having a good time and just trying to not go out too fast but go out fast enough that I’m having a good time, I guess.
iRunFar:Okay, cool. And then a little bit later on, by the time you got to Courmayeur,Katie [Schide]had gone off in front and then you’re still in second, and Blandine [L’Hirondel] is maybe seven or eight minutes behind, so you kind of had some breathing room then. Did that feel good to just be on your own for a while?
Hogan:Yeah, I feel like I’m not really a person that races with regards to my competitors in a certain way. I just kind of go with how I’m feeling, and it didn’t really matter to me how far Katie was ahead or Blandine was behind. That’s just the pace that I was going. So it was good information to have. I knew that Katie had gone on fast because a lot of people had been telling me along the course. But yeah, it was good to know where Blandine was because I had ran a little bit with her, so it was just interesting to see where I was and how I was feeling in comparison to them, I guess.
iRunFar:And you seem to have a really strong third quarter to the race and you moved ahead a little bit more, but then there was a bit of an incident here. What happens with your hand?
Hogan:Yeah, I was feeling pretty good all the way to Arnuva, and on the way down I was starting to have my legs act up again, kind of the same general issues that I always have. It was starting to get to me and I don’t know, out of the blue, I got distracted and I hit a rock and I went flying forward and my finger went in the wrong direction.
iRunFar:Oh gosh.
Hogan:I didn’t know if it was broken, if it was dislocated, but clearly it was completely out of whack, so I knew something was up with it.
iRunFar:And did you stop for long? Not that there’s much you can do about that on the side of a mountain, but did you stop for long to try and address it or did you just power through?
Hogan:No. The live was with me, so I just said, “Oh, I think I just broke my finger,” and I got back up and started running again. Of course, it was somewhat painful, but I guess when you’re in the middle of an ultra, you’re already in pain, so it doesn’t really matter at that point.
iRunFar:Yeah, it’s probably less noticeable than if that happened in daily life.
Hogan:Yeah, exactly.
iRunFar:And you were saying just before it became a little tricky then using your poles, how did you manage with that for the rest of the race?
Hogan:Yeah, it became quite tricky actually. Just putting weight on my poles, that whole hand was a little hard and every time that my pole would hit the ground, it was giving a shock to my finger. So I had to just roll with it because there’s not really else anything else I could have done. At Champex, I was briefly examined by the medical team there and they wanted to do this, tape my two fingers together, but I opted not to do that because I felt like it was going to restrict me even more and just decided that we were going to deal with whatever was going on at the finish line.
iRunFar:That’s very brave. And then when I saw you at Vallorcine, you looked like you were just tired like someone who’d been out for a lot of hours and through the night, which you were, but you were still moving well on the downhill. Your legs obviously held up pretty good.
Hogan:Yeah, it was interesting. When I hit my hand, it’s as if the pain switched to my finger instead of my legs. But I think by Vallorcine it was, I don’t know, five or six hours later and the pain had come back into my legs. And if I’m being honest, I struggled quite a bit on that descent through Vallorcine and, from that point on, I was kind of losing control to the function of my legs. And I knew that the next section was going to be difficult and I had to give it my all and give it a shot to try to hold on to second. But I knew thatRuth [Croft]was closing in hard on me, and I respect Ruth incredibly a lot. And I knew that she was going to be a hard closer and I gave it my best shot, but she came flying by.
iRunFar:Was it a relief in a way to stop looking over your shoulder?
Hogan:No, because I didn’t really want to look back, but at some point I knew she was coming because the live stream, the person following me, left me, went behind and then came back and, at which point, I said, “You went to see Ruth?” And she said, “Yeah.” “If you’re coming back,” I was like, “she’s probably close.” So yeah, he said, “Yeah, she’s coming,” and she just flew by and that was it.
iRunFar:Okay, fair. And did you switch focus then? Did you think about trying to chase her or did you just switch focus to just holding onto your podium spot?
Hogan:I think neither. I actually was moving as quickly as I could. I really couldn’t … Lifting my legs, my hamstring was just incredibly tight and I couldn’t do much more than what I was doing. So I was just thinking, “We’re moving forward, we’re moving forward, and how ever fast I can get there is as fast as I’ll get there, but I just got to make it to the finish line and see what happens.” Because I was giving it my best effort. That’s for sure.
iRunFar:Yeah, amazing. So much grit. Yeah, just such a competitive women’s race this year. And then, are you going to take some sort of downtime now? I know you’re staying here in Chamonix until Wednesday, so what are your plans for after the race to recover?
Hogan:I’m going to relax with my family. My family’s here and it’s really nice to be able to spend some time with them after the race. So I’m excited for that. And then we’ll see. I think I’m going to take the time my body needs to recover and then start thinking about the next thing, I guess.
iRunFar:Okay, very good. So you’ve had two really strong UTMB experiences in a row, getting progressively better, but you still haven’t quite peaked at this race. So do you think you’ll have to come back again?
Hogan:Yeah, for sure. The thought was coming through my mind as I was losing the function of my legs in that last section. I just thought I want to come back and try to solve the puzzle of how I can make my legs work till the end. And yeah, I’m determined to come back and give it another shot. That’s for sure.
iRunFar:Okay, very good. We can’t wait to see what more you can do on this course.
Hogan:Thank you.
iRunFar:Congratulations and thanks very much.
Hogan:Thank you.

In the following interview, Ruth talks about running according to splits for the race’s first half to keep things conservative, moving up into podium position in the race’s second half, and her late-race pass ofMarianne Hoganto take second place.
For more on how the race played out, read our in-depth2024 UTMB resultsarticle.
﻿﻿﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m with Ruth Croft. It’s the day after the 2024 UTMB, and you are the women’s second place finisher. How does that sound?
Croft:Yeah, no, it was good. I had a plan going into the race and executed it pretty much how I wanted to.
iRunFar:So there was, I guess, maybe a bit of a rumor going around pre-race, that you were going to, I don’t know, take it easy in the first half and then really push in the second half. And looking at how your race played out, it seems like you did exactly what that rumor said you were going to do.
Croft:Yeah. I had a race plan and I had all the splits that I needed for each timing point through to, it was pretty much the whole race, but the goal was to stick with them to Courmayeur. And yeah, pretty much, it was either a minute or two minutes up or down at all the timing points. And the goal was to get to Courmayeur trying to feel like I hadn’t run 81k. And then I just didn’t want it to be like, go out hard and then death march it in. I was trying to really avoid that.
iRunFar:And you had developed these splits based on the premise of if you can keep yourself fairly fresh early, you’ll be able to go, perhaps go harder than you would’ve been.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:Than by going out more aggressively.
Croft:Exactly. I think for me, running a good hundred miles was going to come down to how well I paced it, and if I started too fast, yeah, I wasn’t going to be able to close fast. And so I was just going to be conservative and then try and pick people off in the back half.
iRunFar:So you, I think spent basically the first half of the race somewhere in the sixth to ninth place area. And splits wise, were you matching your splits and doing what you wanted to do?
Croft:Yeah, it was right on my splits right through there. People would say to me, they’re like, “Were you going through a really bad patch?” And I was like, “No. I was doing-”
iRunFar:“I was running my splits.”
Croft:Yeah. And it was good because I had this plan and I knew I was a bit back, but I just didn’t worry. I was just like, “I’m still on my times.” And so yeah.
iRunFar:Was there any uncertainty in… Because I think traditionally you’re a little bit more of an aggressive starter, is that a fair thing to say or…
Croft:I think it was my first UTMB and also I just think when I’d looked at the historical data UTMB, a lot of people positive split the course. And I think it’s-
iRunFar:By a long shot here.
Croft:By a long shot. It’s like get through Courmayeur four hours or sub four hours and then just try and hold it together for the end. And I just didn’t want to do that. I wanted to try to do the opposite.
iRunFar:Yeah. So you came through Courmayeur, I think you were in sixth place at that point. And then spent the next 30 to 40k moving up in position, slowly picking people off, or people came back to you or… Yeah. You must have arrived to Courmayeur fresh enough that part B of the plan, you were able to put that into action.
Croft:Yeah, the goal was to get 3 hours, 10 elapsed to Contamines, I did that. And then it was supposed to be 4:20 in the morning in Courmayeur, which is 10 hours, 20 elapsed. And I was pretty much bang on.
iRunFar:We’re being joined by the rescue service. And you said the goal was to feel fresh. It’s 80k into a race, how did you feel?
Croft:I didn’t feel great at the start. I felt like everyone went out really fast and it was hot. And I just thought ofLudo[vic Pommeret]and how he’s been able to turn it around. So I didn’t worry too much, but I didn’t feel terrible. And then I was actually starting, as the race progressed, I just started feeling better and better.
iRunFar:In where our team members were out on the second half of the course, they all kept reporting that you were running things that other people were hiking. That you were moving quicker than the people in front of you. Did you go into hunt mode or were you chasing splits or what was the mindset for that part?
Croft:So I started when I passedBlandine [L’Hirondel], I think after La Fouly, and then I got a split going up to Champex was thatMarianne [Hogan]was 48 minutes ahead of me, which I was like, “Oh, that’s quite a lot.”
iRunFar:It’s a better real estate there.
Croft:Yeah, I know. But I was feeling good. And then I got told that she had possibly broken her finger and wasn’t able to use poles. And I’d made I think 11 minutes on a climb into her. And so I was like, “Okay, I think if I just keep moving, well, I could possibly pick her up by the end.” But I felt like she took a while to break. I was like, “She’s like a cat with nine lives.”
iRunFar:She’s on life three, four.
Croft:I know. I was like, I got into Champex and got told about the finger. And then I got into Trient and someone said, I don’t know if it’s true or not, they said that she’d sprained her ankle. And then I felt like…
iRunFar:That’s life four.
Croft:Yeah. And then I felt like the time was sitting around 28 minutes I think at Trient.
iRunFar:Okay.
Croft:And then it wasn’t until coming down to Vallorcine, I was able to put eight minutes on her between the last timing point. So I was like, “Okay, I think I can try and catch her.”
iRunFar:Find her at some point.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:And ultimately the pass happened on the top half of the final climb, is that right?
Croft:Yeah, just before, maybe about five minutes before you come out on the ski slope up to Flégère.
iRunFar:Got it. And the way that she talked about that pass was that you looked amazing and she was doing the best that she could and there was just no touching that.
Croft:Well, it’s like I wanted to pass her convincingly so that she didn’t think that she could… She would come back-
iRunFar:“I am going to be my strongest right now.”
Croft:Yeah. And then when she’s out of sight, I’m going to start walking. No, but it was just like I was impressed or pleased with how I was feeling for the back half for the race and I was still able to move decently well.
iRunFar:You came into the finish line. It might be fair to say that you used what you had to give that day.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:You looked like you had a feeling of physical relief, psychological relief. You put it all out there, you used it, you got to the finish in second.
Croft:Yeah, I think I was able to execute where I was at the best race I could have yesterday. Yeah.
iRunFar:You said a few minutes ago that this is your first UTMB.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:Does that mean that there will be other UTMBs?
Croft:You’re likeMartin [Gaffuri], he asked me that on the finish line. I was like, “You need to wait a bit longer.”
iRunFar:You said, “I’m not answering that right now.”
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:“What we do is psychotic,” or something like that.
Croft:Yeah. I think just knowing how it works, how UTMB works and how I think if I could come back and try and improve it, I think that’s what we all do. We always end up back trying to work on things that we felt that didn’t go quite right on the day.
iRunFar:You’ve done a lot of races in a lot of places around the world at this point. You’ve seen what there is to see in trail ultrarunning. Now that you’ve also seen the spectacle of UTMB and been within it and in the front of it, what is this like in comparison to the biggest, craziest other races that you’ve done?
Croft:I think this is probably one of the biggest ones, really. I don’t know what you would compare it to. I think it’s on its own really. It was amazing. The sport all lining out of town, and then at Notre Dame it was like, yeah, it was electric. I’ve never experienced that in any other race. And I think it was pretty special.
iRunFar:Was it cool? Yeah?
Croft:Yeah, it was really cool. But then it was a lot of stimulation at the start of the race and I was like, by the end I was like, “Okay, I’m ready for some chill nighttime miles.”
iRunFar:“I’d like to be out in Italy by myself please.”
Croft:But I was really cool the support we did get. Yeah.
iRunFar:It’s kind of interesting to me because running is the perfect introvert’s sport. You spend many hours in the mountains by yourselves. And then this is literally the polar opposite of that. You’re having an experience and it’s so external, all these people who are living it with you.
Croft:And it’s changed now with live coverage as well because it’s like, especially if you’re the lead female. ForKatie [Schide], she was probably followed the majority of the day, but it’s just the way it makes other people follow along and support and watch it.
iRunFar:You said in your pre-race interview with us that you were pretty stoked that this was the season ender.
Croft:Yeah. It’s been, I think after not making the start line last year, and it’s been quite a big build to get to this point. And yeah, I’m just ready to get unfit and just chill out.
iRunFar:Yeah. And you do pretty cool stuff in the off season. You go home to where you’re from in New Zealand and do some tramping around the mountains.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:And I think a little bit of running still.
Croft:Yeah. When I’m in New Zealand, it’s like when I do probably the biggest volume normally in my base building. But it just doesn’t feel like it’s the main focus like when we are in Europe. Martin’s obviously working at a lot of events and I feel like I’m pretty focused on training as well. So New Zealand, it feels like running takes a back burner, even though it doesn’t really.
iRunFar:Let yourself at least feel more relaxed about it.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:Last question for you. It was really cool, at least for me to see your family on the finish line with you, your dad, mom and sister. It’s, I think, unusual that they get to come and see your events.
Croft:Yeah, they’ve never been to Europe to watch me race and they actually came last year for UTMB. So when I couldn’t make the start, I think that’s the thing I was disappointed about the most because I felt like they’d come all this way, but they actually didn’t care. They had a great time. And so yeah, also Martin’s family was out on course as well with signs.
iRunFar:Aww.
Croft:And I just think it’s a bit more special when you get to share it with people that you care about.
iRunFar:I think I got emotional watching you see your parents because I think you got a little emotional about-
Croft:Yes.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Croft:Well, I don’t know, even it was at the finish line, I was like, it’s just wild what we’ve done, been through three countries and spent the whole night and to get to the finish, to make the lap special.
iRunFar:And also this just edifies that it’s a team sport.
Croft:Yeah, totally. Yeah. And just for me going into Courmayeur knowing I was going to see Martin and then I hadChalkyat Les Contamines, it really gets you through.
iRunFar:Yeah. Speaking of Chalky, did anything happen costumes wise?
Croft:No.
iRunFar:Oh, no.
Croft:I know. I was going into Trient, I was like, “I’m going to see the dinos here.” And then they weren’t there and I was like, “I’m going to see them in Vallorcine.” Didn’t see them and then apparently they didn’t get handed over. There was a miscommunication.
iRunFar:Oh, no. It’s like maybe the dinos didn’t make the flight or something.
Croft:Yeah, no, they were actually in Chamonix, but they just didn’t make it out of-
iRunFar:They didn’t make the…
Croft:… out the bag.
iRunFar:… transfer out to the aid stations. Aww.
Croft:Yeah.
iRunFar:Well, next time. Congratulations to you on your second place finish at the 2024 UTMB. And if you decide to make another lap around this mountain, that’ll be a fun watch.
Croft:Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Meghan.

Baptiste Chassagne Post-2024 UTMB Interview,https://www.irunfar.com/baptiste-chassagne-post-2024-utmb-interview,"France’sBaptiste Chassagneplaced second in the 2024UTMB, an improvement on 10th in last year’s race. In the following interview, our first with Baptiste, he talks about how he moved up the field gradually, only entering the top 10 past the halfway point; what it meant to podium at the biggest race on his home trails; and how he gradually built up over the years to racing 100-mile distances.
For more on how the race played out, read our in-depth2024 UTMB resultsarticle.
﻿﻿﻿
iRunFar:Sarah Brady of iRunFar. It’s the day after the 2024 UTMB. I’m here with second-place man, Baptiste Chassagne. Congratulations, Baptiste. How do you feel?
Chassagne:I feel super great. I feel happy, grateful, and really pleased to be there. It’s quite an honor to be with you, so thank you for the invitation.
iRunFar:We’re delighted to have you. So, you have a history here at this festival. You were top 10 at one of the UTMB races for the last five editions. You started atMCCin 2018, and you worked your way up toOCCandCCC, and then you were 10th at UTMB last year.
Chassagne:Yes.
iRunFar:But then, that was quite a big jump to your performance this year to place second.
Chassagne:Yeah.
iRunFar:So, did anything change massively in your training in the last year?
Chassagne:I don’t think so. I think that the performance of yesterday is just the result of a whole process that I started five or six years ago. Yesterday, I just had a really good day. Yeah, it’s a kind of concretization of all the process. There is perhaps a change of mindset. Jumping in the Nike journey, it also change the way of your thinking, or your thoughts.
iRunFar:Okay.
Chassagne:Last year, I was leading the[Trail Running] World Championships [Long Trail]. I was first at the middle aid station. I have been really anxious about leading the race because I was not designed for that. And to jump into the Nike project, it changed the way of how you see the performance. So, when I was second yesterday, okay, I can manage the pace, I can manage the thoughts.
iRunFar:Yeah, I think the psychology of 100 milers is a key part to it. So, you were saying just before we started, so you were 10th last year, but you’re an hour and 20 minutes faster this year. On a slightly longer course as well. But you said your splits were pretty much the same until Courmayeur. So, you had a really good second half. And I noticed you were still in 11th at Courmayeur. You’ve been gradually creeping up the whole race. Was that always the plan to run a conservative first half?
Chassagne:No, there was no plan. The only… I don’t know how to say that, but I really wanted to be really listening to my sensation, my feelings, and I never watched my watch, in regards to my watch. So, I was very focusing on the pace. So, there was no strategy, and then it was just super natural.
iRunFar:Cool. And then, in the second half, you’re gradually picking off runners. And was it a game to get the next one, and the next one, or did it just happen naturally?
Chassagne:Yeah, that’s the thing I really love in ultrarunning, it’s like playing chess. Every move is really important. So, I know if I push in this uphill, perhaps I will pay for that in the next downhill. So playing chess with the other competitors is something I really liked.
iRunFar:Very good. And did you actually run alongside anyone for a significant time, or were you on your own mostly?
Chassagne:Yeah, withHannes Namberger, who finished fourth.
iRunFar:Very good.
Chassagne:We have, I don’t know how to say that, but a feeling and intuition with Hannes, which is an athlete I really, really appreciate because we share a lot of kilometers during the last World Championships.
iRunFar:Oh, very good.
Chassagne:And we share some partners together. So, it was really cool. We jumped from the nine position to the podium together in 50k, so-
iRunFar:Yeah.
Chassagne:… good company.
iRunFar:I think you’re both similar runners in that Hannes is very consistent as well.
Chassagne:Yeah.
iRunFar:Yeah. And very patient.
Chassagne:Yeah.
iRunFar:And then it was around the top of Trient where you moved into second place. And how did you feel there?
Chassagne:I don’t know. It was like, last year, I suffered a lot in UTMB. On my mindset, my keyword was, “Okay, I don’t want to suffer like last year.” So, I always want to keep this little margin. I didn’t want to go in the red zone, stay in the orange zone. And when I jumped into the second position, I had still this little margin, and I just wanted to keep the pace with the little margin until the last uphill. So yeah… I felt confidence.
iRunFar:And he was always quite close behind you, but you were still comfortable with the gap you had?
Chassagne:Yeah, it was a really, really big fight. In my dreams, I think that’s a dream of every trail runner. It’s like crossing the roads of Chamonix-
iRunFar:Of course.
Chassagne:… like, yeah, giving high-fives and everything. So, I imagined something different for my UTMB, like dreaming finish line-
iRunFar:Yeah, amazing.
Chassagne:… because I had to sprint until the last-
iRunFar:Oh, wow. Okay.
Chassagne:… 100 meters. So, it was not disappointing, but something different.
iRunFar:It is not what you expected.
Chassagne:Yeah, exactly.
iRunFar:That’s dramatic.
Chassagne:No, but that was really cool too.
iRunFar:Okay. Very good.
Chassagne:Surprising, but really cool.
iRunFar:Yeah, nice. And then, there’s something at the finish that confused a lot of us, the paddle.
Chassagne:Yeah.
iRunFar:What was that about?
Chassagne:It’s like kind of signature for two reasons. First, I consider myself not as a God-gifted athlete, more like a hard worker, not with so much talents. In my opinion, I have to row a lot-
iRunFar:Oh, okay.
Chassagne:… to achieve things and to achieve my dreams. So, that’s the first explanation. And the second one is that I really love football, soccer, and the signature of one of my favorite players is rowing when he scores a goal. So, the guy-
iRunFar:Okay. Who is that?
Chassagne:Marama Vahirua. He’s a really small player, in fact, not a small player, but a team player. He’s not a star. He comes from a small island called Tahiti.
iRunFar:Hopefully, he sees this.
Chassagne:Yeah.
iRunFar:Okay. And then, just from looking at your progression, even this past year, you’ve still done a lot of short trail races, but you’ve done incredibly well at the biggest 100-mile race in the world. So now, are you going to try and focus more on this 100-mile distance, or do you still like to do a bit of everything?
Chassagne:From the scratch, I mean, when I started to trail, I really wanted to become an ultrarunner. But I am really, really well-surrounded by my coach, my manager, my family, and everyone was telling me, “Okay, you have to be patient. So, you have to build this legs that will allow you to dream big at UTMB.”
As you mentioned for Hannes, consistency is a key. So, I just want to go passionately, and yeah, and my ambition is to become one of the best ultrarunner in the world.
iRunFar:Well, you’re here in second place on the UTMB podium, so I think you’ve already achieved that. And then, just finally, so I know you’re local to the area. Do you have a ski season or anything in winter?
Chassagne:Yes. I think that to be a local boy helped me a lot yesterday, about two or three things. First, I really know every trails.
iRunFar:Very good.
Chassagne:I mean, this is my playground, so I felt really confident to run at home. And then, I also had a lot of, lot of love and sharings from everyone. I really felt the extra power of being at home, running at home.
iRunFar:And what will you do now?
Chassagne:And about skiing season, I’m sorry. So, that’s why I live here. I really love to do a sport that the nature imposes you. So, when it’s winter, I really love to do mountaineering, skiing.
iRunFar:Okay. And the combination seems to work very well for a lot of athletes.
Chassagne:Yes.
iRunFar:Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks very much. It was great to have you-
Chassagne:Thank you.
iRunFar:… for your first of many iRunFar interviews.
Chassagne:Thank you so much.
iRunFar:Thank you.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m with Katie Schide. It’s the day after the 2024 UTMB and you’re the champion again. Congratulations, Katie. Good morning.
Schide:Thank you. Yeah, it’s nice to be awake and walking around.
iRunFar:How does it feel? You’re the champion of this race for the second time.
Schide:It’s a bit surreal, to be honest. It’s a race I always dreamed of winning a few years ago, and then to finally be able to put together a good day in 2022 was more than I could have asked for. And then to be able to come back and have another great run at it was… kind of still sinking in I guess.
iRunFar:You have the feelings in your legs, but maybe not your mind yet.
Schide:Yeah, I think there’s been a lot to do since finishing, so not much time to soak it in yet.
iRunFar:It is a blessing and a curse of winning the largest 100 miler out there is that there are people like us who want to talk to you for a long time the next day. Right?
Schide:Yeah. This isn’t too long. It’s okay.
iRunFar:I want to start with something you said at the finish line yesterday that hit me. You said that in 2022 you were nervous about going out fast. You didn’t know if you’d be able to stick it. But this year you had a different sense of confidence in your ability to run. Will you tell us a little more about that?
Schide:Yeah, there was a lot going on just before the start in 2022 where I had to move houses because we had a COVID case in our house and there was just a lot going on emotionally and also logistically, and I kind of got to the start line just sort of like, all right. Honestly, I was kind of convinced I had COVID. I had done COVID tests, but I still didn’t believe them and thought for sure.
iRunFar:It was going to happen in Champex-Lac or in Les Chapieux or something.
Schide:Yeah. It did for my partner. So I wasn’t far off, but so I kind of just was like, okay, let’s just go for it, and sort of just this mindset of like, well, I don’t really care. It’s probably not going to work anyway. And then when I was running quite fast, everyone was sort of concerned for me. I could feel that feeling from other people.
iRunFar:She’s going too fast possibly.
Schide:Yea,h because my previous two UTMBs had not been that fast, and I guess I hadn’t shown a performance at that level before, so I think people are a bit like, oh, maybe you should be a little bit more conservative. Even if they were cheering, I could still feel it.
iRunFar:You could feel it a little.
Schide:And it kind of freaked me out. I was like, oh no, maybe I really made a huge mistake here. Which it’s hard to say in hindsight if it was a good idea or a bad idea, in the end worked out. But this year I had written those times down for the first couple aid stations.
iRunFar:Were you using the 2022 splits?
Schide:Yeah, it was just as a check to make sure I wasn’t going super fast or much slower than them. I wanted to be kind of around that because I thought at this point, I think I can run those kind of times more comfortably than I did in 2022. But yeah, I just had more confidence about it, so because I knew the time in Saint-Gervais, I knew that the guys weren’t running very fast, so when I was with the first guys, I knew, yeah, of course you can always run fast at the start, but I felt like, okay, I don’t think I’m making too big of a mistake because I know I did this in 2022 and the guys were 10 or 15 minutes ahead of me. So trying not to judge my own effort based on where they were.
iRunFar:Did it feel hot to you in starting and did the night feel hotter to you? Sort of digging into some of the details. Was it any different than prior UTMBs?
Schide:It’s always really humid at the start.
iRunFar:Why is it so humid?
Schide:I think it’s just the time of year. The afternoons here are always humid, and then we’re really in the trees between Saint-Gervais, and Les Contamines, and you’re next to the river. So yeah, there’s a lot of humidity there. I didn’t find it that different from the other three times. And then during the night it was kind of normal, maybe a little bit warmer than 2022 and 2021 was quite cold also, maybe similar to 2019, but nothing crazy and it was super clear, no fog. I think we had really, really good weather.
iRunFar:It felt like the night time was almost the most pleasant night. There was no fog that your headlamp is trying to reflect off of. Most people were wearing one layer, sometimes there’s two layers out at night. It seemed like a really a charming night for running.
Schide:Yeah, it was nice. It was very manageable. It was like a few chilly points where I pulled down my sleeves or I put my jacket on just one time, I think.
iRunFar:If you look back at the Katie Schide racing style of a few years ago, it was often that you would run early in the race with other people. Sometimes you’d share kilometers and kilometers with some of your friends. But it seems like the Katie Schide of 2024 is front running off the start where you’re sort of in no other woman’s land, with other men. How has that change felt for you, not being as surrounded with women and passing the miles with other people this year?
Schide:Yeah, I think the last time I really ran with people at the start wasCourtney [Dauwalter]at Western States last year. And otherwise, I don’t remember, I guess at UTMB in previous years, but I think that’s just because that’s where I was at and that was my effort was to be with them. I’ve also, for sure, gained a lot of confidence in the last, let’s see, six years since my firstCCC. So yeah, just being more sure of my own decision making. Unfortunately, there aren’t as many women to run with as men, so you don’t have as many options for pacing. So at this point, it’s actually great because I do know most of the men in the field and can speak to some of the French guys, so I feel like I have a lot of options for people to run with. Even if I don’t want to talk, it’s nice to know you could say something.
iRunFar:Or you have the company of somebody, even if you’re not talking.
Schide:Yeah.
iRunFar:Yeah. I guess from the outside looking in, things looked like they were pretty smooth for you until maybe the last 20 or 25 kilometers, or rather, were you managing things that just weren’t that detectable from the outside?
Schide:I’m always managing my stomach, but it was manageable until the last two hours then I had a lot of cramping. I’m not sure if it was more my stomach or my diaphragm or both. But yeah, that was really hard. That’s basically what-
iRunFar:Took you out.
Schide:That’s what was holding me back in the last couple hours.
iRunFar:Was it cramps or just like bonking, no energy?
Schide:It was really intense stomach cramps. Yeah. I had to stop a few times to try to breathe because I wasn’t sure why I couldn’t inhale very deeply. But I was able to just keep moving. I could see I was still moving and not too slowly, so I just wanted to hold it together.
iRunFar:Like doing the pace that you needed to maintain your position as far as Chamonix.
Schide:Yeah, I knew my position was going to be fine. I more had some of those time goals in mind at that point, but I tried to just to be happy with what I was doing and not get too stressed.
iRunFar:Last question for you. There’s been this Western States-UTMB double thing that’s been a part of your summer, probably when Western States ended there was the relief of having accomplished that goal, but maybe your brain started doing the math and stuff on UTMB pretty quick. Is there today, now, both goals accomplish, mission accomplish? Can you let yourself feel like, yeah, end of season relief accomplishment?
Schide:Yeah, I am excited to start doing that. I feel like maybe once we get home and I have some time to breathe a little bit more, decompress. I’ve only spent three weeks at home since mid-April, so I think I’m just looking forward to being in my place and calm. Yeah, because when you bring that up, it still really isn’t something that’s totally sunk in yet. So yeah.
iRunFar:Congratulations on your win of the 2024 UTMB. Congratulations on the Western States-UTMB double, and congratulations on an off-season of sitting on the couch, relaxing-
Schide:Skiing.
iRunFar:Skiing, letting that all sink in.
Schide:Thanks.

﻿﻿﻿
iRunFar:Sarah Brady of iRunFar, I’m here just the day after the 2024 UTMB with men’s champion Vincent Bouillard. Vincent, how are you?
Bouillard:Pretty good, thanks. Honestly, not too bad.
iRunFar:Okay. And you won UTMB, how does that feel?
Bouillard:Yeah, I don’t know that it hit quite yet. It will take a while for sure, at least a couple of days to fully sink in, but I think just taking it one thing at a time and mostly being able to enjoy it with friends and family was so special and going through lots of text messages and things, honestly, it’s pretty special.
iRunFar:Okay, that’s amazing. It’s amazing as a French runner as well, to win your big home race.
Bouillard:Yeah, I think UTMB has gotten so big now and it has a pretty broad impact even outside of France. But yeah, I guess arriving and it’s when towards the end of the last eight stations where people are starting to single along with my name, I was like, oh, okay it’s something I hadn’t anticipated for that.
iRunFar:Yeah, something very special. And just because this is our first interview at you, we’d just like a little background on you as a runner so I could find trail races going back about 10 years. And before that were you a track runner or a road runner, what’s your background?
Bouillard:I’ve run track. So for context in France, sport in school is very small, almost inexistent compared to the U.S. where it’s so big and a big deal if you do a sport with your school. So I’ve run track and cross country, but not at any super competitive level. I have lots of friends that did much better than I did, but also I grew up in this area and I’ve always had just a lots of inspiration to go spend time outside and whether it was hiking with my grandparents when I was a little kid or cycling, skiing in the winter, I’ve always been very active overall and never super competitive per se.
iRunFar:Okay, very good. So you’ve always been in the mountains?
Bouillard:Yeah, a little bit.
iRunFar:Okay. I’ve seen you’ve raced a bit in the U.S., you won theGorge Waterfalls 100klast year, and then I think you won theKodiak 100 milerby two hours.
Bouillard:Yes, yes. So I met my wife actually here at UTMB the first time in 2017 and then 2018.
iRunFar:Happy anniversary.
Bouillard:Thank you. She was at Hoka at the time, but we had done long distance for a bit and then I moved to the U.S. both to move in with her and pursue a professional opportunity with Hoka, but I think Gorge Waterfall came the right time of post COVID, no racing period. And also we had just moved to Portland, Oregon as part of a new office opening for Hoka, and it was a race that sounded really cool to participate because the Free Trail team,Dylan [Bowman]not really putting it on, and trails are just amazing up there. So that was a cool one and already the thought was to try and get towards, okay, what would it take to get to UTMB?
iRunFar:Okay, amazing. And then you moved back here earlier this year?
Bouillard:Yes, we just moved back. Well move for my wife, but move back for me in April, so very recently.
iRunFar:You’re different to a lot of the men’s top runners because you’re racing mostly against professional full-time athletes, but you have a full-time job with Hoka. So how does your training work around that? Do you think you do less volume than some of the others, or how do you fit it in?
Bouillard:I don’t know everyone’s schedule specifically. I’m not too much into looking at what everyone is doing super precisely. We have enough friends that do that sport very, very competitively. So I know roughly what the levels are. For me, I try to adapt with how my schedule allows, not just with work, but also other things in life.
iRunFar:Of course.
Bouillard:I absolutely love running and trail running, but it’s also very important for me and for us to have balance with other things. And sometimes we have weekend plans that do not involve any sort of running activity, that’s coming up in the next few weeks. It’s going to be very exciting.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Bouillard:But then my work schedule also allow me to be a bit flexible with maybe I don’t have always a nine to five very precise thing. I think Hoka as a company has, especially in the last few years post COVID, made it very clear that employees should take the time even it’s in the middle of the day to go do their workout or things. So yeah, just definitely leaning into that and trying to make things relevant from the different aspects.
iRunFar:Then just to talk about the race. So you weren’t like someone who started in the middle and crept up, you were in the top 10 from the go. So in the opening part of the race, was that the plan for you to just try to stay in touch with the front runners or were you just running your own race and that’s where you ended up?
Bouillard:Maybe a bit of both. I had ideas of what my splits were supposed to be, and so it’s funny because I’d never run this course, but I know it so well because I’ve followed this race so many times. So I was not going in the full unknown, and I didn’t feel like I was going way too fast. According to my splits, in fact, I was thinking that some runners will go a lot faster at the beginning, so I was surprised to be withTom [Evans]and then Jim[Walmsley]on the run towards Les Contamines. But then I also was very focused on how am I feeling, what is the right pacing for me? Actually, right after Les Contamines, I took maybe a little longer than others at the aid station, and I took the next climb up to Col dui Bonhommme rather easily. So another group caught up on me,Katie Schidecaught up on me as well. And it’s not until the following climb up to Col de la Seigne that I started to feel better and then I moved up.
iRunFar:Okay. And then when you first found yourself in podium position, how did that play out? Was it a case of you hunting down the runners in front, or did people just naturally come back to meet you?
Bouillard:Yeah, it’s funny because as I was saying, I was really trying to focus on how I was feeling and what pacing was right for what I thought I could sustain for 20 plus hours. I was not going… It was like, I’m going to run under 20.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Bouillard:But I guess starting at Col de la Seigne I caught up with a lot of runners and then eventually caught the… Well, Jim was still in the front, but caughtGermain [Grangier], Tom,Ben [Dhiman], and I can’t remember who. There were four of them, but I felt really easy. Then when I was following them in the group, I felt really comfortable on the climbs and the descents. So I still don’t remember if I wanted to put an attack or if I just wanted to get in the front of that group, but naturally I was just climbing faster when I didn’t have someone in front of me. So then I caught up on Jim, and that’s where I realized like, oh, that means that now I’m taking the lead.
iRunFar:Okay, wow. And then it was around Courmayeur at halfway where you found yourself in front. And how did that feel? Was it scary? Was there a new pressure in the race then?
Bouillard:I think I was really… Even when I eventually realized, okay, that means that now I’m in the front, I kept focusing on how am I feeling and what does that mean for my own race and my pacing. And I was trying to put aside the fact that, okay, for now I’m in the lead, but maybe two hours from now I’m going to feel like crap and I’ll have to deal with a big crisis moment. So if I take five minutes or three minutes on this climb, those are three minutes that I took and they’re with me. So I think that’s the mindset that I had is like, okay, for now I know that I’m not overdoing it. I’m using reasonable pacing for me and be in that mindset of if things are going well, expect that they’re not going to go well for that much longer and prepare for when they’re not going well.
iRunFar:Okay, that sounds like a good strategy because you can very easily lose an hour in this race towards the end if you don’t take the three minutes when you need it.
Bouillard:Yeah. I think we were discussing with some friends of how, especially with the timing of the start at 6 p.m., the fact that it’s a night race for the elite field, everyone goes through rough patches, it’s compared to, I don’t know,Western Statesthis year where it’s felt like everyone has it fully dialed and it’s on the entire time. At UTMB, you have to navigate maybe more parameters with temperature change, not this year as much, but a little bit.
iRunFar:There’s a lot of variables. And then for a time past Courmayeur and almost as far as Vallorcine, you were ahead of course, record pace. Were you just trying to ignore that and keep cool?
Bouillard:Yeah.
iRunFar:Okay, yeah. And were people telling you the whole time?
Bouillard:I think I was still in that same mindset of at some point I’m going to fall apart and I’ll have to manage that.
iRunFar:Okay, but you didn’t really.
Bouillard:Well, yeah, I think I was trying to get information on what the splits were behind to just get an idea of, okay, am I putting more gap or are they coming back on me? But I had this firm idea that at some point I’m going to not be able to hold the pace because I was dividing by section. I was like, okay, I’m going to push the climb up to Col Gran Ferret, and then the whole descent, okay, if I feel good, I’ll try and push, push, push. But I was not thinking of the timing, the final time. I think maybe as I got closer I was like, wait, how much is left? How much do I have time? Okay, maybe I can finish under 20 hours, and just that I think Jim deserves to have this course record, to be honest. And I think also that the course might change a little bit from year to year, but as I got closer, I was like, it would be really cool to run under 20 hours for sure.
iRunFar:Of course. Yeah, it’s amazing. And then how was the final descent into Chamonix and running through the town?
Bouillard:So I now, famously because of the Flégère [foreign language 00:10:44] station, I forgot a flask at Vallorcine, I did have my full capacity because I had a Ziploc that is also capacity to carry water, but I was very dehydrated on the climb up to La Flégère. I think with the heat and all the people around was starting to get a little just dizzy and with dehydration. And so with that context, I was even more focused on not falling, not tripping on anything and I ended up tripping on a rock literally in the last minute on the descent, just before we got on the road.
iRunFar:So you just fell into town?
Bouillard:I didn’t fall, but I hit really hard and it was actually super painful for the first part of my run into town. So I was like, oh no, it’s ruining the moment of just emotion.
iRunFar:That’s funny, because the women’s leader finished hobbling as well.
Bouillard:Yeah, at first I was like, I just literally broke my toe, there’s no other way. This is so painful. But I prefer that it happened in the last mile than in the first.
iRunFar:Yeah, for sure. And then I know you’ve probably just taken time to absorb all of this, but have you thought about the rest of the season? Is there another race in you or is this it?
Bouillard:Season as in calendar year? No, right now I’m really looking forward to not having our schedule revolved around my training and having other things that we set on the agenda. We were discussing we just moved here from the States and we actually have some friends coming to visit and we have a new apartment that we’re building out and stuff. So it’s nice to have other areas of focus and I’ll take the time today just before thinking of other things that I’ll put on racing calendar and whatnot. That will come when it comes, but not now.
iRunFar:Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Thanks so much for fitting us in. I’m sure you’re very into demand today and enjoy your recovery.
Bouillard:Thank you so much. Yeah, pleasure talking to you.
iRunFar:You too.

2024 UTMB Results: A Course Record for Schide and a Surprise Win for Bouillard,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-utmb-results,"For the front of the field, the 2024UTMBis already history. The iconic UTMB course, with its 176 kilometers (109.3 miles) and almost 10,000 meters (32,500 feet) of elevation gain, has crowned new champions, as more than 2,500 runners try to encircle the Mont Blanc massif from Chamonix, France, through Italy and Switzerland, before finishing back in Chamonix.
In the women’s race, AmericanKatie Schidemade sure there were no similar surprises at the top of the podium. In a commanding, nearly wire-to-wire victory, Schide crossed the finish line in 22:09:31 to breakCourtney Dauwalter’scourse record by 21 minutes, secure her second win at UTMB, and complete the Western States 100-UTMB double in the span of just over two months.
“When I went out fast this year, I wasn’t afraid like I was in 2022,” Schide said after the race, referring to the first year she won UTMB. “From two more years of training, I had the confidence to run my splits.”

KiwiRuth Croftand CanadianMarianne Hoganfinished in second and third, respectively, for a strong podium.
At the finish line in Chamonix,Vincent Bouillardput his hands on his head in disbelief and smiled toward the crowd: He had done it.
In one of the biggest — and most unexpected — breakthroughs in the history of the storied race, Bouillard, an unsponsored Frenchman who works in research and development for Hoka, won the 2024 UTMB in 19:54:23, to become the fifth runner to break the mythical 20-hour mark and cement his name in race lore.
“Winning UTMB was never expected,” said Bouillard, a former track and field athlete turned trail runner. “I’ve been coming to this race since almost the beginning for my work, but only in my wildest dreams would I win it.”

Those wildest dreams became reality on a hot day in France, which saw several of the pre-race favorites, including AmericanJim Walmsley, the U.K.’sTom Evans, and FrenchmanGermain Grangier, drop out. Bouillard, along with second- and third-place finishersBaptiste Chassagneof France andJoaquín Lópezof Ecuador but living in Spain, took advantage of the opportunity to complete a podium that perhaps not many people predicted. But that, of course, is the beauty of ultrarunning, especially at a race as competitive and deep as UTMB.
A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of UTMB possible!

After finally breaking through to become the first American man to win UTMB last year — with a course record, no less —Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) entered this year’s race as one of the clear favorites. He had also won, for the fourth time, the Western States 100 in late June to set up an attempt to become the first man sinceKilian Jornetin 2011 to win the Western States 100-UTMB double.
In his pre-race interview, Walmsley projected calmness and perspective. “The cards that I have in my hand this year are different,” he said, “but also, I wouldn’t be lining up if I didn’t think I had a chance to compete up front.”
And for nearly nine hours, that’s exactly what he did. Walmsley, wearing bib No. 2, started with the pack but took the lead by 35k as the climbing — and night — set in. He ran at the front for the next several hours, stopping for two minutes at the Les Chapieux aid station (51k), and came into Lac Combal (70k) looking strong and still in the lead, leaving in less than 90 seconds.

But between there and Courmayeur at 83k, he began to struggle, dropping nine places to 10th and 13 minutes off the lead. As he entered the large aid station that serves as the near halfway point of the race, he looked rough. While the race leaders were efficient with their stops, Walmsley sat to eat for a relatively long time and did not look like he wanted to get up. He would later officially drop, a tough conclusion to a promising race for the champion. Winning the Western States 100-UTMB double still seems to be one of the most challenging feats in men’s ultrarunning.
“Jim has been struggling to shake a knee injury since Western States,” reada post on his Instagram story, “but wanted to give himself the chance to see what the day would give him.”
Walmsley was not the only of the pre-race favorites to drop out. The U.K.’sTom Evans(pre-race interview) — who followed up a third-place finish at the 2022 UTMB by winning the Western States 100 last year — had a very similar race to Walmsley, running near the front for the first half of the race and entering Courmayeur in second. He was part of a large chase pack that had passed Walmsley by 83k and spent less than three minutes at the large aid station, leaving in third behind FrenchmanGermain Grangier(pre-race interview) and eventual championVincent Bouillard(post-race interview), another Frenchman.

By Refuge Bertone at 88k, though, he began to look fatigued and though he remained in the top five until 101k, by Grand Col Ferret at 106k he had dropped 23 places to 28th. He would also later drop — another top contender out of the race.
“Tom has sadly had to withdraw. He is okay and with family and friends,” read apost on his Instagram story. “Fueling became an issue through the night and you can’t run this race on empty.”
The carnage, unfortunately, did not stop there, either. Grangier looked strong for more than 115k, running in second and charging up the hill at Grand Col Ferret at 106k and looking calm at La Fouly 10 kilometers later, only six minutes behind Bouillard. He stayed in second as the morning came, but looked fatigued by Trient at 146k, where he would also drop.
FrenchmenMathieu Blanchard, who famously battled Jornet at the2022 UTMB for a second-place finish, andAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-race interview), whowon both the Hardrock 100and Diagonal des Fous in 2023, both dropped at 69k, while Spain’sPau Capell, the2019 UTMB winner, dropped at Courmayeur like Walmsley.

None of this is to take away from the brilliance of Bouillard or the other top finishers, who survived the historic carnage and heat to come away with some performances of a lifetime.
It starts and ends, of course, with Bouillard, who was on few people’s radar when the race began. Last year, Bouillard, who does not even have a photo on hisofficial UTMB page, won the Kodiak 100 mile and Gorge Waterfall 100k, but few expected him to compete at the world’s most competitive trail race.
He did exactly that. Wearing bib No. 139, Bouillard ran in the lead pack at the start of the race, coming through Refuge de la Croix du Bonhomme at 46k in ninth, and methodically working his way up to the front, entering Lac Combal at 70k in second. By Courmayeur, he had taken the lead and spent less than three minutes refueling before heading back into the early morning darkness.
From there, he would not relinquish the lead, running the rest of the race relatively unchallenged as he continued to look strong and smooth as the sun rose. Later in the morning, he would cross the finish line to seal a strong and surprising win.

While Bouillard won by nearly 30 minutes, there was a true race behind him. France’sBaptiste Chassagne(post-race interview) ran in the top 20 for most of the first 60k and entered Courmayeur in 11th. By 129k, he and fellow FrenchmanArthur Joyeux-Bouillon, who had taken the opposite approach by running at or near the front from the start, were within seconds of each other in fourth and fifth place, respectively, and 34 minutes behind Bouillard. Chassagne continued to look and run strong, entering Trient at 146k in second just ahead of the Ecuadorian living in Spain,Joaquín López(post-race interview), where he would remain until he crossed the finish line in 20:22:45 for his most impressive finish of his six-year streak of a top 10 at a UTMB Mont Blanc festival race.

López, meanwhile, had a very similar race to Chassagne, running in the top 30 at the start of the race before moving into 10th position by the time he left Courmayeur. Over the final half of the race, he moved up even further, and was just four minutes behind Chassagne at 161k. He could not ultimately catch him, but he did hold off Germany’sHannes Namberger(pre-race interview) to finish third in 20:26:22.

Namberger, a two-time top-10 finisher at UTMB, had another strong race to finish fourth in 20:31:54, looking like he might nab a spot in the top three with a fast finish.
The agelessLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) of France, who just over a month agoset the course record at the Hardrock 100, had another stellar performance, moving up from 47th at 40k, all the way to 10th by 100k, before picking off several runners in front of him to finish fifth in 20:57:48. It was his second straight fifth-place finish.
Joyeux-Bouillon held on for sixth, while AmericanCody Lindran into seventh position. Spots eight through 10 — Spain’sManuel Anguita Bayoalong with FrenchmenGautier BonnecarrèreandYannick Noël— were separated by only four minutes, with Bonnecarrère and Noël appearing to tie for ninth in 21:45:16.

Just two months ago,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), an American living in France,led the Western States 100 from wire to wire and nearly broke the course record en route to a commanding win. On Saturday in France, Schide somehow improved on that performance: She again won in dominating fashion, but this time also nabbed the course record to cap one of the most impressive doubles in ultrarunning history. (Of course, last year,Courtney Dauwalter, who did not race UTMB this year, won each race in the Western States 100-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple.)
In her pre-race interview, Schide, who lives and trains in France, admitted that her primary focus this season was on the Western States 100 and that she took the runner’s insurance for UTMB when she signed up in January in case she canceled.
After she dominated an impressively deep and competitive field on Saturday, though, it was hard to believe UTMB was not the top race on her calendar this year.

Schide went out fast and kept that assertive pace for nearly an entire day of running. She was 21st overall at the first aid station at 13k; New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Canadian living in FranceMarianne Hogan(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the eventual second- and third-place finishers were, respectively, 118th and 72nd overall there.
Schide did not take her foot off the gas and continued to run with her characteristic calm, strength, and smile, entering the Lac Combal aid station at 70k in 7:34, looking focused. By Courmayeur at 83k, she was 50 minutes under course-record pace and nearly 40 minutes ahead of Hogan, and by La Fouly at 116k, she was nearly an hour under record pace.
The only question from there was if she would set the record. With Hogan losing 10 minutes in 12 kilometers by 141k to fall to 40 minutes back, Schide’s win seemed close to inevitable, especially with the way she was running. Just before Vallorcine at 158k, Schide’s lead on the course record had lessened to 32 minutes and a few kilometers later she was working hard and taking encouragement from fans. With four kilometers to go, she smiled as the crowds cheered her on, knowing that history was just minutes away.
She reached Chamonix and the celebration began. Schide smiled to the crowd and gave several high fives before crossing the finish line more than 20 minutes faster than any woman had done before, and the double was complete.

If Schide was chasing history, Croft was chasing dozens of runners in front of her. Croft, who was forced to withdraw before the start of last year’s race due to illness, came into UTMB as one of the favorites, having won the Tarawera Ultramarathon and Transvulcania earlier this year. She ran conservatively at the start, coming through 31k in sixth place next to AmericanAmanda Basham, 22 minutes off the lead, and later falling to ninth place almost 38 minutes back just over 10 kilometers later.
But by 88k, with about half of the race in front of her, Croft had moved up to fifth, next toEmily Hawgoodof Zimbabwe, who lives in the U.S, and from there she kept moving up. At the Grand Col Ferret at 106k, she was in fourth behind Schide, Hogan, and2023 third-place finisherBlandine L’Hirondelof France, but Croft did not hang around: She broke into a run as soon as she started the descent.

By 129k, she had passed L’Hirondel and was in third place, looking fast and determined. At Trient, 17 kilometers later and about a half-hour behind Hogan, Croft was the only woman to run through the entire section and looked to be on the hunt.
By 158k, she had cut Hogan’s lead to 14 minutes and looked the stronger of the two, flying downhill and making up time. Between there and the climb up to La Flégère, Croft finally passed Hogan and left six minutes ahead. With four kilometers to go, she was in second and flying to the finish. She’d reach it in 22:48:37, just over 22 minutes ahead of Hogan, in her debut at the race.
Hogan,who finished second in her 2022 UTMB debut, had another strong race, running in second for most of the day with a smile on her face, before fading late. She didn’t let falling to third dampen her spirits, high-fiving fans and enjoying their cheers at La Floria four kilometers from the finish after being passed by Croft. After crossing the line in 23:11:15, she was greeted by a large team at the finish to celebrate her second podium finish in three years.

Behind the top three, there were more strong performances. China’sLin Chenfinished fourth in 24:16:33, while L’Hirondel put it all on the line for a fifth-place finish. The ever-smiling Hawgood, a paragon of consistency who seemingly always finishes in the top 10 of major trail races, was about 22 minutes behind her in sixth with a time of 24:58:19, her third top-10 finish at UTMB and fastest by more than an hour-and-a-half.

That theme of speed was exemplified by the quartet ofSabrina Stanleyof the U.S.,Claudia Trempsof Spain,Martina Valmassoiof Italy, andLucy Bartholomewof Australia, who finished in seventh through 10th, respectively, with a spread of only 23 minutes. And perhaps there are no better illustrations of the depth of the women’s field than Stanley, who passed Tremps late to improve her time from last year’s ninth-place finish by roughly 90 minutes, and Bartholomew, who finished in 10th for the second year in a row — but with a time 1 hour and 45 minutes faster than last year’s.

Pre-race favoriteToni McCann(South Africa, living in France) led early with onlyMartyna Młynarczyk(Poland) in reach. The two were less than a minute apart 16 miles into the race. McCann, the 2023 OCC winner, was expected to be here, but Młynarczyk was a surprise this high up. She was sixth at the Tenerife Bluetrail by UTMB 73k earlier this year, but also a standout Ironman triathlete. A chase group led by 2023 fourth-placerHau Ha Thi(Vietnam),Jazmine Lowther(Canada), andHeather Jackson(U.S.) was over seven minutes back.
McCann’s lead swelled as she climbed through Italy up to the Grand Col Ferret. She was now nearly four minutes up on Młynarczyk and over 10 minutes on everyone else. Lowther fell back to seventh on the climb and would later drop from the race, and Jackson moved up to third.Holly Page(U.K.) entered the top five, 17 minutes behind the race leader.
Roughly halfway into the race at mile 34 in Champex-Lac, Switzerland, it was still McCann and, boldly, Młynarczyk at the front with a big gap on everyone else. McCann led Młynarczyk by almost three minutes, and everyone else was at least 14 minutes behind Młynarczyk. Ha Thi was again third, Jackson fourth, andRosanna Buchauer(Germany) had moved into fifth 13 minutes in front of a now sixth-place Page.
Ten miles later at mile 44 Trient, Switzerland, McCann and Młynarczyk were still out front, but Buchauer had fallen 22 minutes off the lead, while still third alongside Ha Thi.
Finally, by mile 51 in Vallorcine, France, McCann fully broke free of Młynarczyk. The gap between the first and second runners was now eight minutes, and Buchauer had regained some separation from Ha Thi. Buchauer was six minutes ahead of fourth-place Ha Thi.
At the top of the last climb, La Flégère, the positions were set. It was just a four-mile downhill run to Chamonix to go, and McCann, Młynarczyk, and Buchauer kept their podium spots in order.
McCann won in 11:57 in her debut at the 100k distance. Młynarczyk finished a breakout run in second at 12:11. Buchauer was third in 12:16.

Sixteen miles into the race the first 20 men were barely two minutes apart. The group included pre-race favorites likeAdam Peterman(U.S.),Hayden Hawks(U.S.),Manuel Merillas(Spain), andPetter Engdahl(Sweden, living in Norway), among others.
A nearly three-mile climb up to the Grand Col Ferret at mile 19 thinned the pack. Hawks gained a 30-second lead over Peterman and Engdahl, and everyone else fell off the lead group by at least two minutes.
Seth Ruhling(U.S.), the race’s 2023 sixth-place finisher, bridged up and ran into the lead alongside Peterman on the next downhill to La Fouly, Switzerland at mile 25. Hawks was just 22 seconds behind at the checkpoint.
Ruhling dropped from the race shortly later with an ankle injury, Engdahl too, and Hawks passed Peterman five hours into the race when climbing to Champex-Lac. Behind Hawks and Peterman,Huo-Hua Zhang(China) charged in third two minutes behind, andAndreu Simon(Spain) andDan Jones(New Zealand) were over three minutes back in fourth and fifth.
Hawks continued to lead through Trient, Switzerland, seven hours into the day. His training mate Jones briefly moved into second, over three minutes back. Hawks and Jones were third and fourth in June at the Western States 100. Peterman was now third, 50 seconds behind Jones andPeter Fraňo(Slovakia), third at the 2023 Trail World Championships Long Trail, was in fourth now less than two minutes behind Peterman.
Zhang started to fall back climbing to mile 46. He moved to fifth, while Hawks grew his lead. Hawks led Peterman, Jones, and Fraňo by seven, eight, and 10 minutes respectively at that mile 46 timing point.
No one could catch Hawks the rest of the way. He won in 10:20. Hawks won CCC back in 2017 too, then in 10:24.
Fraňo escaped the chase group over the final climb for a second place 10:27, and Peterman was third in 10:28. It was certainly Peterman’s finest result of the year following an injury-filled 2023.

2024 OCC Results: Hemming and Yao Win UTMB 50k World Series Final,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-occ-results-hemming-and-yao-win-utmb-50k-world-series-final,"The 2024OCCrace started at 8:15 a.m. local time on Thursday, August 29. The race links up the towns of Orsières, Switzerland; Champex-Lac, Switzerland; and Chamonix, France — giving it the abbreviated OCC name. It is often referred to as the Little Swiss Sister ofUTMB. This year’s course matched the 2022 track and was longer than last year, when a rockslide closed a section of the traditional course.
The official stats put the course at 57 kilometers (35 miles) with 3,500 meters (11,500 feet) of elevation gain across three big climbs. The race was the UTMB World Series Final for the 50k distance, and that meant €13,000 to each of the winners and prize money going 10 deep. The total OCC prize purse was €76,000.
There were some 1,800 runners from 90 different countries in the race. The hot-weather kit requirements were activated for this year’s race, with temperatures climbing to 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit) range. Runners were required to add sunglasses, a Saharan cap, sunscreen, and extra water capacity to their normally required gear.
You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival:
Christian Allen(U.S.) opened a near-immediate gap on the field at the start and ran alone for nearly all of the race’s first half.
Eli Hemming(U.S.),Benjamin Roubiol(France),Francesco Puppi(Italy), andRémi Bonnet(Switzerland) formed a strong initial chase pack that thinned to just Hemming and Bonnet 90 minutes into the race. At Trient, Switzerland, 15 miles and nearly two hours into the race, Allen led Hemming and Bonnet by two minutes.
The race’s second of three big climbs went up Col de Balme, a mountain pass near the Swiss-French border, and here, Hemming dumped Bonnet and ran down Allen. Three hours into the race, Hemming was clear of the rest.
Behind Hemming, Bonnet dropped after taking a fall, Allen hit a wall, andAntonio Martínez(Spain) made a huge move to leap into second on the Col de Balme climb, though still over six minutes behind the leader, however. He also ran a stirring second half at last year’s race when finishing third.

Puppi found the acceleration up the race’s third and final climb, returning to the lead group for the first time since early in the race. Puppi overtook Martínez to move into second and cut into Hemming’s lead. Hemming ran into trouble on that final climb, briefly stopping near mile 31, but recovered on the downhill finish to maintain his pole position to win in 5:11:48. Puppi was second in 5:14:46, and Martínez was third in 5:17:56.
Hemming became the first American to win OCC, and Puppi and Martínez were both second and third for the second straight year.
For perspective, in 2022 on this same course,Manuel Merillas(Spain) won in 5:18.

Tabor Hemming(U.S.) andDani Moreno(U.S.) led early, butMiao Yao(China) made an aggressive move to the lead on a downhill section less than an hour into the race to take the lead. The surge timing mirrored Yao’s push in last year’s race when she finished third.
Yao’s time alone at the front was short-lived though, and Hemming regained the lead on the climb to La Giète, Switzerland, two hours into the race.Judith Wyder(Switzerland) also overtook Yao on the climb to move into second. When the course again turned downhill into Trient, Switzerland, Yao again charged. Yao, Wyder, and Hemming exited the Trient aid station, 24.3 kilometers into the race, together with two big climbs to go.
Yao broke the group up on the Col de Balme climb, heading up to the course high point at 34 kilometers, and again blasted the downhill right after. She was three two minutes ahead of Wyder at the top, and Hemming would drop from the race further on. Yao led the rest of the race from there, and Wyder stayed in second, too.
Miao Yao celebrates winning the 2024 OCC.
Miao’s winning time was 5:54:03, and Wyder finished in 6:00:05.
Behind those two frontrunners,Clémentine Geoffray(France) ran a super-strong second half to finish third in 6:02:10. Geoffray was the 2023 Trail World Championships 40k winner.
For perspective, the 2022 winning time on this same course was 6:10 bySheila Avilés(Spain).

iRunFar: Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m with Tom Evans. It’s a couple of days before the 2024 UTMB. We find ourselves here again in Chamonix. Hi, Tom.
Evans: Meghan, thank you so much for having me. And yeah, you’ve chosen a wonderful spot and you’ve brought the nice sunshine with you as well.
iRunFar: Well, you are the local here, so I feel like you’re the one who’s more controlling the weather.
Evans: Oui, c’est vrai!
iRunFar: Okay, so you were here at the starting line last year, you’ve been here at the starting line in the past, but I think it’s maybe a different Tom Evans here this year.
Evans: I raced here for the first time in, or for the first UTMB, in 2022 and had…
iRunFar: An amazing race.
Evans: Yeah. It’s very rare that things don’t go wrong in races, and yes, there were some things that didn’t go perfectly, but there was no moment where I thought, “I’m having a really low moment.” And I definitely didn’t find the race easy, but I didn’t really struggle at points. I ran as well as I could have done, and I couldn’t have been happier. So I then came here in 2023, kind of expecting to have the same thing.
iRunFar: A fun little march through the mountains.
Evans: Yeah. By that point, I had doneWestern Statestwice, and had two good results. I’d done UTMB once and had a good result. So I just thought, “Oh, a hundred miles, this is easy.”
iRunFar: I figured out one hundred mile running.
Evans: Exactly. When are having bad days, I’m like, how is…
iRunFar: You just haven’t cracked the nut yet.
Evans: Yeah, exactly, this is… So yeah, I was definitely brought down to earth and realized what a hundred-mile race in the mountains can do because it will chew you up and spit you out. So a very, very different mentality and very different training, both in terms of everything, from locations to the speed work to the sessions that I’ve been doing. Everything this year has been different, and I guess in a way looks similar to my Western States build-up, but very different at the same time. Very similar structure, very similar hours, but fundamentally different because when we talk about training, we talk about you train for the demands of the race.
And everyone can do this, so you can work out, okay, in order to do this race, what have I actually got to be able to do? And then you work backwards from that. Okay, well what do my training sessions look like in order to take me one step closer to what I need to do in this race? So yeah, this year has been, what are the demands of the race? Okay, cool. I know that.
I’ve runCCCtwice, UTMB one and nearly a half times, and I feel like I know what I need to do in order to put myself in a position to have a really good day. But again, it’s 100-mile racing and you try and control what you can control, but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. But yeah, definitely different physically and different mentally, coming into this year.
iRunFar: Last summer, you tried to connect the dots of the gray to Western States-UTMB double, which is just a… This is a tricky race, that’s a tricky race, and then getting them both right in one summer is, I don’t know, one of the hardest things in this sport right now. This year you’re taking, from the outside looking in anyways, a much more traditional 100-mile build. You did start off with a fairly non-traditional winter when it comes to long-distance running. You started with a cross-country season, which is really cool.
Evans: I did. In the UK, and I think in Europe especially, cross country is the fundamentals of running, it’s where I started running, it’s where everyone, in their local running clubs, it’s what you do in winter. And in a way, it’s like trail running because splits don’t really matter. I think the cross-country racing in the US is really cool, but it’s also really fast because a lot of it’s on golf courses, it’s not muddy, it’s typically not hilly. Whereas I’m doing my county championship, my state championships, was around four farmer’s fields, and if you can say four farmer’s fields quickly, you’re doing well.
iRunFar: I will try but I’m proud of you for that.
Evans: And in places, you’re knee-high in mud. So if you feel like you’re running three minutes per kilometer or 5’30” a mile, and actually in reality you’re running seven minutes a mile, and it doesn’t matter because it’s the effort.
iRunFar: You’re trying so hard. Yeah.
Evans: So I guess it’s similar to running in the mountains. Understanding, yes, it’s a short race, it’s 10 kilometers so it’s just over 30 minutes. But yeah, I guess all of those, you don’t worry about those metrics, you just run on feel and it’s a race. It doesn’t matter who’s at the first corner first. Same as here. It doesn’t matter who gets to Les Houches first, it doesn’t matter who gets to Vallorcine first, the winner is the person who gets back to Chamonix first. And I think it’s very similar to cross country. So I also got to race, I’ve raced 13 times this year, that’s probably the most out of anyone. So a lot of them were shorter, 10 kilometers, eight kilometers.
iRunFar: Were nine of them, 10 of them, cross country?
Evans: Yeah, I’ve done three chair races this year.
iRunFar: Okay, cool.
Evans: So it’s been a really cool way. I’ve been able to practice race week. I’ve been able to practice other things that you don’t want to make those mistakes in the day. So yeah, I transitioned from cross country, culminating in racing the cross-country world championships.
iRunFar: You guys did really good there.
Evans: Yeah, we did really good. I had a bit of a niggle going into it, but managed to deal with it and still managed to finish in the top third, which was great. And I was super happy and a really nice well-earned… Yeah, that was the goal for the beginning part of the year. And I then transitioned from there and had five weeks untilTransvulcania. So I recovered and did some training and was really happy with my race in Transvulcania, finishing joint second. I was really worried, I’d not been on training camp, I’d not done any climbing, I’d not done any long descents, but actually the cross-country speed and conditioning I guess had played huge dividends and actually then found it really very straightforward to get back into doing long runs.
iRunFar: That’s interesting.
Evans: It was really interesting. And then-
iRunFar: I guess it’s because you’ve opened up your high end so far that the middle and the lower end just-
Evans: Relatively easy.
iRunFar: Oh, that’s interesting.
Evans: Which is really interesting. So I guess we’ve tried to carry that across, and even now still keeping a little bit of that in. And I was supposed to race atZugspitze, but I didn’t because of this little niggle that was hanging around and finally got that sorted to race Lavaredo. But again, because I had been dealing with this, I hadn’t been on training camp, I’d been training at home, and lots of time on the treadmill. So just trying to get things dialed in. And again, really happy with the performance atLavaredoand just over 12 minutes behind the King of Lavaredo,Hannes [Namberger], and you can’t, at that race, if anyone’s going to beat you, it’s-
iRunFar: It’s okay to be beaten by Hannes.
Evans: It’s okay to be beaten, you’re the next best person on that course. So yeah, I was really happy with that. And then I’ve gone straight from Lavaredo, I’ve only been home for six nights since Lavaredo, or spent a couple of weeks in Chamonix, and almost two months in [Les] Tines. Yeah, the last 12 weeks has been incredibly traditional ultrarunning, a hundred miles, goal being running around Mont Blanc.
iRunFar: Last year when we interviewed you before the race, you talked a lot about, you felt like one of your weaknesses was preparing to run through the night, and I think that’s where you had challenges ultimately. Looking back, now that you have the hindsight of one really great experience at UTMB, a less great one, and also your CCC experiences, what sort of hindsight vision are you bringing forward with you to Friday, Saturday?
Evans: I think at night, I guess that’s being ticked off, that’s the reason I raced Lavaredo.
iRunFar: Okay.
Evans: You get the perfect-
iRunFar: It’s a night race.
Evans: It’s a night race. You get to run. It was a 12-hour race, I started at 11:00 p.m.
iRunFar: You were destined to do that one, your body just decided that for you.
Evans: The race that I pulled out of, it was also a night race. There was logic in picking a race that started at night because I wanted a whole run through the night because I’m typically not that comfortable running at night. So there is method, again, we work back, what are the demands of the race? Running at night.
iRunFar: I got to figure out nighttime.
Evans: How do I figure that out? What’s the best lamp for me to use? Is the best lamp for me the best lamp for everyone else? Maybe, maybe not. And so yeah, I think that’s changed. And I think the big thing for me is patience. I’ve always liked rushing things, whether it’s at school or racing. I like front running. I think nowadays it’s … I couldn’t tell you the last time a man front run in any major race from the very, very beginning.
iRunFar: Who sticks it then?
Evans: Who sticks it? And I think especially a race like here, the last time here would’ve beenPau Capell, and that was an incredible race, and I think left everyone fairly speechless. And I’m not saying that I don’t think that can happen. I can’t do that. That’s not my style of racing. My style of racing is if I can control the first half, I’m then able to race the second half, rather than trying to race the second half, then I’m not able to control anything in the second half. Like I found out last year, and the pace was way too hot last year, and bothJim [Walmsley]andZach [Miller]had really, really low moments. They managed to pull it together, they managed to get through it, and ended up having incredible runs. But you compare, from last year,Germain [Grangier]’srun compared to Jim and Zach’s and…
iRunFar: Two different animals, wasn’t it?
Evans: Two completely different styles of racing. And so yeah, definitely the more conservative approach at the start, trying to be patient. And I think it’s going to be a fairly challenging year this year because it’s going to be hot, but I don’t think it’s going to be crazy hot, but it’s still going to be hot. It’s like a Western States and people say, “Oh, it’s not a hot year.” Yeah, it’s still…
iRunFar: 90-something degrees. Yeah.
Evans: It’s still going to be hot and it feels way hotter here. And especially the climb coming out of Courmayeur, it’s really hot, it’s really humid, it’s really sticky. And I think that will be a major part of the race, and somewhere where we’ve identified where it’s, yeah, have a few strategies for getting through that part. And yeah, I think just approaching it at way more of a, taking a step back and looking at everything from a hundred-mile perspective rather than looking at it as a… this is just an extension from a Western States.
iRunFar: Well, you nailed it when you said a few minutes ago that the race is not won in Vallorcine, the race is won at the finish line. And the patience thing is the reward, if you can do that.
Evans: For sure. But regardless whether it’s winning a race, the race finishes here, it’s not a 100k race, it’s not a hundred-mile race, it’s 107-mile race. You have to get here. And so, one of my big goals this year is finishing.
iRunFar: To get here.
Evans: To race sensibly. And if I really struggle and I end up hiking the last 15 hours, which I really hope I don’t, it’s my fault, and now you’ve got to live with the consequences. It’s so easy to pull out of races, and the more you pull out of races, the easier it then becomes. And I so nearly pulled out at Lavaredo because I’d gone through the night, that was the main, it was right, we think we’ve sorted out your nighttime, let’s go through it. So when it got to daylight, I was like, “Oh, I just pull out, it’ll be easy.”
iRunFar: Practice what I need to practice.
Evans: Yeah, exactly. I practiced what I need to practice and now it’s really easy. So yeah, the more you pull out, the easier it becomes. So I think for me, sticking in when it got really tough at Lavaredo, which it did, because I wasn’t prepared, this has now been a really nice full circle moment that now I feel incredibly calm and ready to give it a really good shot on Friday night.
iRunFar: Amazing. We look forward to seeing you do the full hundred miles, or 109 miles or whatever this is, and seeing you back in Chamonix.
Evans: Hopefully have a post-race interview.
iRunFar: There we go.
Evans: Thank you very much.

In this interview, he talks about life in both the U.S. and France, his approach to recovery and training betweenwinning the 2024Western States 100and returning to the 2024 UTMB, and his long-time ambition of completing both races in one season.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m withJim Walmsley.It’s a couple of days before the 2024UTMB.Here we are again, Jim.
Jim Walmsley:Yep. Welcome back to France. But I guess usually the past couple of years it would be welcome, but I just arrived about a month ago, so yeah. We’re both back in France, and doing it again.
iRunFar:It was just nine weeks ago that we saw you at the finish line ofWestern States.Talk us through the last nine weeks. You’ve had a lot going on. You’ve come to Silverton. You hung out in the San Juans in Colorado, and then you came back and re-assimilated to France.
Walmsley:Yeah, part of the idea was we wanted to step back, go back to Flagstaff, kind of reassess and absorb, like, France, our stay in France, our living in Arreche. Just kind of analyze more and more what we want to do, where we want to spend our time, kind of going forward and just be patient about an entire process. I think a lot of that goes to knowing we need to go back home to Flagstaff to kind of reflect.
With that, became, well, what’s the race season going to look like? And then that went to, well, I’d like to do an early season race, and then we’ll be at altitude. We’ll be back in Flag. Yeah, the opportunity to do Western States again comes up with that. And then obviously, I guess last year, even foresight of all of this happening in September. So having to qualify for Western States, and then talkingSimon Gosselininto qualifying as well. And then like, hey, Western States is a good idea, come to Flagstaff.
iRunFar:Just bringing your French friends to Flagstaff.
Walmsley:Yeah, exactly. So we had little France in Flagstaff for a while.
iRunFar:Little France. I love it.
Walmsley:Yeah, really good training process, I’d say. Like, caught a few months of being healthy, consistent, kind of vanilla, boring, rinse and repeat training.
iRunFar:As you want it to be.
Walmsley:Yeah, just about perfect, I guess, when you look at it that way. Where in years past, maybe I looked at perfect training as like, not only rinse and repeat and boring, but also big, fast, testing yourself, testing yourself with long runs, testing yourself with short runs.
iRunFar:Testing yourself a lot.
Walmsley:Yeah, and it just kind of goes to a bit tiring. And yeah, but then Western States ended up going really well. Things kind of checked out, but I think I didn’t end up racing earlier in the year. So in some ways, I felt like a lot of rust was busted on that race. And kind of the recovery from Western States was not ideal, and had a few injuries. Like, not injuries, but like things like hurting from the race just days after, and like, oh, I want to pay attention to this and that. But more or less just kind of had lingering inflammation that became a problem just to get back into things.
And yeah, so it’s been a big reminder in the last nine weeks of why Western States and UTMB, the two of them have always been a challenge for me. And why in 2021, I finally, I mean, essentially just mid-race, running out of energy, being over it, and saying, screw it. Like I’m going to go focus my time and energy at one race at a time, and step back from the race in 2021 and say, all right, I’m going to focus on this race in 2022, 2023. And we’ll see how that goes. So now, I guess I’m removed away from that enough to try it again, and quickly reminded that it’s not easy, it’s not perfect, and it is what it is, and it’s interesting.
Like it kind of almost makes me sad in some ways of the number of times I’ve put a foot forward coming right off of Western States, and not having just a reset build and a good foundation to go into such a race like UTMB. And against so many competitors, and like this is your representation in Europe, is this. Whereas, flip it the other way of like, yeah, we’ve seen lots of people struggle with coming right back from Western States, and it’s not uncommon. And yeah, I go through it, too.
iRunFar:It’s interesting for me to hear you sort of reflect back to, in the past, you tried to put two and two kind of opposites together, Western States and UTMB in one summer. And then you said, you know what, I’m going to focus on one, and then the other. But now it’s kind of coming full circle of like, okay, here’s the next challenge of can I put these two kind of different 100 milers together in a short period of time.
Walmsley:Yeah. Well, 2019, I didn’t run. I took the opportunity instead to trySierre-ZinalandUltravasankind of back-to-back, and that was its own interesting challenge. But that was one of the years thatFrançois [D’Haene],andKilian [Jornet],orXavier [Thévenard]didn’t win, one of those rare moments, and then you’re like, man, that could have been basically a missed opportunity of just not putting your name in the hat. And then even 2022, 2023, I’m not at Western States, and it’s just hard to choose one or the other. And then this year, it was just like, well, let’s do both. Like, I miss not being on the line for both, but then it’s just interesting trying the second one. And just sequentially in the calendar, UTMB second, depending how you look at it.
iRunFar:So, connect the dots a little bit, sort of recovery and training-wise over the last nine weeks between Western States and UTMB. A little bit of recovery. You said there were a few niggles to monitor, we know you were out training near where we live in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, and then you’ve been here for a month or so.
Walmsley:Yeah, so, I guess Western States kind of presented, and just being back in Flagstaff, and we’ve always gone out to Hardrock… people ask me about that race. And I’m like, well, I always have just been cheering here since 2015, and it’s like, I really enjoyed training here and cheering. And why do I want to change that routine? But this year was an opportunity to go camping in the San Juans and reflect again on the things we’re missing of our normal, or what became our normal routine for quite a few years in the U.S. And I hadn’t been back to Hardrock the last two years being in France, so, it was interesting.
It was nice, good. I mean, I really liked the disconnect going from Western States and then just out of cell service in Colorado. I liked that move, yeah. So, it was an opportunity just to kind of get back into trying our routine that we used to do. And now I get to kind of come here at the race and reflect on how that process has been, how it’s set me up, or even potentially held me back this year, or years past, and this or that. And I think it just kind of goes it’s probably not the ideal calendar or schedule of what you want to do in between the two races.
iRunFar:But it’s your schedule, right?
Walmsley:Yeah, I mean, I’m in control of it.
iRunFar:This is your deal.
Walmsley:But, I guess, like many of us, I’m a big fan, and, I love this sport, and I love running in the mountains. So, there’s the race side, but there’s also a human side where you need to fill up your own cup.
iRunFar:Exactly.
Walmsley:And, I take a lot away from being out in the mountains and disconnected from cell service and discovering new trails and stuff, so, yeah.
iRunFar:I guess that’s why, what I meant about that was that it feels like watching you, you have several different mountain homes or geographic homes at this point.
Walmsley:Yeah, yeah.
iRunFar:And it feels like you sort of have to check in with those just to get what you are needing out of your spaces.
Walmsley:Yeah, I mean we definitely missed the high altitude of Colorado. And even in general, here in France, we missed the lung-burning climbs. Instead, you replace it with just absolutely leg-burning climbs, and it’s just a bit different sensation, but it’s also interesting to reflect on how it’s affected racing. And more or less, I mean, when I was living full-time in Flagstaff, I think I have lots of friends that would probably attest that no way I was going to sleep at sea level. Like, no way. I’ll drive down to Phoenix and I’ll drive back up in the same day. Like, yeah, I’m not going to do it.
And now I’ve had to kind of accept not being “the high altitude athlete,” but it was also a big adjustment going back to Flagstaff and trying to sleep more normally back at home in Flagstaff, and it being different. And then also seeing results, be pretty good, and feel like I’m improving on climbing and steeper things while I’m here. It forces you to take a different perspective of well, why is it working then? Is it needed? Is this that? What are the factors that are making for the improvements?
iRunFar:And probably those factors are shifting because, like, your career continues to evolve, and you’re putting more miles in the bank, and more miles in all these different types of terrain, and your body is just uptaking all this stuff a little bit differently, isn’t it?
Walmsley:Yeah. I think for this double I’ve thought a lot about, yes, obviouslyCourtney [Dauwalter]‘s done some good doubles. But then even I live very close toRob Krarin Flagstaff, and I’ve had a few conversations with him and him discussing the year he did Western States,Leadville, Run Rabbit, one of the best triples ever done.
iRunFar:Ooh, good point and good memory there, I like that.
Walmsley:But I remember discussing with him and just the lack of anything he did in between the races. Oh, interesting. And just kind of drawing on it’s okay to rest right now in between the races.
iRunFar:Interesting.
Walmsley:And kind of drawing on it’s okay to rest right now, in between the two races. Although it’s nine weeks, so maybe it stretches what either of them kind of did, the gap between the two. I just know in years past I’ve always done a little bit too much, and felt fatigued, so, yeah. If anything, it has been different.
Each ultra ends up kind of being unique and so, yeah, the cards that I have in my hand this year are different, but also I wouldn’t be lining up if I didn’t think I had a chance to compete up front and compete and even then now looking at things I’ve never done. I haven’t finished both races, so that’s one of those, you can go down the checklist of what you want to do here, and it kind of falls to that. I’ve tried it many times, and I still haven’t done both, or finished both. So, even that one’s still on the board to get some positive points.
iRunFar:I feel like you’ve been at this race many times. You’ve had various levels of success. You had, of course, your best success last year, winning, setting a course record despite it being a very evolving course. You must have a different perspective on your approach to it this year, because you’ve already met that high-level goal you had for yourself last year. Where has your mindset been in the motivation, the drive to come and do this again?
Walmsley:Well, I think after last year there were a lot of questions of what do you do next and this and that. And I think when you have the opportunity to be on top of the sport for even a glimpse of a moment, like, the more I reflected on that of, like, well, that doesn’t last long. You don’t know how long. And, the reflection kind of went, well, I got to try to compete to stay at the top. So then it turned into, well, yeah, like when people are in a sport and they win a championship, what do they want to do the next season? Like, you finally won the championship. And, well, let’s build to try to do it again.
And so that kind of became the theme and goal, but at the same time now going through the process, and doing the two races, or not yet, but doing Western States and coming off the recovery and, ups and downs with that, kind of goes to it’s not the build from last year. I need to accept with, like, where I’m at. I don’t have a fully focused training block towards UTMB this year. So it’s a different hand I have this year.
iRunFar:It’s interesting to hear you say that because you said the same thing for Western States, that your build for that one was evolved compared to your prior Westerns from just a few limitations going on. So lots of things work for you.
Walmsley:Yeah, I mean, even lots of things popped up this winter, and I think that kind of goes to figuring out how you can train with what’s going on. Little injuries, little niggles. Where you are, whether you’re taking vacation, whether you’re in San Juans, whether you’re at the beach. Making the most of what you’re able to train with, and just being effective with that scenario. So, and then just listening to how to best set you up to try to show up healthy and give yourself a chance. Because if you’re on the line, that’s where it all starts, so you got to get there first.
iRunFar:Last question for you. For me, watching you be here over the years, people’s relationship with you have evolved, right? Like, maybe there was this air of American skepticism, but now I feel like there are multiple countries, and multiple communities who sort of claim you and get behind you and sort of boost you. That change, like, I see it, I feel it. Do you feel it? And what is it like for you?
Walmsley:Yeah, I don’t know. I mean, it’s interesting. I think UTMB, at least living in France, people here were absolutely stoked for me, and that means a lot. And then, I mean, it was months before I went back to the U.S., and then it was like I went back to the U.S. and I just had people, just like, it is home in Flagstaff and like, it is nice. And yeah, it’s interesting. I’m just really fortunate to build communities and have people cheer for me, and yeah. I feel like all I can do back is just give my best foot forward, try my hardest, and keep working hard. And people latch onto that and we can all relate with hard work. And that’s kind of what we can control in some ways so.
And even just, maybe that’s just the American ethos in some ways of we have some power to try a little harder, which is sometimes good and bad. I think when I reflect on being in Europe and then looking at more U.S. stuff going on it’s like, well, maybe it would be better to take a step back. Or to do a little different terrain, or a different sport, and this and that. And earlier in my career coming more from just a runner/track background, this and that, and it’s like no.
Like East Africans, they run year-round. They don’t do skiing. Like, no way. And then traditionally 90s running in the U.S., this and that, like speed workouts. And then look at 70s, volume based. We’re back to a little bit of volume base, this is that. And yeah, I don’t know. It kind of just goes to there’s many different ways to prepare, and each way doesn’t even have to be the same for one athlete year to year. So I think I’m learning that, and it makes it more interesting and stuff. But yeah, it’s been interesting.
iRunFar:Well, best of luck to you. I think there is no doubt to any of us that you will be putting your best foot forward. That’s what Jim Walmsley does, so best of luck to you and doing that this weekend.
Walmsley:Thanks so much. Yeah, good to see you here again, and looking forward to everybody out on the course. Yeah, it’ll be crazy, just like every year.
iRunFar:It will be crazy.

2024 TDS Results: Dohin and Marquet Win for France,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-tds-results,"Here we go! The weeklong group ofUTMBraces in Chamonix, France, is certainly the year’s biggest week of ultrarunning, and one of the first races is the 148-kilometerTDS.
An acronym for Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie, the TDS race left Courmayeur, Italy, with nearly 1,600 runners just before midnight local time on Monday, August 26, 2024, and gathered about 9,300 meters of elevation on its way to Chamonix. That’s about 92 miles and 30,500 feet of elevation gain. TDS is considered more technical than either of the longer UTMB orCCCraces and is on more remote trails.
You can also check out more results from the week’s UTMB Mont Blanc festival:
Ariane Wilhem(Switzerland) ran the downhill six miles from miles 51 to 57 seven minutes faster than then-leaderEmilie Collomb(Italy) to temporarily take the lead, but further backMarie Dohin(France) was full of run.
Dohin climbed past Wilhem and into the lead heading up to Barrage de la Girotte at mile 66. Ten miles later, Dohin held a nine-minute lead over Wilhem, and the pair further separated from each other the rest of the way. Dohin, who was fifth at this race in 2021, was the race winner in 24:06, and Wilhem held onto a second-place finish in 24:42.

Despite a shorter course than last year’s rerouted race and with better weather this year, the winning time was around 30 minutes slower than in 2023.
Céline Finaswas third in 25:41.
French women took six of the top 10 finish positions.
Full results.
Ariane Wilhem, the 2024 TDS second-place woman.
Thibault Marquet(France) hit the top of the Passeur Pralognan at mile 38 in a lead group alongsideAleksei Beresnev(competing as a neutral athlete) andAleix Toda Mas(Spain) and quickly separated from them over the next two downhill miles. Beresnev would fall way back, and Toda Mas would end up not finishing. Marquet led the race the rest of the way, and at the end, he was well clear of second place.
Marquet dipped under the 19-hour mark with an 18:59:36 finish, running 37 minutes quicker thanChristian Meierdid when he won the 2023 race on a longer course and in snow.
Marquet was 12th on the full UTMB course in 2022.
Thibault Marquet, the 2024 TDS men’s winner.
No one had a stronger second half than runner-upAlban Berson(France). Just inside the top 20 early on, Berson was still only in eighth at mile 45. He moved up quickly and held that second-place spot from mile 66 through the finish in 19:56:40. Berson raced UTMB in 2022, also finishing one spot behind Marquet in 13th.
Alban Berson, the 2024 TDS second-place man.
Gautier Airiau(France) overtook a fadingSimon Gosselin(France) with about 10 miles to go to move into third. Airiau finished in 20:07, and Gosselin did not finish. Airiau had a similar second-half charge to Berson.
All of the top five finishers were French.

Hannes Namberger Pre-2024 UTMB Interview,https://www.irunfar.com/hannes-namberger-pre-2024-utmb-interview,"Hannes Nambergerof Germany is back for his fourth start atUTMB, having finished eighth in 2023 and sixth in 2021. In the following interview, Hannes talks about how becoming a dad has changed his outlook on racing, his past year which included a win at the 2024Lavaredo Ultra Trail, and what he hopes to get out of this year’s UTMB experience.
For more on who’s racing, check out our in-depthmen’sandwomen’spreviews and follow ourlive race coveragestarting Friday.
﻿
iRunFar:Sarah Brady of iRunFar. I’m here just before the 2024 UTMB with Hannes Namberger. Hannes, how are you doing?
Hannes Namberger:I’m fine, thank you.
iRunFar:Great. Welcome back to Chamonix. When did you get here?
Namberger:I arrived yesterday not too early and that’s always perfect for me to have some days here and then we can go directly into the race.
iRunFar:You know this route pretty well. So I guess you don’t really need to go out and recce again.
Namberger:I planned it, but it was not possible. When I wanted to do it, my body was not working really well, but it’s part of the game. But I did it three times now and it should be enough.
iRunFar:That should be enough. Yeah. So I believe you had some sort of Achilles pain a few weeks ago. Is that all put to bed now?
Namberger:Yeah, everything. It was not directly Achilles, it was locking the foot and the knee and that makes some. Body is something really strange. And then Achilles was hurting, then we unlocked it and everything was nearly okay.
iRunFar:Nearly okay is as good as it gets in the sport, I think. So you became a dad since I’ve last seen you. Congratulations.
Namberger:Yeah. Thank you very much.
iRunFar:So how has that changed your training and your racing?
Namberger:Yes. I would say it’s more relaxed, but that’s not the right word. Focus is not always about running. It’s more about my son and the family and running is always a big part. But yeah, you have to save your energy also for the family and not always thinking about yourself.
iRunFar:So it’s less pressure in a way that it’s not the only thing?
Namberger:Yeah. And it also gives you a lot of motivation. For example, I’m dreaming about to make it to the finish line and my son is waiting there and that’s for me the best thing ever.
iRunFar:That would be fab. So this is your fourth time starting UTMB. So you’ve had some really good results here. You were at sixth in ’21, you’re eighth last year, but an hour faster and then you had a DNF in between. So what do you think is kind of possible for your best day here?
Namberger:My plan is to stay at my program, what I have to do to do my exercises perfectly, to eat enough, stay warm, full focus, not thinking about time or splits or something. I have to do a race. I want to race, I want to do a race and that’s my plan. And also to enjoy it, to be here, to be healthy, to enjoy this atmosphere, like the first time when you’re here. Yeah, when you do your first race here. And that’s my main goal for ’24.
iRunFar:Okay, great. And then you’ve had a good year so far. So you had a really good win at Lavaredo and I saw it was quite close. You were just two and a half minutes ahead ofTom Evans. So how did that go?
Namberger:The year was not always perfect, a lot of things around or next to the sport like work and we tried to run away the house and that was at the beginning of the year, not easy, but then we changed a little bit and Lavaredo went perfect. And then I was knowing, “Okay, I have the skills to win races.” To be also successful here in UTMB is super difficult, but I try to do my best and we’ll see what happened on Saturday.
iRunFar:And you said when we were chatting just off camera, that they’re quite close together at Lavaredo and UTMB and to do both of them well is difficult. So how have you managed to balance recovery after that race with training and building up again?
Namberger:To do a normal training. To do nothing special. Nothing too crazy. Things what you always do. Normal training, not too much volume. That’s my medicine and do what I always do and maybe it works or not.
iRunFar:Yeah, we’ll find out soon. And then there’s a lot of men on the start list who you’ve run with before. So obviously you’re pretty close to Tom a few weeks ago at Lavaredo, he’s back here. And thenDimitri [Mityaev], who you shared a win with before. And Ultra-Trail Cape Town is running as well. So is there anyone else you’d like to share some miles with this weekend?
Namberger:I don’t think it’s important to share some miles. Only if you have the same performance then you can help each other. But the fastest way is always to go your own pace and don’t wait or to run over your limit. So I will stick to my plan, have a good race, eat enough, stay warm, run smooth, and yeah, don’t do stupid things.
iRunFar:And is there any particular part of the course that you’re excited to get to again, besides the finish line?
Namberger:Yeah, the last three hills of the Champex-Lac, they are super special because the people there are waiting for you. If we have good weather, then it’s like to the frost, they’re cheering for you. You cannot walk, you have to run. They push you to a higher limit and your body is totally wasted, but they push you forward. And I love this feeling. It’s not only for the elite runners, I hope for everybody. And then if you make it to the finish line, that’s the best feeling ever.
iRunFar:Of course.
Namberger:That gives you a lot of energy back and then hopefully the family’s waiting and we can celebrate it.
iRunFar:Okay, very good. And then it’s probably too soon, but do you have plans for the rest of the year after this?
Namberger:Directly into holiday.
iRunFar:Very good.
Namberger:And to the beach.
iRunFar:Brilliant.
Namberger:And then Cape Town again.
iRunFar:Okay, very good.
Namberger:It’s for me, one of the best places to do beach holiday or beach things, spend holiday and to run. And yeah, I love Cape Town.
iRunFar:Okay, and you’ve had some very good runs there?
Namberger:Yes.
iRunFar:Okay, great. Well, I hope you have a fantastic run this weekend.
Namberger:Thank you very much.
iRunFar:I look forward to seeing you out there. Thanks very much.
Namberger:Thanks.

2024 UTMB Women’s Preview,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-utmb-womens-preview,"At 6 p.m. on August 30, more than 2,500 runners will take to the streets of Chamonix, France, to begin their 176-kilometer (109-mile) loop around Mont Blanc, otherwise known as the 2024UTMB.
Many of the top women have already finished a major 100-mile event this year, with the top four women from the 2024 Western States 100 lining up for UTMB —Katie Schide,Fu-Zhao Xiang,Eszter Csillag, andEmily Hawgood. Joining these four are a cadre of women with a history of running UTMB quickly —Marianne Hogan,Blandine L’Hirondel, andMaite Maiora— all of whom have finished in the top five of UTMB in the past two years.
Joining these women are a whole host of others who have proven their speed on mountainous courses but have never run UTMB before, such asRuth Croft, and those, likeManon Bohard Cailler, who haven’t managed to put together a solid lap of Mont Blanc yet, but have shown the potential to run near the front of the field.
And with defending champion and course-record holderCourtney Dauwalterand last year’s second-place finisherKatharina Hartmuthnot on the start line this year, it seems like it’s anyone’s race to win. The depth of talent in this year’s women’s field is sure to create exciting racing.
For those not familiar with the race, UTMB roughly follows the Tour du Mont Blanc route around the iconic European mountain, starting in Chamonix, France, and visiting Italy and Switzerland before returning to Chamonix. Over the course of the 176k race, runners cover nearly 10,000 meters (32,700 feet) of elevation gain, see some incredible Alps scenery, and experience some of the most enthusiastic support in the ultrarunning world.

Katie Schide
Katie Schide(pre-race interview), an American living in France and former UTMB champion, is a late entry to this year’s race, and one could argue a favorite to win the event. After adominant win at the 2024 Western States 100, where she finishedsecond in 2023, Schide now lines up for a completely different style of racing from the net-downhill and hot and dusty trails of California that she excelled on just a few months ago. Schide is no stranger to UTMB, having finished it three times, with awin in 2022and asixth-place finish in 2019. In addition to her win at the Western States 100, Schide also won the Canyons 100k earlier in 2024. Her 2023 results include a win at Diagonale des Fous and a second-place finish at OCC. The big question will be whether she’s had enough time to recover from her massive Western States 100 effort at the end of June.
Blandine L’Hirondelof France may be considered the host country’s favorite this year after finishingthird at UTMB in 2023. She is the highest placed finisher from 2023 who is returning this year. Unlike many other women lining up, she’s focused on 50k and shorter events this year, including the Marathon du Mont Blanc 20k and the European Off-Road Championships 58k. She’s no stranger to the UTMB events, winning the 2022 CCC and 2021 OCC, setting course records at both events. In 2023, she placed fifth at the Zegama Marathon, and in 2022, shewon the Trail World Championship Long Trail.
Ruth Croft
New Zealand’sRuth Croft(pre-race interview) was set to race her first UTMB last year but was forced to withdraw before the start due to illness. Croft has been on a roll in the past eight months, winning the 2023 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k, 2024 Tarawera Ultramarathon 100k, and 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon. These results indicate that the Kiwi is on form for her debut UTMB. She’s no stranger to racing in the area and won OCC in both 2018 and 2019. She alsowon the Western States 100 in 2022andplaced second in 2021. Her results also include awin at the 2021 Les Templiers.
One should never count outMarianne Hogan(pre-race interview) of Canada when it comes to UTMB. Shefinished second in 2022in her debut at the event. Earlier this year, she won the Swiss Canyon Trail 100k and placed sixth at Transvulcania. As with many other women in this field, she’s had a strong showing at the Western States 100 in the past, with athird place in 2022. In 2023, she finished second at the Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k.
Fu-Zhao Xiang
Lining up for her fifth UTMB, China’sFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-race interview) has plenty of experience and course knowledge to rely on. She’s also part of the women’s contingent aiming for the Western States 100-UTMB double, coming off of astrong second place at the California event. Xiang is the picture of consistency and has come away with wins at the Mount Yun 50k and The North Face 100 Ultra Trail Challenge Moganshan 30k already this year. As for her UTMB finishes, she placed fourth, seventh, 11th, and 20th in 2023, 2022, 2019, and 2018, respectively. She was also fifth at the Tarawera 100k and won the Doi Inthanon 50k and Translantau 130k in 2023. In 2020, shefinished second at Transgrancanaria.
Eszter Csillag(pre-race interview) is also looking to double up with the Western States 100 and UTMB. The Hungarian runner, now living in Hong Kong, is coming off astrong third place at the 2024 Western States 100and is looking to improve on herfifth place at the 2022 UTMB. In 2023, she had a disappointing UTMB with a DNF and is surely bringing lessons from that experience to the start line this year. Csillag was alsothird at the 2023 Western States 100, and won the Translantau the same year. She was fourth at 2021 CCC.
Maite Maiora
Spain’sMaite Maiora(pre-race interview) is lining up with the experience that comes from athird-place finish at UTMB in 2019and a fifth-place finish in 2023. While 2021 saw her DNF the race, she’s sure to use the knowledge gained from two prior laps around the mountain for this go-around. Thus far in 2024, she’s finished third at both Val d’Aran 100k and Madeira Island Ultra-Trail (MIUT), results that follow up a strong 2023 season that included a win at the Trail Alsace Grand Est 100 Mile and fourth places at Val d’Aran 100k, Istria 100k, and Transgrancanaria 50k.
Known for her ever-present smile,Emily Hawgoodis back at UTMB after finishing second at CCC in 2023. The Zimbabwean living in the U.S. is fresh off a fourth-place finish at the Western States 100 earlier this year and a win at the Chianti Ultra Trail 74k. She’s finished UTMB twice before, in sixth and 10th in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Her Western States 100 finish this year is on the tail of two fifth-place finishes at the event in 2022 and 2023, and a seventh in 2021.
Sabrina Stanley
Sabrina Stanleyof the U.S. finished 9th in the 2023 UTMB after not starting the 2022 edition due to a COVID-19 infection. The two-time Hardrock 100 winner, both in 2021 and 2018, is clearly comfortable on mountainous 100-mile courses and is surely looking to improve on last year’s result. While she’s raced more locally in 2024, including winning the Silverton Alpine Marathon 50k, she has a whole host of high results in Europe, including a second place at the 2023 Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100 Mile, a fourth in the 2021 MIUT, and a win at the 2019 Diagonale des Fous.

Manon Bohard Cailler
Manon Bohard Caillerhas DNFed her past two attempts at UTMB in 2023 and 2022, but that doesn’t mean she should be counted out for the 2024 edition. The Frenchwoman won TDS in 2021 and placedthird at the Trail World Championships Long Trail in 2023. That year, she also won MIUT by a 52-minute margin in a dominant performance. In June of 2024, she placed second at the Swiss Canyon Trail 100k.
Ragna Debats, who is Dutch but lives in Spain, had a string of strong results to close out her 2023 season and start 2024. She placed second at the Javelina 100 Mile and Doi Inthanon 100k at the tail end of 2023 before placing second at the Desafio en las Nubes 50k and fourth at the Tenerife Bluetrail 72k in 2024. In prior years, she won the 2022 Transgrancanaria andplaced third at the 2021 Western States 100. She also won CCC in 2019. However, she has recently been diagnosed with IMO (intestinal methane overgrowth,) which she talks about on her social media. She ran and finished the 2024 Western States 100 post-diagnosis, but not competitively, and it remains to be seen if she will run UTMB. We wish her all the best for a return to full health.
Anne-Lise Rousset Séguret
Anne-Lise Rousset Séguretstarted out her 2024 season with a pair of second-place finishes at MIUT and High Trail Vanoise 20k. The Frenchwoman had a successful 2023 with asecond place at the Hardrock 100and a win at the Wildstrubel 70k. In 2022, she placed second at Diagonale des Fous and was fourth at the 2018 CCC.
Martina Valmassoiof Italy didn’t finish UTMB in 2023, her first attempt at 100 miles, but she had a strong win at TDS in 2022, which indicates her ability to do well in this race. Earlier in 2023, she placed fourth at the Trail World Championships Long Trail and won Transvulcania. To start off 2024, she won MIUT.
Hillary Allen
Known more for her prowess at the shorter and more technical races,Hillary Allenof the U.S. returns to UTMB to try to improve upon her 14th-place finish in 2022. In 2019, she placed second at TDS and won the Lavaredo Ultra Trail 50k. Then, in 2021, shewon MIUT. Since then, she’s placed second at the 2022 Speedgoat 50k and won the 2022 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100 Mile.
Claire Bannwarth
France’sClaire Bannwarthis known for her ability to run incredibly long distances and is surely looking to improve upon her 16th and 21st placings at UTMB in 2023 and 2022, respectively. When it comes to longer distances, there aren’t many better than her, and she’s raced more miles in 2024 than the other women in the field, winning the 400k Montreux Trail Festival, the 185k Trail Menorca Camí de Cavalls, and the Lake Zurich 100k. She also placed fourth at MIUT, second at the Tahoe 200 Mile, and eighth at the Hardrock 100. And those races were after winning the 420k Winter Spine Race to start out 2024.
Abby Hallof the U.S. is lining up for her first UTMB after three finishes of CCC, including placing third in 2022 and second in 2021. She was second at the 2022 Transgrancanaria and sixth at the 2023 MIUT.
Ekaterina Mityaeva
Ekaterina Mityaevais racing as a neutral athlete in this year’s UTMB and is coming to the event after a win at the Mont Blanc 90k, an improvement over her fourth-place finish at the event in 2023. She also placed third at the Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k in 2023. Mityaeva is no stranger to racing in the Mont Blanc area, with fourth-place finishes at the 2019 UTMB and 2021 TDS. She alsoplaced third at the 2021 MIUT.
After finishing second at the 2023 TDS, France’sFiona Portereturns to Chamonix for her debut UTMB. Her successful 2023 season also included a win at Lavaredo and a win at the Maxi-Race Annecy, where she placed second in 2024. In 2022, she placed third at Les Templiers.
Aroa Sío
Aroa Síoof Spain returns to UTMB after an eighth-place finish in 2022 and a DNF in 2023. She started her 2023 season with a pair of third-place finishes at the Canyons 100k and Tarawera 100k. This year, she’s started the season with fifth place at MIUT.
Before placing sixth at UTMB in 2023,Katarzyna Solińskaof Poland may have been known as a shorter-distance specialist. She’d placed 18th in her debut UTMB in 2022, which was also her first 100-mile race, after placing second at Lavaredo earlier in the year. She was also fifth at CCC in 2021. Earlier this year, she won the Trail Verbier St Bernard, a repeat of her performance from 2023.
Lucy Bartholomew
Lucy Bartholomewof Australia has expanded her focus from just running in recent years, but that doesn’t mean that she can’t put together a strong performance around Mont Blanc. In 2023, she placed 10th at the event in addition to winning the Bandera 50k and Tarawera 100 Mile. That year, she also placed second at the Ultra-Trail Australia, a result that she repeated in 2024.
WhileClaudia Trempsof Spain may have had a DNF at the 2023 UTMB, she’s had a good start to her 2024 season that could point toward the potential of a strong performance this time around. Just this year, she’s placed second at Transgrancanaria, Istria 42k, and Trail Andorra 100k. In 2022, she placed second at TDS, and the year prior, in 2021, she was ninth at UTMB.
Claire Heslopof Canada finished 11th at the 2023 UTMB, a significant jump up in the placings from her 18th and 19th place finishes in the event in 2021 and 2022, respectively. This year she’s showing strong form with a third place at the Tenerife Bluetrail 110k and a 10th place at the Hardrock 100.
Kimino Miyazaki
Japan’sKimino Miyazakiis no stranger to the UTMB course, having placed 15th in 2023 after a 24th-place finish in 2022. She had a strong 2023 season with a win at the Istria 100 Mile and a second place at the Tarawera 100 Mile. She was also eighth at the Doi Inthanon 100 Mile in 2022. While her 2024 season hasn’t started off quite as strong, she placed second at the Restonica Trail 110k in July, showing that the form is there.
Emily Vaudanof Switzerland finished 13th in UTMB in 2023 and 12th in 2022 after a DNF at her debut at the event in 2021. Her consistency and commitment to the event point toward a potential top-10 finish this time around. In 2022, she won the Trail Verbier St Bernard 110k and was third in the 2020 Swiss Peaks Trail 315k, showing that she’s comfortable with the 100-mile distance. She started off her 2024 season with a 16th at Transgrancanaria.

Marta Molist
Marta Molistof Spain had breakout seasons in 2021 and 2022, winning several high-profile events, including the 2021 CCC, 2021 Tenerife Bluetrail 70k, 2022 Swiss Alps 50k, and 2022 Mozart 75k. Her 2023 season and start of 2024 have been relatively quiet, but a win at the 2023 Ultra Pirineu 100k shows she is back in good form.
After finishing sixth at the 2021 UTMB,Maryline Nakacheof France came back to Chamonix to win TDS in 2023. That same year, she placed second at Lavaredo. To start off 2024, she placed a strong third in the Mozart 100k and won the Trail Nivolet-Revard 58k and the Trail Sainte-Victoire-Le Cézanne 40k.
This will be AmericanHelen Mino Faukner’sfirst run at UTMB after two finishes at CCC, where she placed third in 2023 and 13th in 2022. She’s better known for her speed over shorter distances, with wins at the 2023 Speedgoat 50k and Kodiak Ultra Marathon 21k, and a win at the 2024 Desert Rats 50k.
Relatively new to ultrarunning,Mari Klakegg Fenreof Norway had a strong 2023 season, finishing seventh at CCC and eighth at the Trail World Championships Long Trail. Her fourth place at Val d’Aran 50k earlier this year, as well as her win at the Skogvokteren Ultra 90k, indicate she’s on form.
Núria Picas
Núria Picasof Spain first raced UTMB in2013 and placed second. She was alsosecond in 2014andwon the race in 2017. She returns to the event after finishing third at Val d’Aran 110k in 2023, as well as winning the Ultra Pirineu 100k in 2022.
WhileEmma Stuartof Ireland, who lives in the U.K., is relatively new to ultrarunning and will be new to UTMB, she’s found plenty of success in the 100-mile distance in her relatively short time with the sport. In 2023, in what seems like only her third year of racing ultra distances, she won the Tor des Géants, Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100 Mile, and the Arc of Attrition 100 Mile and placed third at Lavaredo.

2024 UTMB Men’s Preview,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-utmb-mens-preview,"Another trip around the sun is complete, andUTMBis back! At 6 p.m. local time (CEST) on August 30, 2024, some 2,500 hopefuls will begin their circuit of Mont Blanc from Chamonix, France. They will have 46.5 hours to make it back to Chamonix, but some will need less than half that. Below, we have detailed who will most likely be the fastest men taking on the big loop.
Returning championJim Walmsley(U.S.) is hard to argue against as the favorite. It took him a few years to crack UTMB, but when he did, he did so in spectacular fashion, winning last year’s race in a course-record time of 19:37. Also in contention are recent podium finishersMathieu Blanchard(France),Germain Grangier(France), andTom Evans(U.K.). Each of these men will be hoping to climb a step or two higher on the podium this year. Also in the mix is recent Hardrock 100 winnerLudovic Pommeret(France).
For those who are new here, UTMB roughly follows the iconic Tour de Mont Blanc trail — a 176-kilometer (more than 109-mile) loop covering nearly 10,000 meters (32,700 feet) of elevation gain and taking in three countries — France, Italy, and Switzerland. It is seen by many as the pinnacle event in trail running, a bucket list race for recreational ultrarunners, and the ultimate showdown for elites.
A special thanks toHOKAfor making our coverage of UTMB possible!
Tune in to our UTMB live race coverage starting at 6 p.m. CEST (10 a.m. MDT in the U.S.) on Friday, August 30, right here on iRunFar. Stay tuned!

Jim Walmsley
Ultrarunning fans everywhere will delight at seeingreigning UTMB men’s championJim Walmsley(pre-race interview) back on the start list for 2024. Having recentlywon the 2024 Western States 100, his fourth win at the revered 100 miler where he holds the course record, the American looks like a strong contender to be the first man in 13 years to win both Western States and UTMB in one season. From what we can tell, Walmsley has won almost every ultra he’s started since 2021, with the only exception being the 2022 UTMB, where he placed fourth and the 2021 UTMB, which he didn’t finish. Having spent two years living in France to specify his training for the UTMB course, we think it’s highly likely he could double down on last year’s win and produce another showstopper.
FrenchmanMathieu Blanchardput on a spectacular display at the 2022 UTMB when he challenged Kilian Jornet to a duel,eventually placing secondafter running neck-and-neck until late in the race. His 2023 season — although solid, with a sixth-place finish at Western States 100 and fourth at UTMB — didn’t quite live up to the expectations set by that 2022 UTMB run. He has, however, been running well in 2024, with a win at the 94k Maxi-Race Annecy in June. If he can replicate some of what we saw in 2022, he won’t be far off the front.
Germain Grangier
France’sGermain Grangier(pre-race interview) outdid himself at the2023 UTMB, where he placed third, applying pressure to top two — Jim Walmsley and Zach Miller — the whole way to the finish. He did that after an impressive win at the 2023 Mont Blanc Marathon 90k. Grangier also placed fifth and ninth, respectively, at the 2021 and 2019 UTMB races and has shown himself to be on an upward curve.
Having placed third at the 2022 UTMB, while still making his comeback following knee surgery, and going on towin the 2023 Western States 100, the U.K.’sTom Evans(pre-race interview) was one of the favorites to win the 2023 UTMB. It wasn’t to be, though, and he was forced to withdraw at the halfway mark with stomach issues. Evans, who won CCC in 2018, has been sharpening up this year byracing cross countryat home in England. Thus far in 2024, he’s placed third in the Transvulcania Ultramarathon and second at the Lavaredo Ultra Trail.
Hannes Namberger
Germany’sHannes Namberger(pre-race interview) has had two top-10 finishes at UTMB — sixth in 2021 and eighth in 2023 — with a DNF sandwiched in the middle. He had a few below-par races in 2023 mixed in with a win at the Eiger Ultra Trail 100k, and has shown himself to be back on form this year — logging his third win at Lavaredo, ahead of Tom Evans, and just a minute over his 2022 course record. He alsowon the 2021 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail.
FrenchmanAurélien Dunand-Pallaz(pre-race interview) has been crushing 100 milers over the past few years and should be in the tussle for a podium spot at this year’s UTMB. While he didn’t finish the 2022 UTMB, he placedsecond in 2021, having won that year’s Transgrancanaria, and thenwon both Hardrock 100and Diagonale des Fous in a brilliant 2023 season. His best run this year so far was third at the 94k Maxi-Race Annecy, behind Mathieu Blanchard and Thibaut Garrivier, and he finished 12th at the Mont Blanc 90k, but past performances would suggest he is better suited to the 100-mile distance.
Ludovic Pommeret
Ludovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) of France dazzled at the2024 Hardrock 100, where he won by more than three hours, setting an overall men’s course record. It was his first time racing the route, but his fourth time running on it, as he paced compatriot Aurélien Dunand-Pallaz to victory in the 2023 event and ran the course twice ahead of race day. The 49-year-old Pommeret has a depth of experience on the UTMB course with three top-10 finishes, including fifth last year and awin in 2016. He also won the 2022 TDS, the 2021 Diagonale des Fous, and placed sixth at the 2022 Western States 100. It’s a tight turnaround from Hardrock to UTMB, but assuming he is sufficiently recovered, he should be in contention for a top spot.

Dmitry Mityaev
Dmitry Mityaevhas been running well in ultras for a number of years and seems to be on an upward trajectory lately. He won the 2024 Mont Blanc 90k, up from fourth in 2023, and taking 19 minutes off his time. In one of trail running’s aww moments, he shared the celebrations with his wife, Ekaterina Mityaeva, who won the women’s race. Also in 2024, Mityaev placed second at Transvulcania. He won the 2023 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k, having shared the win with Hannes Namberger at the 2022 event. In 2021, heplaced second at the Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT). He also placed second in TDS in 2019 but failed to finish UTMB on his first attempt in 2021.
France’sThibaut Garrivierplaced sixth in the 2023 UTMB after a strong fourth-place finish at the 2023 Trail World Championships Long Trail and a win at MIUT 85k. His form has been solid this year, with a second-place finish behind Mathieu Blanchard at Maxi-Race Annecy and a fifth-place finish at Lavaredo, and he should be in contention for another top-10 placing at UTMB this year.
Drew Holmen
It appears thatDrew Holmenof the U.S. has only done two 100 milers to date, but he’s made them count,finishing thirdand fifth in the 2021 and 2022 Western States 100, respectively. In 2023, he won the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile and took fifth in both CCC and the Trail World Championships Long Trail in the Austrian Alps. All that suggests a more mountainous 100 miler won’t be a problem for him, and he could easily run into a top-10 spot or better.
Thibaut Baronianmakes his 100-mile debut at the 2024 UTMB, but the Frenchman can’t be discounted for that reason. He comes with years of experience competing at the highest level over shorter distances and placed third in the 2021 CCC, which was his first 100k. Prior to that, he placed second at the 2017 OCC and third in 2016. He also placed fourth in the 2023 Trail World Championships Short Trail. More recently, he took second in the 2024 Mont Blanc 90k.
Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon
FrenchmanArthur Joyeux-Bouillontook ninth at the 2023 UTMB, running just four minutes quicker than his seventh-place finish in 2022 — albeit on a slightly altered course. His UTMB-specific resume also includes a ninth-place finish in CCC in 2018, and third in TDS in 2021. Arguably, the best runs of his career have been at these events. So far this year, he’s placed ninth at Lavaredo amongst a competitive field, and he should be in with a good shot at another UTMB top-10 placing.
Jia-Sheng Shenof China is one of ultrarunning’s rising stars. He earned a name for himself bywinning the Hong Kong 100k in 2019at the tender age of 23. Since then, he’s won over a range of distances at home in China, including The North Face 100 Challenge Moganshan 100k in 2021. He’s had two top-10 finishes at the Western States 100 — fourth in 2023 and eighth in 2024. Last year, he took second at CCC, only losing contact with the winner on the final climb. His form suggests that stepping up to the full loop will be no trouble to him, and he should be a contender for a high placing.
Miguel Heras
Miguel Herastook second in a top field at the 2024 Transgrancanaria, less than a half hour slower than his winning time from the same race 14 years prior (although the course has changed repeatedly), and in more challenging conditions. The 49-year-old Spaniard has a depth of experience in ultra racing. He tends to favor racing at home in Spain and has won the prestigious Ultra Pirineu 100k twice — in 2016 and 2022 — and podiumed there in 2015 and 2023 also. Outside of Spain, wins include the 2016 Les Templiers.He placed second in UTMB back in 2013, and since that has failed to finish on two further attempts — in 2017 and 2023.
Jonas Russiof Switzerland took eighth in the 2022 UTMB but failed to finish upon return the following year. The 2023 Lavaredo winner DNFed the Trail Alsace Grand Est 100 Mile in May of this year, which he put down to an injury sustained in training. He must have shaken it off quickly enough, as he was back the following month with a strong fourth-place run at Lavaredo and was not far off his winning time from 2023. If his luck is in, he could be in the mix for another top-ten finish at UTMB.
Beñat Marmissolle
France’sBeñat Marmissolletook sixth at the 2022 UTMB and went on toplace second behind Aurélien Dunand-Pallaz at the 2023 Hardrock 100. While he’s raced a range of distances, his best results seem to be at events over 100 miles, with a win at the 2022 Diagonale des Fous and a third-place finish there in 2021. However, he’s had a rocky year so far in 2024. Following a DNF at MIUT, he withdrew his name from Lavaredo, citing extreme fatigue. It remains to be seen if he will toe the line at UTMB, but we are crossing our fingers for him to return to full health.
Last year’s TDS winner, Canada’sChristian Meier,makes his 100-mile debut at the 2024 UTMB. The technical 145k TDS appears to be his longest outing to date, but he has plenty of experience at the 100k distance and should be well ready to level up. Amongst his best results are fourth in the 2022 Doi Inthanon 100k and a win at the 2023 Trail Andorra 50k.
Baptiste Chassagneof France has been in the top 10 at a UTMB Mont Blanc festival race for each of the last five editions. In 2018, he took fourth at MCC, followed by sixth in OCC the following year. In 2021 and 2022, he stepped up to CCC, placing ninth and 10th respectively. The 2023 UTMB was his first attempt at 100 miles, and he again placed 10th. It’s hard to bet against him for another top-10 finish this year.
Joaquin Lopezof Ecuador has bags of form at UTMB races and looks like a strong hopeful for a top-10 spot. He just missed out on one last year, coming 11th. Position-wise, this was back from sixth in 2019, but an hour faster than his previous time while on a longer course and in a more competitive field. He’s also placed second in the 2022 TDS, where he was 10th back in 2016. More recently, he took third in the Trail Andorra 105k.
China’sJi Duoplaced 14th at the 2023 UTMB and went on to win that year’s Doi Inthanon 100 Mile by almost an hour and a half — and nearly two hours clear of big names like Beñat Marmissolle of France and Robert Hajnal of Romania, who he will be lining up alongside again for the 2024 UTMB. So far this year, he’s won at the Mount Yun 100k in China, and placed 12th at the Western States 100, a course that’s arguably a bit too runnable for his skill set.
Scott Hawker
New Zealand’sScott Hawkerhas had some of the best runs of his career at UTMB events, placing 15th in last year’s UTMB andthird in 2019. He also took second place in the 2021 CCC. Other top results include second at the 2022 Ultra-Trail Australia 100k.
Italy’sDaniel Junghas form in big mountain 100 milers, having placed fourth in the 2022 Hardrock 100 and won the 2021 Diagonale des Fous. He hasn’t raced UTMB before, but he did come sixth in the 2017 TDS. He also placed third in the 2022 Lavaredo, and this year won the Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100k and the KAT 100 83k.
Miguel Arséniohas had a stack of wins at home in Portugal and a few standout international results, too. These include a second-place finish at the 2023 Transgrancanaria, a win at the 2023 Maxi-Race Annecy, and another at the 2023 Ultra Pirineu 100k. More recently, he won the Swiss Canyon Trail 110k in June of this year in course-record time.
Pablo Villa
Spain’sPablo Villadidn’t finish on his last outing at UTMB in 2021, but he won the 2019 TDS after two DNFs on that route, so a strong comeback is possible. He has a background in Skyrunning and won Transgrancanaria in 2020 and 2022. He has been preparing in a training camp at altitude in Spain’s Sierra Nevada and looks ready to go all in on this year’s UTMB.
Tom Jolyof the U.K. had a strong year in 2023. He placed third in the Transgrancanaria 85k, finished 11th in Trail World Championships Long Trail, won the Ultra Sierra Nevada 59k, took 16th at UTMB, and followed that up by winning the Translantau 129k by more than an hour. So far this year, he’s had a rare DNF at Transgrancanaria but shown good form in some shorter races. He will most likely be looking to improve on last year’s position at UTMB.
Raul Butaciof Romania placed 18th at the 2023 UTMB, but his other results suggest he is capable of a higher placing. He won Transgrancanaria in 2024, up from fourth in 2023, and also placed eighth in the 2022 CCC. While he’s been racing ultras for a few years now, the 2023 UTMB was his first step up to the 100-mile distance, and he will likely be equipped to build on that experience in this year’s race.
Yan-Qiao Yunof China finished just inside the top 20 — in 19th place — at last year’s UTMB. He’s won the Hong Kong 100k twice — in 2013 and 2017 — and placed fifth in 2012. He also placed sixth and 10th, respectively, in the 2019 and 2018 TDS. He had a couple of strong results in the later part of 2023, including a win at the China100 Mountain Cross-Country Race 100k and a second-place at the Translantau 129k. He should be in with a good shot at another top-20 placing.
Seb Spehler
FrenchmanSébastien Spehlerhas a lengthy resume over a range of distances but is fairly new to 100 miles. He failed to finish his first attempt at the distance — the 2022 Western States 100 — but got it right next time, winning the 2024 Trail Alsace Grand Est 100 Mile by nearly an hour. Prior to that, achievements include wins at the 2017 and 2018 Les Templiers, where he also took second in 2021 and 2022. On the other side of the pond, he was second in the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile in 2019, andwon The North Face Endurance Challenge 50 Milethat same year.
Ben Dhiman, an American who lives in France, suffered disappointment in the form of a DNF at last year’s UTMB, but appears to be building well toward a better outcome this year. He bounced back from defeat to take third at the 2023 Les Templiers, won this year’s MIUT, and placed second at the Trail Andorra 100k. His current training ground at altitude in the Pyrenees should help him to replicate the kind of form that saw him win the 2023 Penyagolosa Trails 100k and the 2023 Trail Andorra 100k. He also took third in the 2022 Diagonale des Fous, showing a strong result over 100 miles is well within his scope.
China’sJia-Ju Zhaois hoping it’s third time lucky on the UTMB course. He finished 11th in CCC back in 2019, but failed to finish either of his UTMB starts in 2022 and 2023. He has strong form elsewhere over the 100-mile distance, having won the 2022 Doi Inthanon 100 Mile, and placed second in the 2020 Panda Trail 100 Mile. More recently, he won the 2024 Chongli 100 Mile in China, and if he can avoid whatever pitfalls took him out on the last two occasions, this could be his year at UTMB.
FrenchmanYannick Noëltook third at this year’s Lavaredo. If the UTMB Performance Index can be treated as a reasonable relative metric, this was the best run of his life. He also took third in the 2023 TDS — up from 12th in 2019 — and placed 11th in the 2021 UTMB. His improving form since then would certainly suggest he could be higher up the placings.
Josh Wadehas been making waves at home in the U.K. the past few years, winning Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100 Mile in 2023 by a big margin and taking fourth in the 50k at the same event this year. He failed to finish at last year’s UTMB, but bounced back to take eighth at the 2024 Transgrancanaria. He’s also made it ninth in the 2022 Transvulcania and third in the 2023 Eiger Ultra Trail 100k. He’s probably a strong top-20 candidate going into this year’s UTMB.
Robert Hajnal
Romania’sRobert Hajnalhas had form at UTMB in the past, placing ninth in 2022 andsecond in 2018— one of the worst weather years for the event in recent memory. He also took eighth place at CCC in 2015. He failed to finish last year’s UTMB, and ran an off-the-boil Western States 100 in 2024, where he finished 24th. However, in between those, he ran a great race to finish fourth at the 2023 Doi Inthanon 100 Mile and recently won the Bucovina Ultra Rocks 88k at home in Romania.

2024 Sierre-Zinal Results: Joyline Chepngeno Takes Surprise Win While Kilian Jornet Seals 10th Victory,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-sierre-zinal-results,"The 2024Sierre-Zinalmountain race was thrilling right until the athletes crossed the finish line.Joyline Chepngeno(Kenya) won the women’s race in a breakout performance, whileKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway) took his 10th win of the men’s race, and set a course record by the narrowest of margins.
The race started at 11 a.m. local time on Saturday, August 10, in the village of Sierre, Switzerland, in the heart of the Valais Alps, and featured around 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) of elevation gain over 31 kilometers (19 miles). The event finishes in the village of Zinal.
Sierre-Zinal is an iconic European mountain race and is also known as the ‘race of five 4,000s,’ as the course sits in view of five main Swiss peaks: Weisshorn (4,404 meters), Zinalrothorn (4,221 meters), Obergabelhorn (4,063 meters), Matterhorn (4,478 meters), and Dent Blanche (4,357 meters).
Recently, we used data inthis articleto dive deep into the history and competition of Sierre-Zinal.
The race was simultaneously part of the World Mountain Running Association (WMRA) World Cup and the Golden Trail World Series.
It was a hot start to the day, with temperatures reaching 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) at the start line. There were clear blue skies throughout and dry conditions, with temperatures only getting warmer throughout the race.
There was a shock win for Kenyan athlete Joyline Chepngeno, who had a huge lead throughout, despite it being her first ever trail race. Whilst Kilian Jornet won the race for the 10th time, he was pushed to his limits byPhilemon Ombogo Kiriago(Kenya), last year’s champion who attacked near the close of the race. Read on for the full race story.
This year’s Sierre-Zinal’s biggest story surrounded the women’s winnerJoyline Chepngenoof Kenya, a true underdog in the race. This was Chepngeno’s first ever trail race. After the birth of her two children, Chepngeno lost 30 kilograms and decided to run again, and this was her spectacular debut to the world of trail running.
Not only did Chepngeno win one of the most competitive trail races in the world, but she won by a huge margin. Right from the beginning, she took pole position in the women’s race, and extended her lead throughout.

There was some speculation as to whether Chepngeno was going to be able to maintain the lead, potentially going too hard at the start and unable to fend off more experienced athletes. However, she buried any of the doubts and dominated the women’s race to the end, finishing more than eight minutes clear of her closest competitor.
Whilst Chepngeno took the lead, another ascendant athlete took second place.Scout Adkin(U.K.) was taking part in her longest trail race to date, however she’s been quickly rising through the WMRA World Cup ranks this summer, with prior top performances. She passed through the checkpoint at Ponchette (7.5 kilometers) in 59:29, one minute ahead of one of the race favorites,Joyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya).

Running with Muthoni Njeru wasMonica Mădălina Florea(Romania), who recently took second at the 2024 Marathon du Mont Blanc.
As the runners entered the next checkpoint at Chandolin, Muthoni Njeru overtook Adkin for second place, but this lead was seemingly short lived. On the descent to Tignousa at 16k, it looked as though Muthoni Njeru had overcooked it, and Adkin made a strong attack, retaining her second-place position.
Adkin passed the checkpoint 29 seconds ahead of Muthoni Njeru. Florea continued to maintain her position in fourth a minute back, whilstPhilaries Jeruto Kisang(Kenya) came through in fifth a couple of minutes later.
Unfortunately for Muthoni Njeru, she continued to fade, and this worked to Florea’s advantage. She overtook to take over third place around the 20k mark, now less than two minutes behind Adkin in second. As a powerful downhill runner, this was a chance for Florea to make up ground, but Adkin maintained her position all the way to the finish line.
Joyline Chepngeno crossed the finish line in 2:54:06, taking a huge win. She was followed by Scout Adkin, who finished in 3:02:21, and Monica Mădălina Florea in third in 3:04:29. Philaries Jeruto Kisang moved up to fourth and finished in 3:05:52, andCristina Simion(Romania) finished fifth in 3:07:51.
Joyce Muthoni Njeru dropped out of the top 10 and finished in 12th in 3:13:30.

It was a bold but expected start to the race from favoriteKilian Jornet(Spain, lives in Norway), who already had nine wins to his name on the revered route. He started at the front of the race and looked to have a significant gap on the rest of the field.

However, at the Ponchette checkpoint, 7.5k in,Josphat Kiprotich(Kenya) had closed the gap and came through hot on Jornet’s heels. Switzerland’sRémi Bonnet, the 2022 and 2023 Golden Trail World Series overall winner, came through next, followed byPatrick KipngenoandPaul Machokaof Kenya.
The first twist of the men’s race came shortly thereafter, when Kiprotich overtook Jornet. This is where the first battle at the front of the men’s race commenced and it was a cat-and-mouse chase between the two athletes, with Kiprotich running within 15 seconds of course record pace at the 12k mark.
By halfway, Kiprotich still had a modest lead, coming through the checkpoint in 1:23:15, followed by Jornet in 1:24:01.
Whilst the battle ensued for first, Kipngeno and Bonnet worked together to hold onto third and fourth positions, as they passed through the 16k mark together in 1:25:26.Philemon Ombogo Kiriago(Kenya), the 2023 Sierre-Zinal champion, had by now managed to overtake Machoka to move into fifth place.

After the 20k mark, where most of the climbing had been completed, the race really became unpredictable. Jornet caught up with Kiprotich and they passed the 20k checkpoint in 1:43:17, but this is where Jornet made his attack. He created a 30-second lead on second place, and rolled along the trails whilst others battled it out behind.
Although Kipngeno and Bonnet hit Hotel Weisshorn at the same time (1:45:03), it was Kipngeno who went for the attack and overtook Kiprotich for second place. But that wasn’t the end. Kipngeno’s training partner Ombogo Kiriago steamed ahead, and with a polite tap on the back, powered past Kipngeno and had his sights set on Jornet.
On the technical descent toward the finish line, it looked like Jornet had a comfortable lead when Ombogo Kiriago came out of nowhere to overtake the nine-time winner and even gained on him.
This was by far the biggest shock of the race, and it wasn’t long before Jornet drove down the descent hard to reclaim first position, but he had to work for it all the way to the finish line. Ombogo Kiriago was chasing hard, and the sprint finish through the streets of Zinal led Kilian Jornet to win and also take a new course record, finishing in 2:25:34, beating his previous 2019 course record by a single second.
Philemon Ombogo Kiriago finished just behind in 2:25:36 and the two athletes collapsed as they crossed the line. Patrick Kipngeno held third position and crossed the line in 2:26:59, followed by Josphat Kiprotich in 2:31:35 in fourth, andRoberto Delorenzi(Switzerland) in 2:32:26 for fifth place.
Paul Mochoka ultimately took sixth in 2:32:35, and Rémi Bonnet faded during the latter end of the race and dropped back to ninth position, crossing in 2:33:57.

"2024 Speedgoat by UTMB 50k Results: Sinclair Sets Record, Lowther Wins",https://www.irunfar.com/2024-speedgoat-by-utmb-50k-results,"The 2024Speedgoat by UTMB 50kkicked off at 6:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, July 20, high in Utah’s Wasatch Mountains at the famous Snowbird ski resort. Once all 32 miles (52 kilometers) and 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) of climbing were complete,David Sinclairhad a new course record, while Canada’sJazmine Lowtherled the women’s race from wire to wire.
The weather was truly typical for a high-altitude summer day: fresh crispness in the morning, eventually yielding to a full sun whose heat always feels stronger at altitude.
Sinclair’s no-contest treatment of both the course and the men’s field showed that he was far-and-away the best men’s runner of the day.Samuel Hendry’s(Canada) performance for second place, while holding that position for basically the whole race, was also dominant.
And for Lowther, though the women’s race ran more closely, she, too, showed strength to stay ahead of a big chasing field, including significant pressure from second place byMali Noyes, who made her presence known in the second half of the race.
Read on for more of this year’s Speedgoat 50k story.

It was a tight start to the men’s race, but that didn’t last long. Through the first checkpoint at mile four, a group of eight men rolled through within a minute of each other. Then, at about mile nine and the top of the first major climb, the summit of 11,000-plus-foot Hidden Peak, two men,David SinclairandSamuel Hendry(Canada), who would ultimately go one-two at the finish, passed through together, with more than two minutes on the rest of the field.
Sinclair is familiar with this race, having finished it three times and won it twice before, as recently as 2022. Hendry, an elite cross-country skier and skilled shorter-distance trail runner, looked to be moving up in distance with this race.
Behind them at mile nine, the top-10 men had strung out to within seven minutes of the lead. Among that group and pushing the pace wasAdam Peterman, a prior Speedgoat 50k champion and the then course record holder, andScott Patterson, a two-time Olympian in cross-country skiing and a mountain runner.
From here on, though, it was the Sinclair show, as at each checkpoint, his gap on Hendry — as well as the rest of the field — increased. By mile 20 at the Mineral Basin checkpoint, on the backside of Snowbird ski resort, Sinclair’s lead was just shy of nine minutes, and it only extended from there.
For the race’s final third, it was only the clock that Sinclair raced. When he crossed the line, after summiting Hidden Peak a second time, racking up a boatload of vertical, and taking the fast-and-furious descent back to the base of the ski resort, David Sinclair won in 4:57:35. This broke the previous course record of 5:04:31 set by Peterman in 2021. Sinclair also shaved over 11 minutes off his previous time when he won the race in 2022.

Onto the rest of the men’s race. For as dominant as Sinclair was in first place, so was Hendry in second. By mile 20, Hendry had built a four-minute lead over the rest of the field, which he would hold at each aid station until the finish. Samuel Hendry ultimately crossed the finish line comfortably in second place in 5:24:57, with more than seven minutes on the next chasing man.
At every single aid station, it was Patterson holding a strong third place. So when the Olympian Scott Patterson crossed the line in third with a time of 5:32:26, it should not have come as surprise ending.
David Hedgestook fourth in 5:38:35 andGrant Barnettefifth in 5:45:56.

While the women’s race for the win ran much more closely than in the men’s, Canada’sJazmine Lowthertook the lead from the get-go, never gave in as women ran closely behind her, and put the hammer down to crush the final descent — and the rest of the women’s field. Lowther was coming to this race after recovering from a longer-term injury that followed a pretty incredible couple years of ultrarunning, which saw her win the 2022 Canyons by UTMB 100k and take second at the 2023 Transgrancanaria.
To look at Lowther’s lead over her closest chaser, as the race progressed, it bounced from about a minute at the first checkpoint at mile four and over Hidden Peak for the first time at mile nine, before growing to more than 3.5 minutes by mile 20. She gave back some of that time in the next five rough and verty miles, holding just an 80-second lead when she summited Hidden Peak for the second time at mile 25 and began the big descent to the finish.
Over those final seven-ish miles, Lowther put six minutes on second place. That cracking descent from Jazmine Lowther ensured her victory and she crossed the finish line in 6:15:05.

The race for the rest of the women’s top five was highly dynamic, with women moving around for much of the race. The closest chasers at the first checkpoint at mile four wereEmkay SullivanandMartina Valmassoi(Italy), the former of whom would remain dominant all race and the latter of whom would need to drop due to physical issues.
After over 6,000 feet of climb since the start of the race, over the first summit of Hidden Peak at mile nine,Emily Caldwellalso made her presence known, passing over Hidden Peak in second place, with Sullivan right there in third.
Over the next 11 miles, another runner presented herself a challenger,Mali Noyes, a prior two-time finisher who took second last year. The cross-country and downhill skier at least partially converted to trail running a few years ago, and has been racking up experience in American trail races. Noyes moved into second place for the women before mile 18 and then held it to the finish. Mali Noyes’s impressive climb up the leaderboard in the first half, before holding steady in the race’s second half, led her to finish in second place in 6:22:31.
Much like Noyes in second place moved into that position before mile 18, so did ultimate women’s third-place finisherKodi Kleven. Kleven is a local runner, coach, and former collegiate runner who finished seventh at the 2022 Speedgoat 50k, so she was looking to move up this year.
And also like Noyes, Kleven’s gap on the rest of the field stayed fairly close and fluctuated. For Kleven, her breakaway from the rest of the field took place on the beefy climb back up to Hidden Peak for a second time at mile 25. There, Kleven had carved out a fairly comfortable seven-minute lead, which she extended to 11 minutes by the finish line. Kodi Kleven crossed the finish line in 6:24:12 for third place.
Emkay Sullivan ultimately finished fourth in 6:35:09.Lindsay Allisonalso moved up during the latter half of the race, finishing in fifth in 6:41:39.

Katharina Hartmuth Post-2024 Hardrock 100 Interview,https://www.irunfar.com/katharina-hartmuth-post-2024-hardrock-100-interview,"In her debut at the event, Germany’sKatharina Hartmuthfinished third at the 2024Hardrock 100despite dealing with a variety of issues throughout the race. During this interview, she talks about the first half of the race where she felt good, the bladder and vision issues that plagued her during the second 50 miles, and how she relied on motivation from her pacer to get over the final climb to the finish.
For more on how the race played out, check out our in-depth2024 Hardrock 100 resultsarticle.
﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar I’m withKatharina Hartmuth, it’s the day after the2024 Hardrock 100 Endurance Run. You’re the women’s third-place finisher, how does that sound and feel?
Hartmuth:It feels great. Yeah, it’s a bit unexpected, but I take it. So I’m really happy.
iRunFar:You had such a mixed approach to this race. You had some injuries in the winter that we talked about in our pre-race interview, had some good training, and then had a pretty major back injury just a couple weeks before the race. So going into the race, you were worried about your back, but as it turns out, were there other things to worry about in this race?
Hartmuth:Yes. So luckily, the back seemed not to be a problem at all, but instead as usual, other problems occurred. So, yeah, well, no. First of all, I’m super happy that the back hold up so well because even at the morning of the race, I thought, nah, let’s see. Maybe I have to drop out at the 10k because it’s just not possible. But yeah, I’m just so happy that the back is okay.
iRunFar:So we can put the back thing to rest, at least for now.
Hartmuth:Yes.
iRunFar:The race starts, I think you spend some of the early miles withCourtney Dauwalter, and then the three top women in the group, yourself,Camille Bruyas, and Courtney sort of strung out a little bit in the early miles. Is that how it sort of went?
Hartmuth:Yeah, so I started with Courtney behind this group of men that were at the top. And yeah, it was nice. We had a nice little chat on the Rainbow Trail until the river crossing, and then in the ascent and the first climb, I let her go. I was like, “You should go,” because she asked me if I would like to work together with her, and I was like, “Nah, I don’t think so. I shouldn’t push myself too hard in the first climb.”
So I let her go. And then Camille, she came at some point and we run a bit together, but then I said the same to her. I was like, “I always start my races with an easy pace.” Well, it’s a high pace, but I have to start slow. And I think here it was exactly right because on the second climb, I already realized that I struggled a bit with nausea and had a light headache. So the altitude…I was like, I really have to take it easy and just do my thing and don’t try to stick with the others.
iRunFar:A lot of runners have said that the heat of the first day ended up being an issue. I mean, it wasn’t severely hot, but it was a lot of heat for this altitude. Did you feel that or what were the pain points of the first day of running for you?
Hartmuth:So heat never really bothers me. I don’t like it, but I think I can deal with it quite well.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:So it was hot, especially in the valleys, but for me, it was not that much of an issue.
iRunFar:Not too bad.
Hartmuth:No, I was actually glad that there was no rain or thunderstorms to be afraid.
iRunFar:That was the weather that you were the most worried about.
Hartmuth:Yeah.
iRunFar:I think as the race went on, you say it was an easier pace for you, but you were not that far behind Camille and Courtney in front of you. The gap at each aid station was just a couple minutes longer, not any big gaps of time. So to me, it seemed like the three of you were really running your own races, but they were really not that far apart from each other. It was just like parallel missions.
Hartmuth:Yeah. Yeah. I was actually excited to see that. I mean, I never want to hear any splits from my crew-
iRunFar:Okay, this is the no-split crew.
Hartmuth:Even when I was with my pacer later, he always was the first to tell the aid station, we don’t want any splits. But obviously when you’re that in front of the race, almost people will tell you.
So I had a rough idea of where I was and where the girls were, and I think for me it was exciting, especially to see that we had three women in the top six for a long time. I was like, that’s cool.
iRunFar:It’s super cool.
Hartmuth:Yeah. I mean, I knew that I would have to run my own race because it’s such a long race, and the night was still ahead, and I didn’t know if my back was holding up for the entire race. So I was just like, okay, do your own thing.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hartmuth:But it was good.
iRunFar:It’s said at Hardrock that for the fast runners who take not all of 48 hours to finish it, that the race is really broken into two parts, the daytime and then the nighttime. I think you had a really different nighttime than your daytime.
Hartmuth:Yes.
iRunFar:What happened for you in the nighttime, and what was the timeline of how things unfolded for you?
Hartmuth:Yeah, So I can basically split my race in two halves.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:First 15 hours were great, and the second 15 hours were terrible.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:Yeah. Well, the problems began already when it was still daylight because I somehow developed a bladder infection, which was painful when running.
iRunFar:Very painful.
Hartmuth:Yeah. So it bothered me not so much on the hiking on the uphill, but as soon as I was running, it was just super uncomfortable.
iRunFar:Like feeling the organ kind of jostle.
Hartmuth:Yeah. And it was just pain. And so especially remember that road coming down from Oh Point to Animas. I mean, usually I should be able to run the whole road, but I couldn’t because it was just unbearable. So every couple of minutes I had to just take a short walking break and that, well, it was a bit annoying. I wondered how that would play out throughout the rest of the night. But the main problem actually really occurred in the night because, as I said earlier, I had already problems with the fueling due to me feeling not so well on the first and on the second and third climb. So I already accumulated the deficit in calories, and it’s always difficult for me to fuel during the night. It’s way harder for me than during the day. And I think I pushed myself maybe a bit too hard on Handies, and I really felt it when I was on top of Handies. I was like, oh, I need to get in some calories. But then I forgot about it on the downhill and it just accumulated. And I mean, I made it to Sherman and still felt not too bad. And I picked up my pace and we did the climb, and still it was all fine. But then on the top of the climb in the middle of the night, I was just, okay, now it’s going downhill.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:From one moment to the next, I felt awful. I could just not move well anymore. And that was really a hard time up there. I think I’ve never been that low in a race in terms of just how I felt. And then we spent, I think 30 minutes in the Pole Creek station just trying to get something inside me that I wouldn’t throw up again. So that was really tricky, and I knew that I had to eat. There was no hope for finishing the race without eating, but at the same time, I just felt so sick all the time. So that was really, really tough. And I think we managed somehow to get a little bit out of it with daylight approaching. But in the end it was again a problem for the last climb, I felt really awful again.
iRunFar:Okay, so you haven’t mentioned the eyesight thing.
Hartmuth:Yeah.
iRunFar:So yeah, there’s the bladder, there’s the fueling deficit and not having the energy to move how you wanted, and then your eyes went at some point?
Hartmuth:So obviously there was something else.
iRunFar:Obviously, because trouble comes in threes and we have to have our third.
Hartmuth:Like with my crashes. I have three crashes, so I know three other major issues in the race. So yeah, when daylight was approaching, I was finally a bit better with the calories. Suddenly I had the problem that I lost my vision to a large part. So it was all blurry and foggy in front of my eyes. And I think the big problem was that I could not see the markers anymore, and I also could not see the map on my watch, so I couldn’t check on my watch if I’m still on the right path.
iRunFar:At least your watch wasn’t beeping at you or something, right?
Hartmuth:No, no, no. But it was very challenging and I was lucky that I was with my pacer who could basically show me the way, but at some point I lost my pacer because I had to drop him. And, yeah, it was really tricky going down to Cunningham, basically seeing…
iRunFar:Nothing.
Hartmuth:… only a few blurred colors, and I couldn’t even recognize my crew when arriving in Cunningham and it was a bit embarrassing,
iRunFar:In Maggie Gulch aid station, which is the second to last major aid station, you stayed for maybe 10, 12, 14 minutes to fuel yourself, and then you had a longer stop in Cunningham. Maybe you were even in the medical tent for a bit?
Hartmuth:Yeah, I think in Cunningham it was even 40 minutes.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:Because again, I was just so low with my energy and I had to eat something to make it over that climb. And then I had this eye problem and they tried to help me with some eye drops which at least it got a little bit better. But I knew that I had to take someone with me over that climb because I knew the road that was coming up, and I wouldn’t have been able to do that road without help because I just couldn’t see the stones in the road. And that road was so painful to run down. I think this is the race I’ve spent the most time in aid stations just sitting there and trying to get some food in and just to …
iRunFar:Recover yourself a little bit.
Hartmuth:… recover, yeah. So, actually, when we started the last climb, I wasn’t sure if I would make it. It seemed impossible because I was so low and I couldn’t see anything. So it was just like, what am I doing here? But at the same time I thought, well, I’ve made it so far now, it would be a pity to not finish. So luckily my crew, she was really good and she was like, “You have to get up there. There’s no way out of this, and we will bring you to the stone.” And yeah, we made it.
iRunFar:I love the ending of the race in whichever direction you go, because you get this little run into town, you’re closing the loop. You’ve come from way out in some of the most remote places of the San Juan Mountains back to this tiny civilization. And there’s just this aesthetic thing about closing the loop and getting to do that approach. Did you have any feelings as you were coming through town of, yes, I’ve finally done this through all of the challenges, or were you just numb to it. Let’s just get there and I’ll think about things later?
Hartmuth:Yeah, I think I was still very numb.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:When I came down the trail because I was like, “Damn it, I’m just done.” It took a lot out of me, especially the last climb. And then when I came to the finish line, I think first I was actually a bit disappointed because I saw that I was over 30 hours and I knew that without all these stops and the fueling issues, I mean it would’ve been two or three hours faster.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hartmuth:And that was a bit disappointing for me because I had the legs for a good time. But then when I was at the rock, I was like, no, it’s good.
iRunFar:A 30-and-a-half-hour Hardrock is a wonderful day.
Hartmuth:It’s definitely not a bad, no, no, no. And especially when I considered everything that happened and when I then realized how much time I also spent not running during this 30 hours.
iRunFar:That adds up too, right?
Hartmuth:That adds up to quite some time, yeah. So no, then as soon as I was at the finish line, actually, it was a very positive moment.
iRunFar:One of the worst questions to ask today after a hundred miler, but it’s the one that most people are curious about. You’re from abroad, so coming to race Hardrock is a really big deal in the first place, but now you are a finisher of Hardrock, which makes it a little bit easier to get in another time.
Hartmuth:Hopefully, let’s see.
iRunFar:I mean, would a second Hardrock be something you would like to do someday?
Hartmuth:Yes. I was told by certain people that you have to do the other way around as well, to be a real Hardocker.
iRunFar:Well, I guess that means you have to put in again.
Hartmuth:Yeah, I thought so much doing the race about how it would be running the other way around. I am very curious because I think that the other way around, I think this, how we did it this year, the clockwise round is maybe my favorite.
iRunFar:Okay.
Hartmuth:But I still have to see how it is the other way around.
iRunFar:There is a certain person on the, iRuFar team who likes to say that their favorite is, “Whichever direction the race is going.”
Hartmuth:Yeah, possibly. I will say this then after I’ve done the other way.
iRunFar:Or the best way is the one that you get the entry to do, right?
Hartmuth:Exactly. No, I mean, I would be super stoked to come back. Actually, this year, it was a bit tough to get here in the first place because I was on my own and organizing everything. I was quite exhausted.
iRunFar:But now you know your way around, you’re going to be a Hardrock pro.
Hartmuth:Yeah, and now I know so many more people here, which is super helpful. And now I’ve been here, I’ve seen the mountains. I experienced how beautiful they are, and I think I’ve really fallen in love a bit with the place here. So yeah, it’s not that difficult when you have such a great, great mountain.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hartmuth:No, I definitely want to be back. And I mean if I can’t make it as a runner, then maybe as a pacer or crew, or whatever that is.
iRunFar:That is music to my personal ears. My last question for you, Hardrock is a pretty challenging race in and of its own, but you may have something even more challenging on your race calendar for this year.
Hartmuth:I think so, yes.
iRunFar:You’re going to race the Tor de Géants in the start of September or mid-September.
Hartmuth:Yes. Well, beginning of September.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hartmuth:Yeah, exactly. So I thought a lot about this also during the race because I was like, ah, that’s another Hardrock added.
iRunFar:It’s probably not something you should think about in the middle of that.
Hartmuth:Yeah, especially not when you’re in a bad place and hurting. No, I’m really much looking forward to it. It will be the first time for me racing over a hundred miles. And I think, especially the sleep deprivation, that’s a big topic that doesn’t really arise in a hundred miler, but when you go beyond, it will. So that’s something that I really don’t know how it’ll work out, and I’m really excited to find out.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hartmuth:And also a bit scared, but I’ve seen parts of the course already last year, and it’s so beautiful over there. It’s a huge challenge, but I really would like to complete it this year. And yeah, let’s see how things will turn out.
iRunFar:Well, there is a big, beautiful finisher’s breakfast waiting for you just over there that has your name on it.  Katharina Hartmuth, congratulations on your first Hardrock finish and your third-place finish at 2024 edition.
Hartmuth:Thanks very much.

Schlarb:Run Rabbit Run [100 Mile], the first course record and that are my two I think most proud runs or races I’ve ever done.
iRunFar:Well, we’re going to change that in this conversation because you’ve had one hell of a hard three years.
Schlarb:Yeah, yeah.
iRunFar:I felt bad writing the preview, being like, “Here’s all that Jason’s done, and he hasn’t been even quite close to that level yet,” since your first ski injury and all that. We’ll get into the details, but how does it feel to have a top level performance?
Schlarb:I’m a critic of myself always, and the great news is I have the fitness. I have the strength. Looking atLudo[vic Pommeret], I am in the late 40s and in my body, I had a sub 23 yesterday. At mile 55, I started puking and really didn’t take nutrition solidly for the rest of the race. But yes, the last three years has been rough. After my knee surgery, the meniscus, I had another one to trim up the meniscus last year, and no, I haven’t been able to put those performances together, but now it’s good to have the fitness, the strength, the health, and be back at Hardrock and get on the podium.
iRunFar:Yeah. So you were talking, you had the fitness to get 23. How do you have that confidence, again, when you have them… I mean, the workouts, again, what made you think that I can…?
Schlarb:Well, I know me, and I know Jason Schlarb of 2016, and I’ve lived here for 10 years. This is my home. I know the routes, I know the segments. I know the Strava. I know the data. I know my speed workouts, and even working with my coach,David Roche, he knows how I have been and what I can do, and so to get to that place… I’ve actually been there, believe it or not, since the end of last year. But due to some… My stomach has been really giving me a problem the last three years, so I went toMadeira [Island Ultra-Trail]this spring and had a 20 something place, but I, again, wasn’t able to fuel. In training and everything, things are great. Fantastic. I’m back. The knee is strong. Everything’s good.
iRunFar:Yeah, so you’re out there yesterday.
Schlarb:Yeah.
iRunFar:You started in no man’s land off the bat. Are you in fourth by yourself? For how long? Are you actually in fourth alone or what’s the first quarter, half the race like?
Schlarb:We went across Mineral Creek and went up Bear and we were together and I was able to hang out,Diego [Pazos], myself,François [D’Haene]. Ludo was just a little bit up ahead, but yeah, Ludo and François started to take off. I know the course, I know this place. I know my body. I knew exactly what I needed to do, and so patience was the right choice for me, and then slowly start to pass and get up there and catching François when he was climbing up Bear Creek, I was like, “Okay, I’m ready. This is the right spot.”
iRunFar:Bear Creek in Ouray?
Schlarb:Yeah, sorry.
iRunFar:There’s three of them on the course.
Schlarb:Yeah, a time later. But I ran my own race. I’d like to run by myself despite running with Kilian from Handies to the finish in 2016. When I first saw him, I was like, “No, I don’t want to be your entertainment. I don’t like to be around other people. I want to run every step exactly how I want to. That’s my style.” But that was when things went south a little bit, and then I ran back and forth with Diego a lot.
iRunFar:Yeah. Well, you were for, I don’t know how many miles, it could have been almost half the race, it felt like you were 10 minutes ahead of Diego.
Schlarb:Yeah.
iRunFar:Was that just at the aid stations and the splits and that, or on the course was it a little more dynamic?
Schlarb:I was in front of Diego for quite a while, and when I passed François just before Engineer Pass, I wasn’t even thinking about Diego, because Diego said, “Oh”… I felt like the altitude must be getting to him. François knows. He’s been here. He obviously has success and Ludo being here, I trained with him a bit. He stayed in my cabin and I knew that he was ready too. But Diego, I wasn’t certain that he was going to do well, and I didn’t know where he was behind me. I wasn’t asking for information or anything at the aid stations. I was just focused on getting close as I can to Ludo. That was my goal. But then I saw him coming down Camp Bird Road, and I was like, “Okay, let’s go,” and threw down some sub-seven [minute] miles and thought he was done. But then again, my stomach kind of went, and so then Diego and I had got to have like we did in Oman a number of years ago, we got to spend a lot of time going back and forth.
iRunFar:Yeah. What was that race like to the finish? When did he make his final pass, and did you feel like you were then still racing to catch him in second place?
Schlarb:No.
iRunFar:No?
Schlarb:No. It was more survival, unfortunately, and I’m kind of ashamed to say that it was just like, it wasn’t so much of a race. It was like, okay, I’m taking maybe 50 to 80 calories every two hours and I’m drinking water to the tune of maybe 10 ounces every two hours, because I just couldn’t, and it would just keep coming up, and so it was more of a, this is all I possibly could do. Diego could literally be as close as you are to me, and I couldn’t pass him. That’s how I felt. Going down the descent through the final descent, I started walking down the descent. When the legs don’t get fuel and they don’t get hydration for hours.
iRunFar:Running on empty at Hardrock is a long, grueling experience.
Schlarb:It wasn’t really a strategic racing thing. It was like, “I’m doing my absolute fastest every single step.”
iRunFar:It might not be very fast for you. Yeah.
Schlarb:But I mean, at the top of Cunningham/Little Giant, Diego is almost… not as close as this, but he was a minute ahead of me, but I knew that as soon as he went down, he was descending better than I was. I’m not sure what his issues were and stuff and how he was doing, but I knew that there was no way I was going to be catching him.
iRunFar:But you still ended up with a third-place finish.
Schlarb:Yes.
iRunFar:And a very solid run. And so you have the confidence going into the race kind of knowing what your performance is, but I know it wasn’t a perfect race, but can you get more confidence in the aspect of actualizing it? You can have the fitness, but if you can’t put it mostly together on race day, what does that mean? And you largely did, if not did.
Schlarb:Yeah. I’m in shape. I’m strong. I’m altitude adjusted, and I was able to put most of that together yesterday, and I’m happy about that. I’m excited. I’m signed up forTDS.
iRunFar:You beat me to it. Yeah. You got TDS coming along.
Schlarb:Yeah. The most technical, I think coolest trails of theUTMBrace series. I’m excited to try this TDS thing out. It’s pretty close, but I’ve got a lot of experience. I’m older. I feel like I can do more of these kind of crazy moves I think with this.
iRunFar:I hate to say it, but the old man strength kind of starts along wisdom, experience.
Schlarb:Yeah, just likeCourtney [Dauwalter]was able to run those three hundreds last year. You get to a point where you can really manage things just right, especially in training. In racing, I haven’t quite got it all the time. I know that Courtney too had stomach issues yesterday, so yeah.
iRunFar:You’re not alone in that.
Schlarb:I know.
iRunFar:I haven’t talked to Ludo about his details, but he probably did too.
Schlarb:Well, with the sport changing and being able to take more carbs per hour is such an advantage. I’ve seen it in my training. I know it absolutely works. I do it for all my long runs, but I haven’t been able to dial it in the race, and that’s the piece of the puzzle I’m trying to figure out now.
iRunFar:I hadn’t thought about asking you this until just now. It’s like you’re 46, right?
Schlarb:Yeah.
iRunFar:And Ludo is 48. We’re in a sport where you think the competitive level’s not just gone up a little bit. It’s leapt up, and there’s a lot of fast younger folks, whether that means 20s or 30s, but here you are, and the two of you, Diego’s not the youngest runner either, but what do you think about that?
Schlarb:Gosh, there’s just some… I feel like I’m gifted, so is Ludo, and I think that’s that natural talent part, and then also right here, particularly in these kind of races, even UTMB or Hardrock, it takes so much more than how fast can you run and how young are you. How quickly can you recover. How springy are those muscles. It becomes, I can run pretty fast for a really long time and never quit, never have that mental breakdown. I think that that’s a big part of it, and then slowly moving to the mountains. There’s so much multifactorial things to running fast at a tough, slow, long, hard hundred miler.
iRunFar:Awesome. Well, congrats on your great race here. Good luck at TDS. Thank you, Jason.
Schlarb:Thank you.

In this interview, she talks about running with Courtney Dauwalter and Katharina Hartmuth in the early miles of the event, her issues with getting food down while out on course, and how she had to take an extended break at a couple of aid stations in order to consume the calories she needed to finish.

﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunfar. I’m withCamille Bruyas.It’s the day after the 2024Hardrock 100Endurance Run. You’re the second-place women’s finisher. How does that feel, and how does that sound?
Camille Bruyas:Yes, I realized just now because yesterday I was so destroyed, and my head was completely tired. But yeah, today I’m okay.
iRunFar:The awards have just finished, and so you got to be honored for that second-place position. Maybe it’s starting to sink in a little bit? Like how despite your difficulties, you had such a good race. You were second place.
Bruyas:Yeah, it was hard until Maggie to the end, but yeah, the night was hard. It was cold. I was not enough with some clothes to be safe. So yeah, it was super hard. The hardest race I ever did, for sure. I really wanted to drop at Maggie and say, okay, I want to stop. But my pacerMarianne [Hogan]said, “No, no, no. Keep going.”
iRunFar:Let’s backtrack for just a second to the parts of the race where you felt good, the first half. I think you felt really good. You were running so strong, and you had a big smile on your face for so many miles. Talk us through the parts of the race that you felt good. Like, how about the first climb, the second climb, where there were so many people cheering? Tell us about that.
Bruyas:Yeah, the first climb was, for me, slow. And just start slowly, but the second climb, it was amazing because many, many people are cheering there.
iRunFar:And also cheering there and then watching you go off of Grant Swamp, too.
Bruyas:Yeah, yeah. It was scary because this downhill is not super easy. And after, I joinedCourtney [Dauwalter]on the next downhill, so it was nice to share some miles with her on the next uphill to Kroger’s Canteen, which for me is the best place. It’s super nice. It’s super beautiful, you know. After Telluride, I love this part. So, yeah, I was super, super nice until Telluride. And after, to Ouray it was okay, but after Ouray it was hot.
iRunFar:So hot.
Bruyas:Yeah, you start to have 70 kilometers on the legs. But with Marianne, we keep going until into the night and Handies Peak. Handies Peak is super hard because with the altitude, it’s hard to eat, and I think I start to eat less and less and less until Maggie. So I think in Maggie I was no energy, nothing I can eat, nothing. It was cold. So many things go wrong on these points, but now I understand why.
iRunFar:The long section before Maggie you see crew at Sherman, and then you go into the night for a long, long time by yourself. And you said you weren’t eating enough, and you were out there with not enough. You should have had more clothes, you think?
Bruyas:Yeah.
iRunFar:So you felt like you slowed down, you couldn’t generate heat, and you couldn’t eat and make energy, so was it just a matter of putting your head down and just going step by step?
Bruyas:Yeah, yeah. I just want to finish, so I think okay. Step by step to this climb, this climb, this climb, this downhill. The downhill was super painful for me because I had stretched quadriceps. But it was okay.
iRunFar:So, I was at Maggie Gulch when you came in, and the first thing that you wanted to know was the gap to the person behind you. The aid station gave you an estimate. Two, two and a half miles, something like that. And then it was like you thought you would sit down, use some time to get warm, to try to eat and drink.
Bruyas:Yeah.
iRunFar:And then not use all the time like between you and that woman, but use some of the time to take care of yourself. Is that what happened?
Bruyas:Yeah. At Maggie I just want to, because when you have the crew at the beginning of the race, if you didn’t eat too much during your running and racing, it’s okay because you have the crew. And you can eat more what you want. But when after Sherman, you have a long time where you have to eat in the aid station.
iRunFar:On your own.
Bruyas:Yeah, on your own. So, you have to manage this thing, and in Pole Creek I didn’t stop a lot. Maggie is like, I need to stop because it’s long.
iRunFar:Yeah. I was impressed because it was clear you felt bad physically and mentally, but I was impressed at how much you were able to eat. You took a lot of soup and some chips.
Bruyas:Yeah.
iRunFar:Like, you still had a stomach. A lot of people at Maggie did not have a stomach anymore.
Bruyas:Yeah, sure. That’s why I’m saying, okay, you can’t eat, you can eat. So focus on this, and keep going.
iRunFar:Yeah. And so in Maggie, you were in a chair with a blanket and I don’t know, kind of desperate looking? And then all of a sudden you shed the blanket and you marched out of the aid station just like immediately. It wasn’t like, now I’m going to get ready to go. It was, you were gone. You were still like, committed to the mission.
Bruyas:Yeah. Yeah, because I was super cold. If I stay here, I will stay here for a long time.
iRunFar:I will not leave here.
Bruyas:Yeah, sure. So, yeah, when I decided to keep going, it’s like, okay, let’s go.
iRunFar:There’s still 18 miles or 30 kilometers from Maggie to the finish.
Bruyas:Yeah.
iRunFar:It became harder for you. It got even harder.
Bruyas:Yeah, it’s hard, the end, because the last climb super steep, super long. And yeah, the sun come so it was hot.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Bruyas:So yeah, this race never ending.
iRunFar:You stayed for a break in Cunningham Gulch with your crew to, kind of like Maggie, to rest and eat some food, I think.
Bruyas:Yeah. Yeah, because I couldn’t eat while I’m running.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Bruyas:And everything sometimes go outside. So yeah, I said in Cunningham I need to eat. I can’t go this uphill if I didn’t eat, because it could be super, super hard. And you can make many, many times on this uphill. So that’s work. I ate a lot in Cunningham so I can finish.
iRunFar:Okay. Was there ever a point before the finish line where you were able to, I don’t know, breathe a sigh of relief and say, okay, I’m going to make it. I can enjoy a few miles. Or was all enjoyment done at that point?
Bruyas:Yeah, I was super slow. I was walking with my friends, so I said just before the finish, okay, it’s okay. You can enjoy. You can enjoy people, and we can speak. So that was fun, and it was okay.
iRunFar:Okay.
Bruyas:But in my mind, I was completely destroyed and more negative, I think. But today I understand more what I did. But yesterday I was just, I’m super, super shit. I’m super bad. I’m super slow. But, you know, when you are in this mood, it’s hard to disconnect when you’re super tired, and you didn’t sleep.
iRunFar:I think it’s like our nature to recognize the things that we do poorly, before we recognize the things that we do well, but to run 29.5 hours at Hardrock with so many difficulties, that’s a very good time and that’s a very good performance. So, I hope with some time you can recognize that.
Bruyas:Thank you.
iRunFar:You have been here. You came here, you did Softrock. You adjusted to the altitude. You did Hardrock one time. Do you feel like now that you’ve learned it, do you feel like you might want to come back and try again and try to figure it out?
Bruyas:Yeah, maybe, and it’s interesting here because one year is in one side and the other loop. So yeah, maybe, why not?
iRunFar:Last question for you. Do you have other races or plans or adventures for this year, or are you just going into rest mode now?
Bruyas:Maybe adventure, but no races.
iRunFar:Anything fun to talk about?
Bruyas:Yeah. No, not fun, but around house.
iRunFar:Okay.
Bruyas:Yeah, some trails I want to go, some challenge and adventure with friends. So yeah, first during the summer will be that. Maybe one race, but a shorter one for sure, at the end of the year. Because 100 miles for me, it’s hard.
iRunFar:It’s a lot.
Bruyas:Yeah, you have to recover mentally. And physically, it’s okay, but mentally you need to be back with a strong energy.
iRunFar:So maybe we see you at something in the fall.
Bruyas:Yeah.
iRunFar:Depending on the recovery.
Bruyas:Yeah.
iRunFar:Congratulations to you on your first Hardrock finish.
Bruyas:Thank you.
iRunFar:And congratulations on your second place.
Bruyas:Thank you, Meghan.

﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withDiego Pazosafter his second-place finish at the 2024Hardrock 100. How are you, Diego?
Diego Pazos:Hi, Bryon. I’m fine. Very fine.
iRunFar:Yeah? Did you have an enjoyable day out there? Or two days.
Pazos:Yes, with high highs and downs, but I enjoyed this day every minute.
iRunFar:Before we get into the play-by-play, because it was kind of an interesting race for such a small field, what did you enjoy on the course, outside of the racing?
Pazos:The landscapes. I think, I didn’t know Kroger’s Canteen, Handies Peak, so I discovered everything during the race. And yeah, it was fabulous. I had the sunset at Handies Peak. That was fabulous.
iRunFar:Yeah?
Pazos:It was a dream. All red behind. It was like, wow.
iRunFar:Yeah, so you got to enjoy it.
Pazos:Yeah.
iRunFar:And you were able to take that in during the race, a little bit.
Pazos:Yeah, a little bit. It was a hard moment for me at that point, but it helped me. Yeah, knowing that it’s unique to be here at that point of the race, so I cannot give up, and I have to continue and give it all.
iRunFar:Yeah. So going to how the race sort of happened. Early in the race, you’re out there withLudovic [Pommeret],François [D’haene]. It’s a francophone start to the race. Were you, at least for some time, running together and chatting, or was this racing from go?
Pazos:No, no, no. It was a nice pace at the beginning. We were four, withJason [Schlarb]as well.Courtney [Dauwalter]just behind, maybe 50 meters behind. And then after the first downhill, we went, the three, with François and Ludo. I was feeling good. It was good at the first checkpoint and everything. And they went away at the second climb. I didn’t want to follow this rhythm. I want to keep in my bubble. But the first climb, it was nice. It was a nice talk. Jason was the botanist. He was explaining to us all the flowers of the region. It was nice.
iRunFar:And you enjoyed those as well?
Pazos:Yeah, yeah, sure.
iRunFar:It’s a perfect time of year for the wildflowers here in the San Juan Mountains.
Pazos:Columbine and everything, all the flowers. It was wonderful.
iRunFar:So, starting at about 20 kilometers, you’re on your own.
Pazos:Yeah.
iRunFar:And for quite a long time, yes?
Pazos:Yes. The uphill to Kroger’s Canteen, Jason came back and he passed me. And I was not in a good moment. I was stuck. I had no power hiking. So, it was a hard moment. I said, okay, it will pass. You have to learn. Use your experience in ultra to say, okay, that’s a bad moment. I let him go. And I went, and then we went down. Very technical descent after Kroger’s Canteen. Very nice experience. And then, yeah, the long descent to Ouray. And then I came back, and I was maybe one or two minutes just behind him. And from Ouray until the end, I would say the big fight with Jason started.
iRunFar:Yeah. For a long time, you were maybe 10 minutes behind him.
Pazos:Yeah.
iRunFar:And unlike him, you know the difference. You can hear at the aid stations.
Pazos:I can see him.
iRunFar:You can see him. What was that like? Was it a consistent difference in time?
Pazos:It was always changing.
iRunFar:Oh, changing. Okay.
Pazos:Yeah. You could see only that it was 10 minutes because he was taking me on the uphills.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Pazos:And then in the downhills, I was reducing the distance. And sometimes I was passing him. He was passing me again. In the night, it was a, how do you say, a back and forth?
iRunFar:Yeah. Back and forth. A battle.
Pazos:A big battle.
iRunFar:Which doesn’t look like it on the splits and in the aid stations. It was always him ahead.
Pazos:Yeah. He was more ahead than I was.
iRunFar:Okay.
Pazos:More time. But from Pole Creek, I passed him just after the checkpoint of Pole Creek. And then we did a mistake. I mean, I went up and then I went down the same way. And I was two minutes ahead. So, I saw him going up again. So, we went with him. At that point, we were together. And then going to Maggie’s, I had maybe two, three minutes advantage. I kept the advantage until Cunningham. Three, four minutes. And I knew in the last uphill that he was better than me, maybe. I was feeling better. So, he was not increasing the gap in the uphill. So I could be on the top of the last uphill with maybe one minute, 1:30. And then I knew that in the downhill, I was going to give it all. And that I was feeling a bit better than him going downhill. So, at the end, that’s what happened.
iRunFar:For me, that feels like a nightmare to be, I mean, it doesn’t matter if you’re further back in the pack. But if you’re trying to run for first, second, third, and being 10 kilometers out with one minute.
Pazos:Yeah.
iRunFar:Is that scary? Exciting? For you, what is that emotion like?
Pazos:Both. Scaring and exciting. But if you want to perform, you have to be used to that. I’m quite used to it since the years. It can be for podium, it can be for top 10 positions. You always have to fight. And it doesn’t give you the time to breathe. You know, you have to check point, you have to go. You have to put the pressure. He’s putting the pressure on you. So, it’s a game. And we know each other very well with Jason. So we enjoyed it a lot. It was good.
iRunFar:So you do end up finishing second. A great performance for you. Are you happy with it?
Pazos:Very happy. Yes. I mean, for me, it’s perfect. Ludo was on another planet on that day. And I’m very happy because I had a very hard preparation. I had big health problems. I had with the family, with work, it’s not easy for me to put volume, to train really well. When you are not professional and you are busy work, it’s hard. So I’m very, very happy, very proud of my performance. And mentally, I think I was really, really strong yesterday. And this helped me a lot at the end of the race.
iRunFar:So, it’s hard to get into this race. But do you think you’ll put your name in ever again to come back to Hardrock?
Pazos:I mean, when you see the landscape and everything, I cannot say no. I hope so. But I cannot say now when, and if it will be. Because, you know, it’s a lot of organization for me. But I mean, it’s one of my best souvenirs, for sure. I will keep in mind always. And why not? I will be happy to come back. Yeah.
iRunFar:What do you have on your schedule for the rest of the year? Any big highlights coming up?
Pazos:I give me the next two weeks to recover. Because I’m not a person that does many hundred miles, many races. I prefer to focus on some races. I don’t have time to do the rest of the things. But maybe I would love to doGrand Raid de la Réunion, Diagonale des Fous.
iRunFar:Yeah?
Pazos:We’ll see. I will be atUTMB, but more for cheering.
iRunFar:Okay. So that leads me to a question, then.UTWT [Ultra-Trail World Tour], you ran when that was the first years, you’ve been doing that for a long time. You’ve been doing high-level ultra running for a long time. People who you were racing at the top level in the UTW races, a lot of them aren’t racing anymore, or are not racing at a high level. Maybe do you have an advantage in longevity in the sport? Because, not just because you’re choosing not to race a ton of races, but having a profession and not being able to. Is that an advantage? Not in an individual race, but in your career?
Pazos:Sure. For me, the objective is the career. I want my kids, as well, to see me running still, to see this atmosphere. I think we have very good values in trail running, in ultra trail running. So, I want to last. And I think if you have something next to the running, as well, if you preserve yourself, you can last longer. And of course, I think it helped me, and I hope it will help me as well in the future.
iRunFar:Awesome.
Pazos:When you see Ludo, for me, it’s an example. I mean, for sure, he’s 49 soon, and he’s still at top level. If not one of the now two, three, four best ultra trail runners in the world. Yeah, he’s going to be at UTMB. It’s going to be interesting.
iRunFar:Awesome. Well, congratulations on your great run here, and I can’t wait to see you at a race in a decade.
Pazos:With pleasure. See you.

﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withCourtney Dauwalterafter her win at the 2024Hardrock 100. How are you, Courtney?
Courtney Dauwalter:I’m good, how are you?
iRunFar:Alright, beautiful morning here in the park.
Dauwalter:Oh man, walking over here we were just saying how lucky we are that this weekend has been primo weather for everybody.
iRunFar:Was it for you?
Dauwalter:Yeah. I mean, no thunderstorms. You know, no one had to hunker down and hide from lightning on peaks. But I would say if I was going to get particular, it could have been a little less hot. [laughs]
iRunFar:And it wasn’t crazy hot all of Friday. When when did it kind of impact your performance on Friday? Or your enjoyment.
Dauwalter:I felt it pretty early, yeah. I don’t know why, but from the jump it was just feeling hot and feeling like my body was not reacting to it smoothly. So, start until about Kroger’s was tough for a lot of reasons, but I think the heat was a factor in there.
iRunFar:What were the other reasons? What was going on?
Dauwalter:I don’t know, you know, some days it’s just weird. Like, my heart felt like it wasn’t regulating. My body systems were just kind of like, feeling sluggish, and then the heat was taking its toll. So I was just waiting for systems to join the party so that it could feel like smoother running.
iRunFar:Is that your experience coming through? Because like, you could panic. Like, oh my god, I’m only 10 or 20 miles into Hardrock, and this and that and the other thing aren’t going right.
Dauwalter:Yeah, but what I’ve learned is in these ultras, especially ones like Hardrock that are just tough and long, is you have to keep believing. Even if you’re faking yourself out, and you have to give it time. Because sometimes time is the thing that fixes everything. But also, I had my crew. So, I rolled into Telluride sort of in shambles, really overheating, and that’s about mile 27. And my crew had icy cold things, but also just words of encouragement and belief to keep me moving to the next spot, and to keep giving it that time to fix itself.
iRunFar:So, what were some of those actual things that they had for you in Telluride?
Dauwalter:A lot of cold things, but them not panicking gives it the vibe that like, there’s nothing to panic about, you know? So they were just like, “Yeah, okay, that’s fine. It’s hot out. Let’s cool you down, and then we’ll send you off with like a cold rag on your neck, and I will see you in the next spot.”
iRunFar:Which feels really good in this high elevation, dry air. Especially on a sunny day, that evaporative cooling.
Dauwalter:Oh, so good.
iRunFar:So good.
Dauwalter:Yeah.
iRunFar:Were you dipping at all in streams?
Dauwalter:All of them, yeah. [laughs]
iRunFar:Water levels come down in the San Juans.
Dauwalter:The amount of jealousy I felt when I was climbing up to Grant Swamp Pass and looking down at Island Lake.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Dauwalter:Everyone jumping in. People swimming in it. And I was like, that looks like the day to be having right now. That looks so nice.
iRunFar:So, did you start feeling better on the climb out of Telluride to Kroger’s?
Dauwalter:Yeah, I did start feeling better. It felt like systems came on board a little more. I was able to just self-regulate my heart rate and temperature better. And then Kroger’s is such a beacon of joy to get up there and to roll then down off of it.
iRunFar:Literally sparkly joy this year.
Dauwalter:Yeah. Some power glitter got put on, which was really helpful. And then things started clicking a little bit better headed down into Ouray.
iRunFar:So, if you had heat bother you early in the race, typically toward the front of the pack, the climb out of Ouray is really hot and like, almost oppressive. Did that touch you again coming out of town?
Dauwalter:No, surprisingly I felt really good on that climb. And we had a little breeze coming off the river there, so that helped for sure. But I had a good couple sections then where my head was in a good spot, my body was on board, and I was able to move better.
iRunFar:And it being Hardrock, those couple good sections don’t last.
Dauwalter:Yeah, guaranteed if you’re having a good one, a bad one is coming.
iRunFar:Just wait for it to come. It’s like the weather in Colorado. Wait five minutes. So, when did things turn south again? Because they did.
Dauwalter:Yeah, they for sure turned south again. I guess my good sections were out of Ouray, all the way until Sherman. So, even up and over Handies was great. I got to pick up my pacerMike [Ambrose]at Animas.
iRunFar:You had such a smile when you picked him up.
Dauwalter:Yeah, so pumped. And then when I got to Sherman, my stomach turned, and then we just sort of started the swirl around the drain of like, energy depletion, and yeah, leaving a little trail along the rest of the path.
iRunFar:A vomit slick.
Dauwalter:Yeah.
iRunFar:This way to the next station.
Dauwalter:My apologies. [laughs]
iRunFar:[laughs] Yeah, how did you work through that? Because you can convince yourself early in the race. It’s a little easier maybe that like, all right, I’m going to come around. Things have flipped. The switch has flipped. How do you deal with that again?
Dauwalter:We just kept trying things to see what would stay in. So it was being patient with it. And every time I would throw up, I was with Mike that whole time. I’m sorry, Mike. But we would just say, that’s okay. That’s fine. There was no problems with it. I also have been learning over the years that it doesn’t have to be the end when you get on that. When you climb aboard the vomit train, it doesn’t mean it’s a lost cause to keep pushing forward.
iRunFar:Because that happened to you. You dropped out of Hardrock. I forgot what the exact year it was.
Dauwalter:’21?
iRunFar:Okay. Because you were puking and you ended it.
Dauwalter:Yeah. And like, working with my good friendMeredith Terranova, who’s also a nutritionist, has helped us see that when you’re going through the steps of plan A, B, C, and D, and everything’s failing, there’s still more plans you can keep trying. So, that was running through my head for sure, as I was struggling to keep calories in. But still moving forward as best we could. It was a hard night.
iRunFar:Yeah. But you were still making good time. Things came around. There wasn’t much competition late in the race in the women’s field. You were well ahead. You were well clear. Were you starting to think at all about your previous times here, either in the clockwise direction, or the overall course record? That are both yours.
Dauwalter:So, I picked upKevin [Schmidt]at Cunningham for the last section of the course. And he took me up and over Little Giant. And, if he hadn’t been along, I don’t think I would have even known the times, but he’s a numbers guy. So.
iRunFar:He was well organized.
Dauwalter:Yeah. He was well in tune with the numbers. And when we got to the top of Little Giant, which is a very big climb at the end of the race, we looked at our watches. And I was like, “Do you think the clock could read 25 as the first number? You know, get under 26 hours?” And then we’re looking and we’re like, man, there’s a lot of miles. And I’m not moving that smoothly yet. Probably not. But then he was like, “Yeah, but your other number is, this.” So, we actually were trying then to see if we could get under the previous number. Just to have a carrot, basically.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Dauwalter:It helped to make the end trail section, like, go a little faster, because I was trying really hard to move. Versus, maybe like, just slogging it in, because I was suffering greatly.
iRunFar:And you could. You had a number of hours up on second place there.Is it still exciting when you like, run a time no woman has ever run? Like?
Dauwalter:[laughs] I mean, it’s painful.
iRunFar:You’ve done it three straight years here. [laughs]
Dauwalter:But it’s a cool course. And I know that women can bring that time down even more. So, just to have been part of that has been cool.
iRunFar:Perhaps even someone with the name Courtney.
Dauwalter:[laughs] I don’t know. Maybe I need to come back and volunteer a few years before I’m back on this course.
iRunFar:Well, fair enough. Do you have anything planned coming up for the rest of the summer?
Dauwalter:Kevin is in theLeadville 100. So, I’ll be crewing and pacing him. Hopefully doing the crewing job justice like he always does. And then we’ll see.
iRunFar:Maybe not quite up to Schmidty level, but do the best you can.
Dauwalter:I could never reach Schmidty level of crewing, but yeah, I’ll give it a shot.
iRunFar:And then your season’s probably not done. You’ll probably find something to?
Dauwalter:Yeah. There’s a lot of months left in the year, so. And way too many cool things to do. So we’ll see what happens.
iRunFar:All right. Well, congrats on your run here.
Dauwalter:Thank you.
iRunFar:And I look forward to seeing what you do this summer.
Dauwalter:Thank you.

Dauwalter:I had a hamburger for breakfast, so it’s possible. [laughs]

"Ludovic Pommeret, 2024 Hardrock 100 Champion, Interview",https://www.irunfar.com/ludovic-pommeret-2024-hardrock-100-champion-interview,"In his debutHardrock 100, France’sLudovic Pommeretnot only ran away with a dominant win but also set an overall course record. In the following interview, Ludovic talks about spending miles with other runners early on, how he worried that he may have pushed too hard on the descent off of Kroger’s Canteen and into Ouray, missing the sunset on Handies Peak because he was too fast, and how he refused any information on splits to other racers until near the end of the race so that he could focus on managing his needs.

﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withLudovic Pommeretafter his win at the 2024Hardrock 100. How are you, Ludo?
Ludovic Pommeret:I’m good. I feel good. It’s okay. You know, you’re always feeling good when the race has been a success, that you are proud of the race, and you always recover better.
iRunFar:Yeah. Well, you had an outstanding race. From the beginning, you were in the lead, but for a while you were withFrançois[D’Haene]andDiego [Pazos]. How was the start of the race for you?
Pommeret:Yeah, I was surprised to take the lead just in the first climb. Usually I’m not doing that, but that’s a different race. That was a dream to come in this race. The day started with a dream, just leading the race at the first climb.
iRunFar:Yeah?
Pommeret:It was good to share a bit of trails with François, Diego, andJason [Schlarb].It was nice.
iRunFar:When did you go off on your own?
Pommeret:In downhill mainly, but then François come back in the uphill. And then, really on the uphill to Kroger’s Canteen.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Pommeret:Then François could not reach me during the uphill. Then I have never seen him again.
iRunFar:So, you’re running alone from Kroger’s.
Pommeret:Yeah, from Telluride, in fact.
iRunFar:Yeah? When did you pick up a pacer?
Pommeret:In Ouray.
iRunFar:Okay, so only one stretch that you were entirely alone.
Pommeret:Yeah. I told to my crew, next time I see you, we will play together on the trails.[laughs]
iRunFar:Yeah, so Ouray is almost halfway through the race. How are you feeling when you come into the Ouray checkpoint?
Pommeret:I was not sure that I did the right pacing in downhill, because I was pretty fast for me. It’s not aJim [Walmsley]pace, but for me it was quite fast downhill. So I said maybe I will pay that in the next uphill. But yeah, finally it was good, everything good.
iRunFar:A lot of people talked about, in the front of the race, talked about heat, even very early in the race. Was that a problem for you going up to Grant Swamp Pass, or Oscar’s Pass, or Kroger’s?
Pommeret:No, it was not a problem. It was more that we have to adapt to our nutrition plan. Our nutrition plan was more based on the powder, you know, in the water. And using that, I was too thirsty. So, I had to change a bit, and take water to not have this sugar always in the mouth. And that’s a change that we have to perform. No, it was hot, but that’s nothing compared toWestern [States].
iRunFar:No. You’ve done that.
Pommeret:I think it was only 30 degrees [Celcius] in Ouray.
iRunFar:But at the high elevation, and with the sun, it can feel hotter than 30.
Pommeret:But then, especially from Ouray to Engineer Pass, all the small rivers that you cross, are just like on Western. So, you try to stay wet all the time, except when you reach very high, close to the top that you don’t.
iRunFar:Yeah, and the air here is very dry. It’s not likeDiagonale des Fous.
Pommeret:Yeah.
iRunFar:The air is dry. So if you get wet, the evaporation is quite nice and cooling.
Pommeret:Yeah, yeah. But the temperature was perfect, and weather was perfect. I just have a small rain downhill to Governor, Governor to Ouray. But it was just a small one. And you remove the dust from the road. So no, that was perfect.
iRunFar:So when you adjust your nutrition, you were having some water as well as, I assume, some sports drink. When you took away, when you added the water, did you add other form of nutrition? More gels, more food, what?
Pommeret:Yeah, of course, you have to replace what I was not eating or drinking. So, I replaced with gels and purée, I don’t know.
iRunFar:Yeah, purée.
Pommeret:Purée, yeah.
iRunFar:Like apple?
Pommeret:Yeah, apple and butternut. That’s a Näak product. So yeah, of course, I have to replace. Yeah, my goal for nutrition was to stay around 30 kilocalories per hour.
iRunFar:300, yeah.
Pommeret:Yeah, 300, yes. And so, I think we follow the plan and maybe even more sometime.
iRunFar:That’s incredible. And your stomach throughout the race?
Pommeret:Stomach was okay. I have to stop at the beginning of the race, but not because of stomach issue. That’s, I’d say, usual. [laughs]
iRunFar:It’s a good morning, yes.
Pommeret:And everything was good. And I had a glycemic sensor.
iRunFar:Oh, you had a glycemic sensor. You’re checking your blood sugar.
Pommeret:Yeah. That I analyzed after the race if everything was good. And I stayed in thecorrect range, so the nutrition is good.
iRunFar:That’s incredible because that’s a huge challenge from the front to the back of the pack at Hardrock, being at high elevation for so long.
Pommeret:Yeah, that was something that I didn’t know if my body will support the nutrition. Because we have a plan, but it’s different, and you react maybe different with elevation. So, that’s something that you cannot really plan. And during the training, I have not the same nutrition. I take, of course, less than in the race. So, that was an unknown part.
iRunFar:So, you get over, you make the climb out of Ouray to Engineer Pass. You were all alone. Do you know how much of a gap you have on the next?
Pommeret:No, because from Telluride, I asked my crew and my pacers to not give me any race info on the other runners. I wanted to stay focused on my race, on my feeling. And I asked them to shut up.
iRunFar:[laughs]
Pommeret:And they didn’t give me any info until Cunningham.
iRunFar:And your climb over Handies Peak, how was that?
Pommeret:Yeah, it’s okay. This side, I think I prefer than the other one because, you know, it’s split. You have a first uphill, then a bit rest. It’s downhill. And the second step, second climb. So, it was okay. And I was better feeling than on the Softrock.
iRunFar:Yeah. And I was going to ask how the view was from the top of Handies, but you tell me at the finish or on the course, you weren’t taking in the views.
Pommeret:No.
iRunFar:Because you did two Softrocks. Did you see the sunset at Handies Peak?
Pommeret:No, because I was much more in advance for sunset. So, that was the expectation to have sunset at Handies. But finally, I had to switch on the light after Sherman. So, it was no sunset. But yeah, it was nice to do the downhill from Handies Peak during the day.
iRunFar:It’s much easier.
Pommeret:It’s easier.
iRunFar:So, I know you said you weren’t getting any race information from your crew, but you’re arriving at checkpoints or at the top of Handies Peak much earlier than you were planning.
Pommeret:Yeah, yeah. [laughs]
iRunFar:So, you’re starting to think, I’m running a very fast time.
Pommeret:Yeah, but I stopped to read my watch also. So, I know that I saw the sun. It was not too low. So, I said, for sure, I’m in advance on my planning, but I didn’t know how many.
iRunFar:Was that scary, exciting?
Pommeret:Exciting, but I was just focused on my pace and try to find, you know, it’s always difficult to find the right pace. You don’t know if you are going too fast or if you can do better. And so, I was just listening to my body and try.
iRunFar:So, how are you motivating yourself at this time? Again, it’s only you and your pace, or you haven’t seen another runner in 50 or 60 miles. What is the motivation?
Pommeret:You know, it’s really difficult to get a bib here. So, motivation is first to finish the loop, kiss the rock. I learned that you have to kiss the rock before you stop the timing. [laughs] So, that was the main motivation. And just to listen to your body and not the other one. That was enough for me. I called my coach just before the race. Six minutes before the race, I was still with my coach. And he told me, just try to do your race and don’t take care about others. And it’s what I have done. And even if I knew that there was nobody behind, because when you are in the dark, near Cataract, you do a bit of a run and you see that on all the valley, there’s no light. So, I knew that there was some margin.
iRunFar:So, now you’re far into the race. You’re 120 kilometers. Things are still going completely fine?
Pommeret:Yeah. That was surprising because I say the beginning of the race was a dream. Iwas always thinking, when will be the nightmare? When will start the nightmare? But no.
iRunFar:No.
Pommeret:Never.
iRunFar:No problems.
Pommeret:No problems. When I wanted to run, I run. I run. And it was a perfect day. I don’t know. It has never happened to me before that.
iRunFar:This was your most perfect race?
Pommeret:Yeah. Yeah. Everything, all planets aligned.
iRunFar:You can’t compare it to when you wonUTMB, but that was not aperfect race.
Pommeret:No, no, for sure. That was,
iRunFar:A disaster.
Pommeret:Yeah. [laughs]
iRunFar:That was a nightmare first and then a dream.
Pommeret:Yes, exactly.
iRunFar:So, you said earlier, that you had no information about the other racers, about your time, until Cunningham. And what do you learn at Cunningham?
Pommeret:So, just my wife say, may I tell you something? I say, okay, now Cunningham, I can. So, she told me you are around 20 minutes ahead of the course record. So, now you have to push to get this record. So, we just stopped at the aid station. I drink some soup. There’s some Näak soup that are pretty good during the night, especially when it’s cold. And then I decided, okay, we’ll try. I knew thatKilian [Jornet]pushed really hard at the end.
iRunFar:I was going to ask you that because it’s really important.
Pommeret:I say it will be really tough because I remember, because I have done that on the Softrock, and I have done also training from Maggie’s to Silverton, in addition of the Softrock. So, I knew that the uphill from Kilian was 46 minutes, I think. I say, I can never reach this timing. So, I will for sure lose some minutes in the uphill. Finally, I did 52, I think. So, that was good.
iRunFar:So, 14 minutes now.
Pommeret:So, yeah. And then downhill, it was much more difficult during the race because it was dark. So, the light. It’s a road, but it’s rocky road, and you have to find the right path.
iRunFar:Every step, you must be watching.
Pommeret:Yeah. So, it’s quite difficult. And it was also a risk to not be injured in trying to go fast in the last descent. So, that’s it.
iRunFar:Even the three or five kilometers on the flat trail into town.
Pommeret:Yeah, horrible. It’s not flat at all. [laughs]
iRunFar:Not easy.
Pommeret:There’s three uphill that are really short, but there’s one that seems to be as long as a [Little] Giant Pass.
iRunFar:It might be one minute, but it feels like 50.
Pommeret:Yes.
iRunFar:And you’re coming into the finish, and you’re just, the whole way through town, you’re just pushing, pushing, pushing.
Pommeret:Yeah, pushing. I arrived at the old rocks, you know, at the bottom of the lift, and I knew that it’s around one kilometer, a bit more. And I have eight minutes more. So, I will do it, but I will continue to push. And it was, let’s say, aZach [Miller]finish. Inspiration from Zach, always finishing as fast as possible. [laughs]
iRunFar:And then you did, and then you vomit. [laughs]
Pommeret:Yeah. The finish was not smooth. No, it’s not smooth.
iRunFar:No, it’s smooth, you pushed it the whole way. And that was the first time you were sick the entire race. Yes?
Pommeret:Yeah. Only at the finish, when you stop, and then your body, yeah.
iRunFar:And so, what are your thoughts on that accomplishment? Is it your best race ever, or?
Pommeret:Yeah, I think the best, yeah. Because everything run fine, so yeah. For sure, it’s the best race.
iRunFar:Do you think you’d come back here?
Pommeret:[laughs] You know, you take a long time to get a bib here, so I don’t know if you can refuse a bib. But yeah, we’ll see. We have to discuss.
iRunFar:It’s not no.
Pommeret:It’s not no.
iRunFar:I’m sensing a maybe, probably.
Pommeret:So, is it true that to be a real Hardrocker, you have to do both sides?
iRunFar:Yes, if you want to be a Hardrocker.
Pommeret:We’ll see, we’ll see.
iRunFar:So, it’s been discussed a lot. You’re 48. You’re going to turn 49 this week?
Pommeret:Yeah, in eight days.
iRunFar:Okay, eight days. I want to say it’s an inspiration, but it also tells me I have no excuses. I’m 46.
Pommeret:It’s still young, it’s okay.
iRunFar:I still want to run Hardrock again. I’m thinking, as many people do in their mid-40s, I’m never going to be able to run as fast as I did before. I’ve got to lower my expectations.
Pommeret:That’s probably true on short distance, but that’s different on long distance, I think.
iRunFar:You hold all of us in our 40s accountable.
Pommeret:It’s good. That experience is also something that serves you for the race.
iRunFar:Yeah, I talked to Jason Schlarb a little bit after the race about how, you know, he’s 46, you’re 48. The level in the last 10 years has, in all of ultrarunning, has gone up. Not just a little, a lot. There’s a lot of younger people being competitive, people in their 20s, their 30s.
Pommeret:And especially the density on the race is increasing. We have seen on Western also that three are under 14:30.
iRunFar:But especially at, they’re all hard, but the harder, more mountainous races, with a lot of other factors, you can still win. You can still set course records.
Pommeret:It seems.
iRunFar:You’ve been doing this for a very long time. Is it 20 years since your first UTMB?
Pommeret:Yeah, this year, 20 years. Yeah.
iRunFar:What has changed with your body? Have you found some things have improved? Is recovery easy? What’s changed for you?
Pommeret:I think the body changed, for sure. When I started running, I think my body was not ready. You know, the body has to learn also, and keep only the right fiber, you say?
iRunFar:Yeah.
Pommeret:In your legs. So, I think for, especially for ultra, your body is adapting and the experience on the past race. The Western States experience, it was great also for me, because I learned that you could run quite fast, and still could hike and you can run for a long time. And that was not what I prefer. I prefer to hike, in fact. I’m not a real runner, I never learn how to run, so.
iRunFar:Yeah. And what is your marathon PR? Your best?
Pommeret:Just before Western, I did 2:31.
iRunFar:Which is good, but it’s also… So that’s just so cool. You know, you learn, your body improves, the muscle fibers, so you can maybe train more or train longer and not have injury. Do you think your energy systems have adapted? Like, your ability to continue to eat and to continue to process fuel?
Pommeret:This I’m not sure, but I try to continue experience on my body, how I should train, because, I think that we don’t have the perfect training for the long distance. So, I’m still experimenting on myself. You know, the high volume, usually I do it a bit earlier. Now I finish my volume only two weeks before the start. That’s a change, yeah. I did a quite strong training, it was short, it was climbing to the Island Lake. And we finished quite fast with my pacers.
iRunFar:When?
Pommeret:Full speed, three days before. And we were really exhausted at the top.
iRunFar:What was the inspiration for that? Because that’s not, that would not have been the norm, like 10 years ago. You’d give three weeks taper or something.
Pommeret:I was playing with my pacer and that’s it. We start, you know, it’s…
iRunFar:Not a strategy.
Pommeret:No, no.
iRunFar:The coach was like, no, no.
Pommeret:No, the coach was, okay, I did two hours. It was 1:15. But no, there was nothing planned for this training. So just, you have to continue and see what is working for you. And there’s no universal training.
iRunFar:And you learn what’s better for you over time. Each year, maybe.
Pommeret:Maybe, but what worked one day could not work the day after.
iRunFar:And mentally, I’m sure you’ve grown a ton over 20 years.
Pommeret:Yes, for sure, but I think I have not learned so much on this race because it was so smooth. That’s not something, as I said toCourtney [Dauwalter], I have no pain cave on this race, so I didn’t learn. But I learned a lot on other races.
iRunFar:So it’s the problems and the challenges when you learn. It’s not when everything goes well.
Pommeret:Yeah, of course, we say often that you learn more when you lose than when you win, but yeah, I prefer win. [laughs]
Pommeret:And win you did. Congratulations on your win, Ludo.
Pommeret:Thanks.
iRunFar:And good luck at UTMB!
Pommeret:Yeah, thanks.
iRunFar:Maybe go for another win?
Pommeret:No, I’m not expecting that, but.
iRunFar:Give your best.
Pommeret:Yeah, thanks.
iRunFar:Congratulations.

2024 Hardrock 100 Results: Pommeret and Dauwalter Break Course Records and Claim Commanding Wins,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-hardrock-100-results,"
It was,Ludovic Pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) said, a dream when he kissed the rock at the end of the 2024Hardrock 100. He finished his lap around the San Juan Mountains of Colorado with a new overall course record of 21:33:06, breakingKilian Jornet’sprevious record, set in 2022, by just over three minutes. Pommeret, a 48-year-old Frenchman, led almost wire-to-wire in a commanding fashion.
“I dream all the day,” Pommeret said at the iconic rock-kissing finish just past 3:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, July 13, 2024. “The nightmare never came.”
Neither did it come for the women’s winnerCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who seems to redefine what is possible in ultrarunning every time she toes the line. Dauwalter won the women’s race in 26:11:49, setting a new overall women’s course record, breaking her own mark of 26:14:12set last yearas the second race ofher historic Western States 100-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple. That means Dauwalter, who also led essentially wire-to-wire, has set a course record the past three times she’s run and owns the fastest three women’s times.

But before the two champions got back to the rock, there was a lot of running to do. At 6 a.m. local time on Friday, July 12, 146 runners set off in the predawn darkness under the watchful gaze of the San Juan Mountains in Silverton, Colorado, to begin one of the most famous, arduous, andscenically stunning100-mile races in the world.
The Hardrock 100, famous for itsdifficultyandselectiveness, is a 102.5-mile trek featuring more than 33,000 feet of elevation gain and an average elevation of 11,000 feet through the rugged San Juans. It alternates directions every year, and this year’s race went clockwise. Starting in the smallminingtown of Silverton, runners made their way to Telluride before continuing on to Ouray and near Lake City and then returned to Silverton to kiss the iconic rock. The course, often impacted by snow, was mostly snow-free this year, and temperatures vacillated between sub-40 degrees and 80 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day and night.
“It’s 100 miles. It’s huge mountains. It’s altitude,” Dauwalter said in her pre-race interview with iRunFar. “So, adventure is guaranteed for sure.”

Entering the race, it was fair to wonder what droveCourtney Dauwalter(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) to return to the event again. Over the past two years, she’d won twice and set course records in both directions. But she was back, she said during her pre-race interview with iRunFar, because she still felt that she had left something on the course.
“I am back because all of my runs here have had just really significant chunks of time that were spent in very low places,” she said. “I would love to try to smooth out those lows just a little bit, and see if I can get around that course without having so many huge hours.” And while she struggled with stomach issues for some of the second half of the run, she still reset the overall course record, breaking her previous clockwise record by more than 30 minutes.
Dauwalter, whowon the Transgrancanaria 126kand the Mt. Fuji 100 Mile already this year, is so consistently dominant that her wins in major ultras can seem like a foregone conclusion. But Hardrock is never easy, and she still had to cover the 100-plus miles and 33,000-plus feet of elevation gain. Once again, she did it faster than any woman ever had before her, including herself.

France’sCamille Bruyas(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) and Germany’sKatharina Hartmuth(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) posed the biggest challenges to Dauwalter. Both had finished second by Dauwalter at UTMB in 2021 and 2023, respectively, and both had spent the last few weeks in the U.S. acclimating to the high elevations and learning the terrain. While Dauwalter had opened a small gap on Bruyas at the Kamm Traverse aid station (mile 11) and maintained it through Chapman at mile 18, by Telluride at mile 28, Bruyas had closed the gap and came through in the co-lead with Dauwalter, two minutes under course record pace.
Dauwalter slowly began to pull away — five minutes up at Kroger’s Canteen at mile 33 and six minutes by Ouray at mile 44 — before making a strong move to increase her lead over Bruyas to 31 minutes by mile 52. At that point, just over halfway, it was Dauwalter, followed by Bruyas, Hartmuth,Tara Dower(pre-race interview), and France’sClaire Bannwarthrounding out the top five.

From there, Dauwalter continued to run alone. Smiling and moving swiftly in a bright yellow shirt, she was 18 minutes under course-record pace by Animas Forks aid station at mile 58, making quick work of the aid station and picking up her pacer.
One of the few signs of fatigue she showed all race was at the Sherman aid station at mile 73, after climbing and descending from Handies Peak, the course’s high point at 14,058 feet. She stayed for five minutes to rest and refuel before running on into the dark. By Maggie Gulch at mile 87, she was nearly an hour under course-record pace and looked strong. Six miles later, at Cunningham Gulch, she picked up her husband as her pacer as they made their way up and over the final climb.
Less than three hours later and now in the early-morning sun, Dauwalter returned to the rock, and kissed it once more.
Behind her, Hartmuth, who was nursing a bruised sacrum from a fall three weeks prior, had closed the gap on Bruyas during the mid-race miles to as little as 13 minutes by Sherman at mile 73. Eye issues slowed Hartmuth later in the race, causing blurry vision and slow movement, and Bruyas doubled her lead by Pole Creek at mile 81. Bruyas took an 18-minute stop at the Maggie Gulch aid station at mile 87 to refuel and get warm, while Hartmuth, who was also feeling the miles, also took an extended break.

Camille Bruyas battled through the rest of the race to finish second in 29:28:11, and Hartmuth, after a long stop at Cunningham Gulch (mile 93) to get warm under a blanket and deal with her deteriorating vision, finished third in 30:29:12.
The race for the top five behind them was perhaps the closest of the day. After saying she had thrown up eight times, Dower, just three years into her ultrarunning career, battled to catch up to Bannwarth by Maggie Gulch at mile 87. Bannwarth, who was visibly struggling, fell off the pace, while Dower flew along in pursuit of a spot in the top five.

By Cunningham Gulch at mile 93, the three women in contention for positions three through five —Yitka Winn,Emily Halnon, and Dower — were separated by only 16 minutes. All three made short stops at the aid station before continuing.
Between Cunningham Gulch and the final descent at mile 97, Halnon made a move. She passed Winn to move into fourth place, making up more than 20 minutes in less than six miles. Dower, meanwhile, put in a huge move of her own on the rocky final descent and also passed Winn, with the gap growing visibly in a very short distance.
Therein, perhaps, lies the beauty of Hardrock and ultras in general: After almost 100 miles of racing, the battle for the top five came down to two moves made on the final descent and the final rolling miles into the streets of Silverton. In the end, Tara Dower held onto fourth in 33:10:55, Yitka Winn finished fifth in 33:17:00, and Emily Halnon came in looking absolutely ecstatic in sixth with a time of 33:24:22.

The first significant news in the men’s field came a week before the race began. AmericanZach Miller, who wassecond in last year’s UTMBand had put ina monster training blockin preparation for Hardrock, was among the favorites, but did not race following an emergency appendectomy on July 5. Ever the optimist and making the most of a disappointing situation, Miller spent part of Saturday morningmaking his patented donuts for fans.
Along with Miller, France’sFrançois D’Haene(pre-race interview) was expected to contend for the win, even if he had been coming back from injury and not feeling 100% leading up to race day due to an illness a few weeks ahead of time. D’Haene, one of the best runners in the world at long mountainous ultras, set the counter-clockwise course record for the win in 2021 before placing second behindKilian Jornetin 2022 in the clockwise direction. Entering the race, D’Haene had two of the fastest three times in race history.

And whileLudovic Pommeret(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) was certainly expected to be among the top contenders this year, it’s probably fair to say he was not the favorite. But once the race began, the Frenchman made his intentions clear.
Pommeret, who was running his first full Hardrock after pacing for last year’s winnerAurélien Dunand-Pallaz, arrived in Silverton on June 14 and completed two laps of the course as multi-day trips, otherwise known as Softrocks, as part of a month-long training block to acclimatize to the altitude and mountains. That fitness and preparation were clear from the moment the race began when Pommeret led a pack of runners, including D’Haene,Jason Schlarb(post-race interview), and Switzerland’sDiego Pazos(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) through the Rainbow Trail at mile 1.5.

At Kamm Traverse (mile 11), Pommeret, D’Haene, and Pazos all came through in the lead together. By mile 28, when Pommeret entered Telluride in 5:34 elapsed, he was two minutes below course-record pace, with D’Haene 2.5 minutes behind him.
Then began the famous 4,300-foot ascent to Kroger’s Canteen aid station, which sits at 13,100 feet above sea level at mile 33. Pommeret came through in the lead again, smiling and drinking Coke before leaving after only a minute. D’Haene was still close behind, and Schlarb — whotied Jornet for the win at Hardrockin 2016 and has been recovering from a torn ACL from a skiing accident two years ago — came through in third, 32 minutes off the lead. “It’s hard to feel good up here,” Schlarb said, drinking only water and leaving quickly. Pazos, who has several strong finishes at UTMB, came across the iconic pass four minutes behind Schlarb.

It was on the descent to Ouray that Pommeret began to open up a gap. By Ouray (mile 44), the gap to D’Haene, who began to show signs of fatigue on a hot, humid section of the course, was 23 minutes. It was a stark contrast to Pommeret, who looked as smooth as ever. At just over the halfway mark (mile 52), the top four men were Pommeret, D’Haene at 62 minutes off the lead, Schlarb just two minutes behind him, and Pazos a further 11 minutes back.
By Animas Forks at mile 58, Pommeret had increased his lead to 1 hour and 24 minutes, and Schlarb, despite puking, and Pazos had passed D’Haene, who was sadly in tears at the aid station. D’Haene dropped from the race soon after, saying, “You don’t know if you don’t play.” He was clearly still feeling the after-effects of an illness just 10 days prior.
Pommeret continued cruising. He looked smooth and efficient at the next several aid stations, refueling quickly before continuing his record day. At the Sherman aid station at mile 73, now 22 minutes ahead of course-record pace, Pommeret was animated and sprinted away after a three-minute stop, less than 20 miles from history.
Almost exactly seven hours later — after three more characteristically short stops at the remaining aid stations — Pommeret made history, running the final few steps in the cold dark before hugging the rock that had awaited him for the past 21-plus hours. He was officially a Hardrock champion and course-record holder.
Pommeret’s win is a testament to his longevity: He ran his first UTMB 20 years ago,won it in 2016, and now, eight years later, has won Hardrock. Both D’Haene and Miller were at the finish line to congratulate the new champion.
After D’Haene dropped, the battle for second was between Schlarb and Pazos. Schlarb was in front by 13 minutes at mile 62.5, but Pazos looked determined to reel him in. By Sherman at mile 73, Schlarb reported that he had been cramping for most of the race, while Pazos, who quietly devoured a cup of noodles, had cut into his lead.

Fourteen miles later at Maggie Gulch (mile 87), Pazos still looked strong and had passed Schlarb, who said he was battling nausea and getting in his nutrition. Pazos had turned a nine-minute deficit into a six-minute lead. That order would remain until the finish, with Diego Pazos taking second in 24:39:33 and Jason Schlarb coming in third in 24:48:13.
Jeff Rome, thesecond-place finisher in 2018who lives just blocks away from the start of the race and was quoting J.R.R. Tolkien at aid stations, ran an extremely consistent second half of the race to claim fourth, whileBrian Petersontook fifth after emerging from a crowded back half of the men’s top 10 over the last 25 miles. His time was 29:36:04.

2024 Hardrock 100 Preview,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-hardrock-100-preview,"The 2024Hardrock 100kicks off on Friday, July 12, with the 146 lucky runners having 48 hours to complete the mountainous loop through Colorado’s San Juan Mountains.
Starting in the tiny village of Silverton, the route alternates direction every year and, this year, is headed clockwise toward Telluride, onward to Ouray, and toward Lake City, before returning to Silverton. Along the way, the runners will climb more than 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) at an average elevation of roughly 11,000 feet (3,350 meters) and a high point of 14,058 feet (4,284 meters). The course currently traverses 102.5 miles.
With the possible exception of small sections, the course should be relatively snow-free on race day. An around-average snowpack over the winter and a wet start to the summer should mean plenty of water will be found along the course.

This year’s women’s field will be headlined byCourtney Dauwalter, who owns the women’s course record in both of the course’s directions. Her biggest competition for the win will come from Europe in the form of Germany’sKatharina Hartmuthand France’sCamille Bruyas, both of whom have finished second behind Dauwalter at UTMB within the past three years.
As with the women, there’s a favorite on the men’s side inFrançois D’Haene, as the Frenchman has run two of the three fastest times in Hardrock history in his two runnings of the race.However, you can never count outZach Miller, especially as last year, when he placed second at UTMB, he ran it faster than D’Haene ever has.Then there’sLudovic Pommeretof France, who surprised so many with his win at UTMB in 2016 but now would surprise no one with yet another top finish.
Both clockwise course records were set in 2022, the last time the race was run in this year’s direction, when Dauwalter ran 26:44:36 andKilian Jornetran 21:36:24. Jornet’s time remains the men’s overall race record while Dauwalter bettered her overall women’s mark in running 26:14:12 last year in the counterclockwise direction.
Ahead of the race, we’ll publish interviews with some of the race favorites and, of course, we’ll be covering the race live starting at 6 a.m. U.S. MDT on Friday, July 12. Enjoy!

Courtney Dauwalter
WithCourtney Dauwalter(pre-race interview) back in the race, it seems hers to lose. It’s tough to condense her long list of laurels and laudits, but here goes. Here at Hardrock,Dauwalter set the clockwise course record two years ago by running 26:44and, then,set the counterclockwise course record of 26:14 last year. Or, looking at last year another way,she set course records at the Western States 100and Hardrock 100, andwon UTMB, all in the span of two months. That’s got to be in consideration for the best women’s trail ultrarunning season ever. This year, Dauwalter’s already won Transgrancanaria and the Mt. Fuji 100 Mile. But, as always, there’s a reason they run the race!
Katharina Hartmuth
Germany’sKatharina Hartmuth(pre-race interview) is high on the short list of women in the world who can run close to Dauwalter at such events. Last year,she was second to Dauwalter by 40 minutes at UTMB. That was part of Hartmuth’s stellar 2023 campaign in which she also took fourth at Transgrancanaria,placed second at the Trail Running World Championships – Long Trailin Austria, and won the Eiger Ultra-Trail 100k. A year earlier, the German also won the Eiger Ultra-Trail 100k and took third at TDS. So far this year, Hartmuth was seventh at Transvulcania and recently won the Trail 100 Andorra by a large margin. Hartmuth arrived to Silverton with about three weeks to acclimate to the high altitude, but has said on social media that she’s carefully nursing an injury at the moment.
Camille Bruyas
Like Hartmuth, France’sCamille Bruyas(pre-race interview) hastaken second behind Dauwalter at UTMB, having done so back in 2021. In the past couple years, she’s taken 10th at the 2022 Western States 100, won the 2022 Les Templiers and 2022 Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k, and been second at the 2023 Diagonale des Fous. So far this year, Bruyas has won the Penyagolosa CSP 106k and the Volvic Volcanic Experience 110k relay. Like Hartmuth, Bruyas would benefit greatly from a few weeks of acclimation ahead of Hardrock, where Dauwalter has the advantage of living at 10,200 feet (over 3,000 meters). Indeed, Bruyas will have spent three weeks in the U.S. before race day.
Claire Bannwarth
Having taken fifth at least year’s Hardrock, France’sClaire Bannwarthis the second-highest woman’s finisher returning from last year’s field after Dauwalter. Bannwarth is a racing fiend, pinning on a number at seemingly as many and as long of races as she can find. Looking at only her 11 results listed on UTMB.World from 2023, she raced 1,612 miles. Among those finishes were a win at the Winter Spine Race, a seventh at Transgrancanaria, and overall win at the Tahoe 200 Mile, and a 16th at UTMB. As of mid-June 2024, she’s already raced at least 1,017 miles this year, again winning the Winter Spine Race, taking third at the Istria 100 Mile, placing fourth at the Madeira Island Ultra-Trail, and taking second at the Tahoe 200 Mile.
It appears that coastal Virginia’sTara Dower(pre-race interview) is toeing the line at Hardrock barely three years into her ultrarunning journey, but don’t let that short ultra career fool you. Dower has finished at least eight 100-mile races in that time, including taking second at the Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile in 2022 before winning in 2023. Already this year, she’s been seventh at the Black Canyon 100k and won the Umstead 100 Mile outright in 14:58. She finished last year with a fourth-place, 6:51 run at the JFK 50 Mile. Last year, Dower also set a then women’s supported FKT on the Colorado Trail, so she’s familiar with the high alpine terrain of the San Juan Mountains.
Canada’sClaire Heslopmust use ultrarunning as a reason to travel the world, as her results page seemingly has more flags than the United Nations. One spot she does keep returning to is UTMB, where she’s finished 18th, 19th, and, then, 11th over the past three years, improving her times from 32:12 to 30:38 to 28:05 along the way. Heslop was third at Penyagolosa CSP 106k in 2022 and 14th at Transgrancanaria last year. Earlier this year, she was third at the Tenerife Bluetrail 110k.
When I think ofYitka Winn, I first think of her stint as an associate editor at “Trail Runner Magazine” —andwriting a piece for iRunFar— a decade ago. However, she’s become quite the runner, winning the Cascade Crest 100 Mile in 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2023. Last year, she also took 10th at the Gorge Waterfalls 100k and third at the Orcas Island 50k. While she’s not run a big-mountain 100 miler in a while, she has experience in them, as well as in racing in the San Juan Mountains.
[Update, July 9:Maggie Guterlannounced on social media that she’ll have to miss this year’s due to a compensation injury from her two-year struggle with Achilles tendon issues.]From just down the hill in Durango,Maggie Guterlis back in this year’s Hardrock, having taken 11th in 2022. Guterl is perhaps best known for winning the 2019 Big Dog’s Backyard Ultra and the 2021 Cocodona 250 Mile. While she’s struggled with long events at high altitude in the past and battles an Achilles injury, she’ll have spent as much time on the course this year as any woman you can expect to see toward the front of the race. She was also eighth at the 2022 Run Rabbit Run 100 Mile.

Notable Withdrawals

François D’Haene
It’s hard to bet against recent success at Hardrock. That’s why France’sFrançois D’Haene(pre-race interview) is likely the favorite heading into this year’s Hardrock 100. D’Haene is easily among the top three men at long, mountainous ultras over the past decade with wins at UTMB, Diagonale des Fous, Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji, Madeira Island Ultra-Trail (MIUT), and many more. Up here in Colorado’s San Juan Mountains, D’Haenewon the 2021 Hardrock in a counterclockwise course record of 21:45before being edged out by Kilian Jornet totake second in 2022 in 21:51. That gives the Frenchman two of the three fastest times at Hardrock. He doesn’t yet have is a win in the clockwise direction, which the course will be run this year. D’Haene was eighth at Diagonale des Fous last autumn and fifth at the Trail 100 Andorra in mid-June of this year.
Zach Miller
[Update, July 11:Zach Millerwon’t be running this year’s Hardrock following appendix-removal surgery on July 5. We wish him a swift recovery.]While D’Haene may have two spectacular finishes in the San Juans,Zach Miller’sspent plenty of time in these mountains over the years. After a couple of years of battling injuries, he bounced back into long-distance form in 2023, winning the Tarawera 100 Mile, taking sixth Trail Running World Championships – Long Trail in Austria, and, then,taking second to Jim Walmsley at UTMB. Back in February, Miller took seventh at Transgrancanaria. No doubt, Miller and his bus will have been stationed high in the Colorado Rockies well ahead of race day.
Ludovic Pommeret
I’m excited that France’sLudovic Pommeret(pre-race interview) will have spent nearly a month in Silverton before this year’s Hardrock. It’s hard not to root for a guy who’s quickly approaching 50 years old and is still on top of his game. These days, UTMB is easily the most competitive trail ultramarathon on the planet. In 2021, Ludo took fourth there, and, last year, he placed fifth. In between, he won TDS in 2022. Oh, and he won Diagonale des Fous in 2021.
Diego Pazos
Before diving into his results, I was tempted to say that Switzerland’sDiego Pazos(pre-race interview) has slowed a bit in recent years, but that’s not the case! Looking back at his UTMB finishes, he was 11th in 2014 in 23:11, seventh in 23:00 in 2021, and 24th in 23:17 in 2023, with the two latter races being on longer, slower courses than that from 2014. So, I think we can confirm that Pazos has one high-quality chronometer!
Jason Schlarb
Based in Durango, Colorado,Jason Schlarbtied with Kilian Jornet for the win at the 2016 Hardrock 100before DNFing the following year. However, he blew his ACL skiing in February 2021, and while able to fully train again, his running hasn’t reached the levels from before the injury. Back in 2022, Schlarb was eighth at the Eiger Ultra-Trail and 51st at UTMB in 25:30. So far this year, he’s been 22nd at MIUT and won a local 50k.
Jeff Rome
Although he lives all of two blocks away from the start of Hardrock, Silverton’s ownJeff Romeremains a complete wildcard for this year’s race. Before he moved to town, he was seventh man in 2017 before moving up totake second in 26:34 in 2018. More of an adventurer than a racer, Rome did run well at last year’s nearby San Juan Solstice 50 Mile before taking 13th at the IMTUF 100 Mile in September. If he’s caught another case of Hardrock fever, he could once again surprise a lot of people.
Solidly in the Steady Eddy camp, I’ll be surprised if Colorado’sPaul Terranova(pre-race interview) doesn’t at least match his sixth-place men’s finish from last year’s Hardrock. Indeed, he’s the top returning man from last year’s event. Terranova ran Hardrock last year as part of the Rocky Mountain Slam, in which he also finished sixth at the Leadville 100 Mile, fourth at the Wasatch Front 100 Mile, and ninth at the Bear 100 Mile. In 2022, he was fourth at the Bighorn 100 Mile.

In this interview, Hayden talks about how being fresh and rested after limited training ahead of the race may have helped him, how running with his friends as competitors helps to elevate his performance, his late race sprint finish with second-placeRod Farvard, and where this race sits in the growth of trail ultrarunning competitiveness.
For more on how the race played out, read our in-depth 2024Western States 100 resultsarticle.
﻿﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m withHayden Hawks.It’s the day after the 2024Western States Endurance Run.Congratulations on your third-place finish.
Hayden Hawks:Thank you. I feel really happy about it, especially not knowing if I was going to be here a few weeks ago and, to be able to come out with a podium finish, couldn’t ask for anything more.
iRunFar:So to backtrack just a teensy bit. You had a great race atBlack Canyon 100kin February, but I learned recently you got injured after that. What happened?
Hawks:Yeah, I strained my calf pretty bad after Black Canyon and that led to some compensation injuries. So yeah, I had to take off a significant period of time, I was trying to train but it was not happening. Probably like six to eight weeks. And I think it was 10 weeks ago, I finally started feeling somewhat healthy. But I knew that I would have to have like two weeks of buildup and then maybe have an eight-week training block. And I talked to my coach about it said, “You think we can do it? You think we can get fit enough to at least, you know, compete?” And he’s like, “Yeah, I think we can.” And we did the best we could. It was a very compact block. But I was able to do what I needed to do to get a podium yesterday.
iRunFar:You said in your pre-race interview that there is something that you’re learning through time and with more experience in ultrarunning that you just don’t need the crazy volume, or just the grinding super hard workouts every day. I feel like this performance is a categorical example of practicing what you preach there, right?
Hawks:Yeah, I think Black Canyon was the first example of that, that I didn’t need as much, maybe as long of a block of training as I thought I did. I would have liked a little bit more. I would have liked some base, because I felt like I was just rushing to get fitness, and to be able to have a little bit of base would have been nice. But I think during that base phase, I could have just kept it really easy. While in the past I was doing these long 16-20 week training blocks of just pretty good intensity. Like workouts, big long runs, different things like that. And now I’m realizing that I can just kind of maintain during these periods of time, build some base, and then actually have an 8-10 week block and that’s really all I need. And I come into the race fresh, healthy, ready to go.
iRunFar:So let’s talk a little bit about how yesterday went. It was, from the outside looking in, just continuously dynamic start to finish. Is that how it also felt to be in the race?
Hawks:Yeah, it was crazy. I mean, it was awesome to see this whole race going on, because I think me andJim [Walmsley]were just talking about this. It’s like we’ve never had that many people so close together.
iRunFar:So late in the race.
Hawks:Yeah, so late in the race. And I think it was at Devil’s Thumb I remember me and Jim were at the top of the climb, and I looked down, and there were like six of us on the climb. And I’ve never seen that many people at once on that climb. And then I went into I think it was Michigan Bluff or Foresthill. And there was a part where I felt like the race was maybe getting away from me. But then I went in and they were like, there’s six guys within five minutes of each other. And I was like, “Really?”
iRunFar:The race has not gone on at all.
Hawks:No, we’re still only halfway. You know, there’s plenty of movement that can still go on and so I just kept fighting, kept positive kept, staying on top of everything I needed to. And I started catching some people and it worked out pretty well.
iRunFar:You said off camera that your low patch came sort of in the vicinity of like Michigan Bluff, Foresthill, and then you were able to get yourself back together after that. Could you walk us through that part?
Hawks:Yeah, actually a little before that, like Devil’s Thumb. Me, Jim, andDan Joneswent down together into Devil’s Thumb. And then we were climbing up and Jim put in a big push, I thinkDakota [Jones]had caught us at the bottom of the climb too, or the bottom the descent. And he put up a pretty big push in. And I was like, you know, I can climb with Jim.
iRunFar:Sure.Hawks:I’ve trained with him before and I can do this, but I think my climbing hasn’t been quite where it needs to be, just
because maybe I didn’t have as long of a block, or the training I needed to. But I went with Jim, but then he broke me near the top. And I felt like I maybe pushed a little too hard. Because the descent going down into El Dorado, I was I feeling it pretty good. But Dakota andRod Farvardpassed me going down into El Dorado and they were like, “Are you okay?” And I said, “Yeah, I’m just trying to regroup.” I just needed some time to regroup. I think that was smart. Like the past me maybe would have tried to push that. But I just kind of regrouped, refueled, and started feeling good coming out of El Dorado and then just kept progressing after that.iRunFar:You said that somewhere in one of those two sort
of bigger aid stations, you felt like oh, is the race getting away from me? But then there’s a bunch of guys there, and it occurred to you the race is right around you. Did it feel like, I don’t know, going down Cal Street, at the river,  did you feel like. okay, I’m back at it now? I’m here to race.
Hawks:Yeah. I started feeling really good coming down Cal Street. I had an amazing crew stop at Foresthill. Things went really well. I was able to take care of myself like I needed to. And I start feeling really good. And I saw Dan was pretty close behind me. I could see him. I knewJon Albonwas really close, too. And I’ve raced Jon before. He’s an incredible descender. So I was a little nervous.
iRunFar:What’s going to happen?
Hawks:Jon’s probably going to catch me on this downhill.
iRunFar:You have your training partner behind you. Jon Albon behind you.
Hawks:Exactly. But then I could see Dakota. He wasn’t too far ahead of me.
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hawks:And, I was just like, just try and work on catching one at a time. I caught Dakota. I actually was able to get past him pretty quickly. We actually talked and I was like, “Dude, come with me. Come on, let’s go.” Because I knew if we weren’t together, we would fail to be stronger. But he was, I think he was feeling it quite a bit. Yeah, I had a really good descent down to the river. And then I just kind of kept going from there. I think from the river to the finish I ran it in 3 hours in 10 minutes, which, to my knowledge is one of the fastest times ever from the river to the finish, if not the fastest. And so I felt really strong through that section. Maybe that was because I was hunting. I was trying to catch Rod, you know, and that definitely motivated me.
iRunFar:Side note for a minute. Isn’t ultrarunning weird of how bad you can feel for a certain set of real estate, and then how you can come back? It’s just this part of running is so unique how the tables can turn so completely.
Hawks:Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I think it was going into Foresthill I was like, my quads are pretty trashed. I don’t know how I’m going to feel on this downhill going down Cal Street, but then all of a sudden the legs came back and I started like moving really well, and descending really fast and I was like, okay. That’s weird.
iRunFar:Like, here we go.
Hawks:Body just completely changed, you know, and it was great. Yeah, I was able to finish really strong, which I was really happy about.
iRunFar:You finished so strong. I mean, let’s talk about that right now. You, I think, cut 10 minutes into second-place Rod Farvard’s time between Green Gate and the finish, and got, was it 16 seconds from him ultimately at the finish line? To what degree were you hunting? Were you hunting hard?
Hawks:It was hunting till Pointed Rocks, because I kept hearing he was not too far ahead. And then and I thinkHal Koerneractually gave me maybe some misinformation.
iRunFar:Questionable beta.
Hawks:He said he was like two minutes ahead. And I was like, wow, let’s go. Like he’s only two minutes ahead! But I think it was a lot bigger than that.
iRunFar:I think he was trying to motivate me. But then I went into Pointed Rocks and I heard that he had a pretty good lead. And I kind of at that point, I asked my crew, I said, “Well, how far is Dan?” Because I knew Dan was behind me. I said like, “How far back is he?” And he was only like three minutes, maybe four minutes behind me. And I was like, “Oh, I gotta go.”
iRunFar:So, you were starting to worry about Dan rather than Rod.
Hawks:Yeah. I wasn’t even worried about Rod. I just wanted to secure the podium. I want to secure that third-place position. So I was like, I’m going to push from Pointed Rocks to the finish so I can secure and not let Dan pass me. But I ended up catching Rod. So.
iRunFar:Yeah, you totally bridged that gap.
Hawks:Yeah.
iRunFar:I mean, at Robie Point Rod told us that he looked back and saw like, the white clad crew of Hayden Hawks coming and he just felt the fear of God basically.
Hawks:At the bottom of Robie Point, I asked the guys I said, “How far is he?” He’s like, “Oh, he’s gone. You don’t need to worry about him.”
iRunFar:You’re not getting good beta from anyone, are you?
Hawks:Aw, shoot. I thought I was closer. And then I got to the top of Robie Point looked and I saw him. And I was like, “Oh, he’s there!” And I was like, “Well, I gotta try!”
iRunFar:Yeah.
Hawks:And so I just started hammering and I had my crew around me and they were encouraging me. We were just pushing, and I kind of told everyone like, “Shh, be quiet. Be quiet.” Because he hadn’t heard me. He didn’t know I was there. And then like, I thinkTim Tollefsonturned around, who was pacing him and he was like, “Oh, you gotta go!” And I saw him pick it up. And I was like, oh, shoot, that might have been it. You know, but I still was going to try my hardest. And yeah, it ended up becoming a sprint on the track, which was awesome.
iRunFar:You got to use your high school and collegiate racing background.
Hawks:TheOlympic Trialsare going on in Oregon right now. Maybe I should have been there. [laughs] I’m just kidding. No, it was fun. I was just like, there’s no better way to finish. Especially with Rod. Me and Rob did training camp together. We’re really good friends. At training camp actually, me and Rod turned to each other after the long day, and we said, “This is going to be our year.” And when we finished and we you know, we embraced. Rod turned to me and he said, “It was our year! We called this. We called this.” And I was like, “We sure did, man. Like, way to go.”
iRunFar:I mean, you got a teensy bit of heat before the race in your interview with the Singletrack Podcast for saying, you know, we’re really good friends with people when we train, but then on race day, we’re racing. But I think what yesterday showed is that when you have that personal rapport with the people who are around you, Dan Jones behind you, your training partner, you’ve trained with Rod Farvard in front of you, knowing the people around you actually allows all of you to elevate yourselves.
Hawks:Yeah. Well, we’ve talked how there’s no greater respect you can give to somebody than to push them and to make them better. And so that’s what we’re trying to do is, we’re friends, Like we’re super good friends, and we talk to each other all the time. I’ve actually helped Rod with his nutrition, which then he beats me with that. No. [laughs]
iRunFar:Thanks, Rod.
Hawks:But we’ve talked about this all the time is we’re super good friends outside of racing, but when we’re racing, we want to get the best out of each other, and that’s the ultimate form of friendship and respect that we can give. And that’s what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to grow the sport, elevate the sport. We wanted to put on a show for people, and I feel like we did.
iRunFar:A big picture question, like, zooming out on the sport of trail ultrarunning a little bit. You’ve been a part of this for over a decade now. You’ve seen things evolving in front of your eyes. In my mind yesterday, a 100-mile race ran like a 50-mile race, likeThe North Face Endurance Challengecirca 2015. Something like that. What’s your synthesis of like, where the sport has been, where it is now, and where we think it’s going?Hawks:Isn’t it awesome? I love it, man. I love it. Wouldn’t have it any other way. I think the sport’s only going to grow and elevate. I think a lot of brands, you know, Hoka is my sponsor, of course, they are really supporting us as athletes. And they’re really trying to help grow the sport and build the sport, which helps a lot for us to get that support and have that help to be able to be full-time professional athletes. And that’s only going to grow the sport even more. I think there’s a lot of excitement around the sport. I think you know, you guys, the media is doing a great job of covering the sport. Which I can’t thank you enough for that.
iRunFar:You guys are the ones who make the story.
Hawks:But it all helps, and I think that it’s just an exciting time for the sport right now. And I’m really happy that I’m in the middle of it, you know. And I’m trying to help pioneer it and be a good advocate for it, and just try to be a good person and grow the sport as much as possible.
iRunFar:Final question for you before you go to the award ceremony to collect that silver buckle. Finishing in the top 10 position affords you with an automatic entry to come back next year. Your sponsor Hoka just announced it’s continuing its presenting sponsorship of Western States. Are we going to see you again on next year’s starting line or do you sometime in the future hope to be here again?
Hawks:I’ll be back next year.
iRunFar:Okay. It’s already done.
Hawks:Yeah, I mean, I ran 14:24 yesterday, which on most years that would win, you know. And I finished third, which I’m happy with, but yeah, I’m not completely content. I would still want that first place you know. I’m still going to fight for it. I’ve been second. I’ve been third. So I just got to get that last podium spot. And I love this race. I love the community. I love having my friends and family here. And yeah, I’m definitely going to come back and yeah, have another good year.
iRunFar:Awesome. Congratulations to you on your third-place finish at the 2024 Western States Endurance Run. We look forward to seeing you chase that cougar next year.
Hawks:Thank you.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m withEszter Csillag.It’s the day after the 2024Western States 100and you finished third-place for the second year in a row. Congratulations, Eszter.
Eszter Csillag:Thank you so much. Thank you. Nice to see you again.
iRunFar:Nice to see you, too.
Csillag:I hoped to see you.
iRunFar:How do you feel today? You had a personal journey that was as up and as down as the course itself yesterday.
Csillag:Absolutely. It was a roller coaster. Compared to last year when I was really conservative at the start, I wanted to push more from the beginning. And I’m not sure if, for what reason, I had a very low point from Foresthill to the river where I was really not sure how this whole thing will end up. But all in all, I think it was a really interesting race. I mean, to be up front from Dusty Corners, after Dusty Corners I think was when I passedEmily [Hawgood], and I was second till after Michigan Bluff, whenFu-Zhao [Xiang]passed me. And after Foresthill I was sitting at the fifth place. And yeah,Chris Holliswas pacing me from Foresthill to the river, and he gave me this thing. Yeah. [gestures to a pinback button.] But when I arrived to the river, actually, the water and the cool temperature of the water was really, really life changing. I came out and I had that idea, actually from the very beginning, that I need to run up to Green Gate. And that was I think, the only reason why I could catch up with Emily. And after it, I just had to push to the very end, because everyone was pushing. Emily was pushing, so it was a really interesting race and I’m so happy that with that low point, I was able to come back.
iRunFar:So to summarize that, you went out harder in the race this year than last year to try to push yourself. You had a great early section. You hit a pretty significant low point around Foresthill down to the river. According to your badge you did some puking and rallying. You found the cool refreshing waters of American River and a run uphill to Green Gate to be your rejuvenation for a very strong finish to come back from that low point, and move back into podium position. Is that a summary of what happened?
Csillag:Absolutely.
iRunFar:Okay.
Csillag:Yeah, this is the roller coaster of yesterday.
iRunFar:So, take me then to the river. Cal Street is a difficult piece of real estate on any day, and then put it at mile 60 in a race where you’re going down to the hottest part of the course. You already have 60 miles in your legs. You’re adding to that your own low point where you’re sick. How exactly did you get in your mind you would, and then could, do the run uphill to Green Gate and bring your race back?
Csillag:So basically, it was my coachJason Koop. He told me when we met on Thursday, I want you to run up to Green Gate. And he talked to Chris Hollis, when you arriving to the river, you tell her she needs to run up. And then when I came up from the river,HelenandPete, Pete was waiting for me down at the river,Katie Asmuth’shusband. Amazing crew, like everyone. And you remember what you said? You’re going to run up. So they didn’t let me, I had no choice, basically. I had to run up. But it was okay. I think just really the water cooled me down, and after I was fine. After, I just had to make sure that I don’t destabilize again, my body. So I just had to look after that side. But I knew that I have about less than three hours to run, and I just need to keep running.
iRunFar:Where did you ultimately work your way back into podium position? At what mile were you sitting in third again?
Csillag:So, when I arrived to Green Gate, Emily just left, but I saw her. And at the river, she was about six minutes ahead. And then I drank something, and I got some ice, and I changed my socks at Green Gate. So after I think about 20 to 25 minutes, I took her back. And then she was really like, it was a fight till the very end. I knew she was behind me. Yeah. It was a big push till the very end.
iRunFar:What’s it like to race 100 miles and then have the race continue literally to the finish line? Where you know, it’s just minutes till not one woman, but multiple women behind you? What’s in your head in the final miles of something like that?
Csillag:You can’t stop racing. There is no, like, we had to run up to Robie Point. From Robie Point, I was still not sure where Emily is. So I just had to run up from Robie Point as well, and just keep pushing to the very end. And almost like last year, till you hit the track. And like we know from the men’s race, even the track can be kind of a…
iRunFar:A tense place.
Csillag:Exactly. Yeah. Basically, there is no stop. You have no excuse to stop racing early on.
iRunFar:You come around the track. You have your family with you after a long gap, a long time away from them while training here in America. You crossed the line finishing third for the second year in a row. You run about a half hour faster than last year. That’s the third fastest time in the history of the event. Have I got that right?
Csillag:Fourth.
iRunFar:Fourth fastest time in the history of the event. It’s under the time that you were really dreaming about last year,Ellie Greenwood’samazing 2012 course record time. Do you allow yourself to celebrate? Do you allow that to sink in? How is that right now with you?
Csillag:Yes. I’m very proud that I came back, and I was racing to the end. I am very happy how I handled that low point. I’m happy how the whole racing and the whole day unfolded. And how I managed this different situations, and the competition, and so I’m proud of that for sure. On the other hand, I have to analyze what happened. What I did wrong, why I had the low point, because those are the things where if I work on them, then I can be a better runner next time. So I think a deep analysis of that is really important. I do analyze my runs, my races, all the time. So I think there is this competition. There is two sides that I have at the moment, but I’m very happy with yesterday’s result.
iRunFar:You said next time. Does that mean next time in like, the next arbitrary ultra in your future, or is that next time at Western States? As in 2025, see you again?
Csillag:I told toKarina,I will decide later about next year. But let’s say, better I come back or not. But anyway, for both scenarios, like for next ultra, and also if I come back for the next Western States. I have to analyze, get the lesson, and improve on those parts to be better.
iRunFar:One thing that we do know is in your future in a couple of months, you’re signed up to raceUTMBagain. You’ve had two very different experiences at UTMB so far. An incredible race in 2022, and what you would call a heartbreaker drop from UTMB in 2023. You have your mind set on returning to that race and doing it justice by you this year. Is that right?
Csillag:Yes. So, this year the goal is to do the double. And I hope not deciding last moment. And also with the family. We organized our schedule or our duties differently. I can do a good preparation. But on the other hand, after last year lesson, I also have to be very honest whether I am capable, and go to the start line knowing that yeah, I can do this. And don’t be too foolish about just being excited. To be honest, is something that I want to remind myself till the start line.
iRunFar:You’re a member of the Pro Trail Runners Association, the women’s, and I believe it’s called the equity or equality committee. You started a public campaign to bring more attention to the women’s race. So that’s sort of your off-the-trail activity. Your on-the-trail activity really brought attention to the women’s race this year, didn’t it?
Csillag:Yes. So happy how this whole campaign went. We wanted to bring a very positive message that actually the women’s race needs attention. And we need to follow the race to be able to share the stories, the competition, and to be excited. And also just to bring more women into the trail running. So it’s like a campaign that has different goals. But we started with Western States week, and it will go up to UTMB. And it was so amazing. The first batch of the T-shirts, which had the red bold sentence here, “For the women’s race” was sold out in less than one day. And there was one girl who did a homemade T-shirt.
iRunFar:Oh, cool.
Csillag:And she went around and asked all the elite women to sign her T-shirt at the backside. So that was so inspiring to see what she did. And now we are working on the second batch. It will be available online. But really, I think just to bring more attention to the women’s race will be so good in general. Not only for the elite, but for every woman who wants to race or step up in the distance.
iRunFar:Congratulations to you on your second third-place at the 2024 Western States Endurance Run. Congratulations on your own PR. Congratulations on, I think the best way to say it is, just running with both your heart and your mind yesterday.
Csillag:Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

In this interview, our first with Rod, he talks about how he found his way to trail ultrarunning from other sports, his long history of improvement with this event, and his all-day back-and-forth with men’s winnerJim Walmsley.
For more on how the race played out, read our in-depth 2024Western States 100 resultsarticle.
﻿﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withRod Farvardafter his second-place finish at the 2024Western States 100. How are you, Rod?
Rod Farvard:Doing well.
iRunFar:Yeah? Feeling all right after some fast times on the track?
Farvard:Relatively, yeah. I’m walking. I’m eating. Yesterday, it was really rough post-race.
iRunFar:Was it? Just cross the line and straight to puking on the finish?
Farvard:Yep.
iRunFar:We’ll get there. There’s a good journey. Not that long of a journey because it was 14 hours and 24 minutes. But I want to go back into your journey a little bit. It’s our first interview with you, and we always like to find out your story with athletics, maybe specifically with running. When did you get into sports or running?
Farvard:I did cross country and track in high school, like everyone. But I wasn’t a standout whatsoever. My PRs were not notable. I didn’t go to college to run, but I fell in love with the sport, and I decided to race marathons after high school, when I was in college for a couple years. That kind of got boring doing alone, and I missed that team environment. I ended up doing triathlon in the collegiate club program at UC Santa Barbara, and got really into that, and got really into training for that. And my coach was a very great role model, and he actually coaches me today for ultrarunning. But yeah, I competed in college for two years, and then I went on to do Ironmans for another year and a half post-college. And then I started working full time and could not train as much as Ironman athletes do. And I always like to train at a really high level or I feel like I’m wasting my time, so I switch to ultrarunning, which felt more free.
iRunFar:Yes. Much less of a time commitment than Ironman triathlons.
Farvard:[laughs]
iRunFar:How long ago was that? When did you make the switch?
Farvard:2018.
iRunFar:So, a relatively long while ago. It’s been six years.
Farvard:Yeah.
iRunFar:And obviously had quite a strong endurance base going into that time. Did you ramp up pretty quickly with racing ultras or training for ultras, or did you kind of dip your toe in your water and build up from there?
Farvard:I ramped so quick. Yeah. I went straight to 100k and was training a lot, but the hours were low, but the volume for mileage was high, relative to tri, at least. And yeah, I did my first 100k in San Diego at theCuyamaca 100k. I won and set a course record there, and I just didn’t really understand at the time what a deep field means, and what the local 100k means, so I thought I was pretty good at the sport.
iRunFar:No offense, rats. [laughs]
Farvard:Yeah, true. So, I started doing more local ones, winning them, and setting course records. And then I did my first very competitive one at the 2019Black Canyon, where I ended up getting fifth place.
iRunFar:And that felt like you’d gone into a deeper field.
Farvard:Yes, yeah. That felt like a deep field. I was racing for a Golden Ticket. Didn’t happen. And then a month later, ran theNine Trailsin 2019, which was that superstar-packed field with all the Hoka athletes. And I finished fourth there on some home trails in Santa Barbara. And yeah, that’s when I realized I could potentially be good at this and be racing in elite fields.
iRunFar:And things got probably pushed back timewise a little bit with the whole COVID year in 2020.
Farvard:Yeah.
iRunFar:How’d you find your way into Western States for the first time in 2021?
Farvard:Yeah, I got off the lottery. I got onto the waitlist for Western States for the 2020 race, which then got canceled. And then go a year forward to 2021, I got the email probably in March before the race, and I totally forgot that my name was pulled off this waitlist, and I forgot Western States was a thing after COVID year. Like oh, wow, I guess I’m doing this. I think I was 36th on the waitlist and got pulled in a few months before the race. So I started training for it. And got the stoke for it.
iRunFar:When in the year did you actually start training for Western States?
Farvard:Well, I sort of started training in April of 2021 that year, like three months before the race. I quickly got injured. So that got pushed another month. So I was training for about eight weeks before the race.
iRunFar:Which then maybe is not a huge surprise that you didn’t finish your first Western States.
Farvard:I did not.
iRunFar:That puts some context in it. You weren’t gearing up for that for a year and a half or something.
Farvard:I wasn’t gearing up for it. I also didn’t know what the race really entailed. I didn’t understand how hot it gets here. Especially that year. Like, what, 108 at the river or so? Didn’t understand the downhills. Didn’t understand how to eat. So yeah, there’s a recipe for disaster, truly.
iRunFar:And your progress with Western States kind of shows a very upward trajectory, because you had the DNF, which is understandable. And then you had the 23-hour finish, and a 16:15-minute finish more or less, and then 14:24. That’s quite a progression.
Farvard:Yep.
iRunFar:You pretty proud of that?
Farvard:I am, yeah. I love this race. I truly do. It’s so easy to pick apart and understand where you need to improve on the course. So, I think, like picking up time like that, it’s not easy, but it’s easy to conceptualize where you need to pick up the time in order to do it. And that makes coming back every year, when you can, extremely fun and extremely motivating.
iRunFar:Was this year’s race fun for you?
Farvard:Oh, man.
iRunFar:[laughs]
Farvard:Fun’s a strong word, but this year was, I’ve never been in this mental space in a race ever, that I was in this year and that was racing from step one. Except like maybe a 50k or something, but I mean for a long ultra, 100k to 100 mile, there was no time for me to chill. And it’s not like I went in the race of wanting to do that. I don’t know. The gun started and that’s where my mind went. And I didn’t feel a single emotion on the day, you know. I didn’t feel what fun is. I was just out there racing every step, and my mind was just completely zoned in, completely blocked out. I don’t think I waved or said hi to anyone. I apologize for that. But yeah, it was completely different.
iRunFar:Did you cross the Escarpment in first?
Farvard:I did, which I felt like, oh man, I’m going to shit for this probably. [laughs]
iRunFar:Had you not more or less stuck the race, which let’s be honest, you did, yes, you probably would have got some shit for sending the Escarpment. People now sometimes get up to the top and win the race, but historically, that was not the case.
Farvard:Well, to be honest, I felt bad forJim [Walmsley].
iRunFar:[laughs]
Farvard:I don’t know why I’m saying that. But everyone’s just keying off him, and he’s just anyone else in the race. You know, he’s just a runner. But everyone made sure they were right behind him. He started going slow, you know, slower than slow, and everyone started dropping back behind him, too. I’m like why, guys. If anything I wanted to get in the front so I could have a clear singletrack in the high country and not have to worry about footing, and can control the pace. Which actually took what felt really chill, and just felt like my pace when I crested and was able to lead us.
iRunFar:There was no intimidation of you’re going back and forth multiple times with Jim during the race. He doesn’t pass you and you’re like, “Oh, crap. Jim just passed me. Game over.”
Farvard:There’s some of that. Yeah, but so I counted. When Jim and I actually started battling, it was at Michigan Bluff, which I thought he got out of that climb way faster than me, and I thought he was out of the aid station way faster than me. But I rolled out of that aid station and then I heard some people running behind me. I figured it was just a film crew. And I looked back, and there’s Jim. I’m like, oh. I did a few double-takes and I’m like, okay. I guess we’re going to run today together. And from there to Green Gate, which is a few miles after that, he ultimately made the decisive move and passed me. We had 10 lead switches between each other.
iRunFar:Were you ever running together? Was it always just a pass or were there a couple of minutes where you were rolling together?
Farvard:A couple minutes. I would say after Foresthill, no. It was just passing back and forth, but dropping down Volcano Canyon before climbing out Bath Road, we were running a stretch together. We dunked in a river together. He advised me to get fully wet. You know, he was giving some tips.
iRunFar:You took them.
Farvard:Yeah, I took them. And then we ran the climb up together until the road which he started to take off and got into Foresthill first.
iRunFar:Which you can’t feel too bad about. Was it exhausting? Having to keep on that edge of effort? Or like, I can’t imagine being passed 10 times by the same person in a race, or vice versa.
Farvard:Yeah, it was exhausting. It was hard to tell if this is going to be the last time I saw him or not. And there’s kind of this decision you have to make mentally of, am I going to fight, or am I just happy with second place? And at the end of the day, I just kept my pace that felt sustainable in that moment. And that eventually led to some passes. But yeah, when he made that last move by me, we were climbing up the hill between Green Gate and Auburn Lakes Trails. It’s not very steep. It’s probably like a 6 to 7% grade. But I’ve never seen anyone run up a hill faster, it felt like.
iRunFar:[laughs]
Farvard:I’m like, okay, I’m doing what I can here. And maybe he blows himself up before the finish, but wow, he looks strong here. And I had to focus on myself at that point.
iRunFar:Were things getting a bit rough for yourself then?
Farvard:Yeah, I wasn’t climbing quite as strong, which was kind of the theme of the day between me and Jim. I think I was descending a little better, and he was climbing a lot better. So I walk-climbed, or walk-ran some of the climbs after Quarry Road. And I think that’s where I lost a lot of time toHayden [Hawks]behind me, too. Then I heard every aid station he was just making up some time. So I was just focusing myself, and trying to keep second place at that point.
iRunFar:Were you getting pretty worried?
Farvard:A little bit. Yeah. Yeah, I think at Pointed Rocks there was five minutes between me and Hayden, which he cut down from 10 minutes at Green Gate. And I was like, okay, he has to run a minute per mile faster than me to catch me here. That’s not going to happen.
iRunFar:And then?
Farvard:[laughs] Well, and then, I mean, I thought I had it, and got up to Robie Point andTim [Tollefson], who was pacing me.
iRunFar:Tim Tollefson?
Farvard:Tollefson. Who was pacing me on the road section to Robie Point.Chris Brownpaced me most of it beforehand. Tim said, “Okay, do you want to go underJared [Hazen]’stime and be the second-fastest person at Western States?” I said, “No, I just want to take it in.” Because I was already at that point, too. And he was like, “Alright, buddy. Let’s take it in.” And we make that final, final, very short bump that everyone hates after Robie, and Tim decides to look back, and he sees Hayden’s sea of white entourage behind us. And he’s like. “We gotta go.”
iRunFar:[laughs]
Farvard:And I think it’s half a mile from there. And yeah, just all out from there, but I was I was hating every moment.
iRunFar:And you’re in the straightaway together. Literally.
Farvard:Yeah, yeah. We hit the track. I actually don’t know. I don’t know what was happening there. I was just like, I need to go all out.
iRunFar:And you did. I think, talking to Hayden, he ran something like a 5:23 last mile.
Farvard:Oh my god.
iRunFar:So you’ve got to be sub-6:00 probably.
Farvard:Yeah. Yeah.
iRunFar:And you cross the line and you’re puking.
Farvard:Yeah.
iRunFar:Are you happy you pushed that far?
Farvard:Yeah. I am. Extremely. I guess I know what it means to be first. I don’t know what it means to be second or third and what the difference is, but it felt really important for me to get second place.
iRunFar:And you feel like you got the best out of yourself yesterday.
Farvard:Absolutely.
iRunFar:And there’s nothing you can be more proud of than that, right?
Farvard:Nothing. Yes.
iRunFar:What was your best memory from the day? Or maybe like, the most memorable moment. It doesn’t have to be the best. Like, what stands out from yesterday?
Farvard:Yeah, I think it was a painful moment, but going elbow-to-elbow with Jim up from the river to Green Gate.
iRunFar:Just throwin’ down.
Farvard:Throwin’ down.
iRunFar:Mano a mano.
Farvard:Yeah, just trying to understand how he was feeling in the moment, and what I needed to do here. And I know he didn’t take crew on the other side of the river, so I knew he was going to stop here. And I was just curious if that was going to be my moment to go. And I thought it was. And God, the guy just has these second winds, atUTMB, at Western States, that just are unbelievable, really. And I’m super inspired by him.
iRunFar:Nice. What’s next for you?
Farvard:Potentially, I mean, I’m signed up. We’ll see if I can get training together and have a good summer, but I’m going to go to theDiagonale des Fous, the Grand Raid.
iRunFar:Congratulations on a tremendous run at Western States.
Farvard:Thank you. Thank you. Day to remember.
iRunFar:Take care.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withFu-Zhao Xiangafter her second-place finish at the 2024Western States 100. How are you?
Fu-Zhao Xiang:[speaking in English, sometimes with the assistance of a translator] I’m fine. Thank you so much. I feel very amazing.
iRunFar:That was a tremendous run out there. It was your first Western States, and you ran it like a veteran.
Xiang:This is mistaken about Western States, because last year, I’m a pacer last year. As a pacer, familiar [with] a lot of course. Of other runners, the top ten, six females came back, so last year I saw them in the race.
iRunFar:Yeah. But still, to run all 100 miles of the course, you were very smart, I thought, and you continued to move up the first half of the race. You were not slow, but maybe relaxed to start?
Xiang:Yesterday, all the way, I feel very good. Later over half. Because your first half, you have up, hard up, I will work. You have easy uphill, slowly. But in the last half, the last 30k, with the uphill, I can run.
iRunFar:You can run.
Xiang:Yeah.
iRunFar:And you felt good all day.
Xiang:Yeah. I think the last part, I feel is better than the first half. Maybe my pacer is good for me. Because we are the same, the same leg, same pace.
iRunFar:Who was your pacer?
Xiang:My pacer isGuang-Fu Meng. So I have the most strongest pacer in the race. Yeah.
iRunFar:Well, that’s amazing to feel better the whole way, because atUTMBthat’s not always true, yes?
Xiang:Yeah, so I need to change my plan in UTMB this year from this race I start a lot. Yeah. In the before, I needed slow.
iRunFar:You needed to be more slow at the beginning of UTMB?
Xiang:Yes, I will. I think I can try. Maybe the result is different.
iRunFar:Yeah, that’s a good strategy. In watching you in the race, from Foresthill at 100 kilometers to the river crossing, you ran as fast asKatie [Schide]. You ran so fast. Did you feel really good for those kilometers? you Bye
Xiang:I can’t believe I run the same pace with Katie. Wow.
iRunFar:But not just Katie, I think it was very fast. Did you feel like you were going very fast?
Xiang:Yes. This part, because this is 30 kilometer, more downhill. I think I’m better, downhill is better than my uphill.
iRunFar:Yeah, and the footing, the trail is very nice. Fast.
Xiang:Yes.
iRunFar:I saw you at the river. [laughs] What happened? What went wrong?
Xiang:[laughs] Maybe I’m too short.
iRunFar:Referencing Fu-Zhao was in the river and got swept off the rope and was going down the river.
Xiang:Many, after the race, many people said, “Fu-Zhao cannot swimming?” No, I can. When I was in college, I also ran some triathlons.
iRunFar:Triathlons. So you are a good swimmer! But the river is very fast.
Xiang:Yes. Just the river’s very fast.
iRunFar:And so your pacer helped and the volunteer helped to bring you back. Was it scary?
Xiang:No, not scary, because I think I can swim in no problem. [laughs]
iRunFar:I love it. So it didn’t take the energy away.
Xiang:Oh yes. I think it did. Yeah.
iRunFar:It was not very hot, but it was hot yesterday.
Xiang:I think it was okay, because before the race I do a lot of sauna. The sauna helped for me. Yes. My coach told me you must do sauna before race.
iRunFar:Back at home at Chongqing before you came over, also very hot.
Xiang:Yes. But different.
iRunFar:Yeah. So you spent some time in the river. Was it nice to cool off?
Xiang:Yes. Because close to sunlight.
iRunFar:So you said you felt better on the second half of the race. Did you anytime think you could catch Katie?
Xiang:Never.
iRunFar:No?
Xiang:I think if I can keep was the same gap, it’s okay.
iRunFar:Yes. Same difference. In those maybe final 30 kilometers, are you at all scared of the people behind you, or do you feel strong and that you can hold your position?
Xiang:I’m not afraid, because I think I feel good and I feel easy. And so if my pacer paced faster, I also can follow him.
iRunFar:You can go faster.
Xiang:I think, yeah.
iRunFar:What was the biggest challenge or the toughest point yesterday?
Xiang:For me, because I got an injury before. Not totally recovered yet.
iRunFar:What was the injury if I may ask?
Xiang:My Achilles and my knee. Yesterday. I also feel pain in my knee sometimes. So, the knee pain started at 50k. At 50k I felt maybe I cannot finish the race. But I didn’t tell my support. I just kept it as a secret to myself. I didn’t tell anybody. Just kept trying.
iRunFar:And speaking of that, I’ve raced internationally as well, and it can be hard because you can’t talk with everybody. Were you able to run withLin Chensome of the race?
Xiang:Yes. From 20k I saw Lin Chen in the front and she always follow me.
iRunFar:So you did not spend time together?
Xiang:From 20k, we’re always together.
iRunFar:Did you talk some?
Xiang:Lin Chen is following me, and I talked to Lin Chen: If you feel better, you can go. But we stay together.
iRunFar:So maybe you were stronger.
Xiang:I just keep my own pace when somebody is following me.
iRunFar:Do you think this was your best ultramarathon performance?
Xiang:Yes, of course. For now. I hope in the future, it will be some other race.
iRunFar:Did you not enjoy the race here?
Xiang:Yes, very enjoy.
iRunFar:Oh, you did, okay. But you want to do better.
Xiang:Yes, of course. Because I have ticket to come back.
iRunFar:You’ll come back?
Xiang:Yeah. I was very happy that I got a chance this year. So I think I will do better.
iRunFar:I know it’s one day after, but do you have anything you would do differently? Anything you learned that you would change?
Xiang:Going from this race, I must be very calm in the race, but also maybe in the first half, I need to run faster. Maybe next year.
iRunFar:And what other races will you run this year?
Xiang:UTMB. AndNinghai by UTMB.
iRunFar:Ninghai by UTMB. Well, good luck, and congratulations on a great race here. Thank you.
Xiang:Thank you so much. This is my first after-race where you interviewed me.
iRunFar:It’s my pleasure.
Xiang:You also interviewed me inTransgrancanaria.
iRunFar:Yes, I remember.
Xiang:Perhaps we can interview again.
iRunFar:Yeah. Congratulations.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withJim Walmsleyafter his win of the 2024Western States 100. How are you, Jim?
Jim Walmsley:Doing good. Yeah. Really satisfied after yesterday.
iRunFar:Are you?
Walmsley:Yeah.
iRunFar:You’ve had a couple of races that didn’t go well here, a couple of races that have gone phenomenally. Where you put yesterday amongst?
Walmsley:Definitely in phenomenal category, if not in contention of the best run I’ve ever had here, and that, especially when you just get caught in a dogfight at the end, you don’t know what you’re going to have, how you’re going to respond, and you take away so much when those answers are there, and the legs are there, and you’re able to get the most out of yourself, and it takes competition to get to that level.
iRunFar:I was going to say, is it more rewarding having a perfect time trial, or to have where you are battling the whole way?
Walmsley:I like the time trial better. A little less stressful. It’s controlled by me.
iRunFar:[laughs]
Walmsley:But this one’s a lot more rewarding than a time trial going perfect. And yeah, my two fastest times I’ve had someone on my heels. This one even more so. But in front of me. Not even on my heels.
iRunFar:Many times.
Walmsley:Many times. So yeah, it was another fast year.
iRunFar:In retrospect, did you feel on top of your game coming into the race? Were you A+ Jim?
Walmsley:Yeah, I mean, I didn’t do many tests. I don’t do as many tests as I used to do as a younger self and, so I was confident. But nothing to point at and say it’s there, but confident. And then I think looking at the weather and kind of how I was feeling, and even a little uphill race last weekend felt good and kind of check, check, check. And so I was thinking I could beat my second-fastest time of 14:30, and thinking that maybe 14:20s would be what it takes. But also, I did no pace splits. I did know some splits, rough estimates, but usually like, three and a half hours, four and a half hours. Just nine hours at Foresthill. I know that’s kind of the ballpark to be in but yeah, I just ran completely by feel all day and just let my legs take care of me.
iRunFar:So going up the Escarpment,Rod [Farvard]was at saying like it seemed like you were going slower intentionally maybe, or did it feel that way? Were you chilling on your way up the first climb?
Walmsley:Yeah, I want to chill. I think if you’re antsy and you’re chomping at the bit to get going, it’s not the best place to be in a 100 miler. You need to be patient and relaxed and let the day come to you.
iRunFar:This is not Jim 2016. [laughs]
Walmsley:No. I think I said in a previous interview with someone else that I wouldn’t want to race my younger self, but it has to do mostly with you just know it’s going to start with fire, and you don’t know is it going to stick, is it not going to stick, but you have to go with it. So you don’t know if I’m coming back. And I think you still have to call the shots of the younger self and just mentally be prepared for a fast run.
iRunFar:I mean, you’ve been pushed here before byJared Hazen.
Walmsley:Yeah, but it was a very, very different experience because we didn’t see each other all day. I just knew that I was not gaining any time. I was not losing any. It was just there. I think it was stuck at eight minutes all day, and just this ghost of fear, where this one there was such a battle going on. Especially with Rod throughout most of the day. And I think it wasHayden [Hawks]andDan Jonesthat first caught me, which up until that point, I didn’t know if everybody was just going to let me go and just like, oh, Jim does his thing and we’re going to run slower. Because that’s generally what happens, but then they ended up catching me and passing me, and so descending into Swinging Bridge, just kind of sat on them a bit, but I think the pace really chilled. And then before we hit the Swinging Bridge, essentially,Dakota [Jones]and Rod caught us right at the bottom, but then ran up Devil’s Thumb and was able to make gaps on the uphill. And there’s a big confidence check of just where everybody’s at and knowing that a climb like that I can just put at least a minute, but maybe more. I was with everybody, I was behind there. I started the climb behind all of them and then was at least a minute ahead. I don’t know exactly. So then the idea was well, maybe we go over the top and see. Because I think when the pack develops behind, if they get really complacent all of a sudden, if I can attack, then all of a sudden boom, I got 10 minutes. And it’s like, alright, now I’m in full control. But I’d say that didn’t happen. I got followed and chased and passed many, many times after that.
iRunFar:Yeah, that’s not something that you really used to. Because atUTMB, many years people will go out together and it’ll be seven guys and then five guys.
Walmsley:It’s attrition. Yeah.
iRunFar:And three guys, and by Courmayeur you might be alone by then. Or there might be one other guy.
Walmsley:I think there’s enough difference in strategies with this temperature management that creates a lot of that yo-yo effect. So I stuck to my plans and took care of me and what I needed to do and sometimes that cost me time, and just thinking that it would keep me fresher longer, and there would be an opportunity late. And I feel like at this point, I’ve been in some really hard-fought ultras, and just drawing confidence on those experiences. And yet again, I’m going to draw a lot of confidence from this one just knowing that I was able to respond when I needed to.
iRunFar:Did it ever start to feel like a two-man race with you and Rod?
Walmsley:I had no idea. I think we had heard someone’s coming to the river behind us. So that was my first thought. But I don’t know. And then I think the last time I passed Rod, 80-something miles, I didn’t know if someone was coming hard charging. You’re going to pass Rod, and then it’s like, what’s the gap behind me? And I’m like, I don’t know. Who’s it behind me, or what’s happening? All I know is I was really desperate to try to put some time in to not have an extreme race from Pointed Rocks in. I’d say there’s history of that happening. I think most notably like,Clare Gallagherand think, was itBrittany [Peterson]? Crazy downhill finish, and just knowing that can happen. I don’t want to get caught in that. So if I can deflate a little bit to just make it three minutes and just put in someone’s head they got to close 20 seconds, 30 seconds per mile faster. And if I can maintain a good pace, then I know I have a chance of not having a sprint finish.
iRunFar:Rod said it felt like you made a pretty distinct move heading toward ALT. Is that the case?
Walmsley:From his perception, probably it seems like that, but I mean, I left Green Gate, I glanced up when he was moving out. And then I glanced when I was at the same spot, and it was over two and a half minutes. So, in reality I was hard-charging to catch him and took four miles just to catch him. But at that point, I knew my momentum was going faster. So a littleZach Millerscenario again, like, do I pause, relax, or just go over the top and attack again? And yeah, I like that strategy I guess. So I just kept flowing. Because sometimes you slow or you change the pace a bit and maybe the feeling in the legs can change. The legs were feeling really good. The feet were feeling good. And I continued to roll with it.
iRunFar:There are historic cases of your people having collapses in the last 10 miles.
Walmsley:It’s in my head. I think I jokingly said I’m not going to run in 2026. Just the sixes are bad luck.
iRunFar:It’s not just you.
Walmsley:Brian Morrisonhad 2006. I had 2016. So the joke after mine was just years with six are bad. Yeah, good one to skip.
iRunFar:So is there some point in the last ten miles where you feel like you have a nice little cushion and your legs still feel good and you can kind of cruise? Not take it for granted but like cruise a bit?
Walmsley:At Pointed Rocks I think I had heard from my crew that the gap had opened, and essentially I was going to be able to hold on, but then at the same time I still want to continue to press, because people get motivated as they started smelling barn. And I know that happens, and I didn’t want someone hard-charging to be able to catch me.
iRunFar:You also didn’t have to take any risks.
Walmsley:Yeah, it definitely came to more management after Pointed Rocks.
iRunFar:Did you have any real low spells during the race?
Walmsley:I would say not like really low spells, but lots of low moments. I would say the dips weren’t so low. But flatness. Stomach issues. So, there’s ups and downs. I mean, average or warm year is still hot, and it’s to be expected. So, I think I was mentally prepared for the moments I did have. And then probably caught fire after Green Gate, I would say was kind of the only real flow that I felt I got, but perhaps that’s just mentally hanging in there, latching on when I needed to, and using the momentum of Rod and his pacers. I mean, he had an all-star team. So, latching on when I had to, and making it hard to get a gap. And just hanging, hanging, and knowing that if you get close enough, the motivation changes, and it can happen.
iRunFar:Yeah. So even though you’ve run a little bit faster on this course once, does this feel on par with that?
Walmsley:Yeah. I mean it was 14 degrees warmer. Perhaps we’re seeing rollover into some faster shoe stuff playing a factor. I mean, you have to consider that. I’ve joked that I drive here because I’m completely overkill with coolers, ice, crew, redundancy. Because I know what can go wrong, perhaps will go wrong, and just trying to make redundancy and that’s probably why the success of good races at this point. But you see more and more people doing more overboard, and I’m now at a point where I need to start looking a lot more around me, because people are doing a lot of good things that I need to consider adopting as well.
iRunFar:So it’s not just the competition pushing one another and the whole bar raising, its little incremental changes that different people are making.
Walmsley:There’s more and more people taking it as serious as I was taking it. And perhaps I came in with a bit of more intensity to try to go over the top with what I’m doing, and how I’m managing and this and that. Now you see people coming in with different strategies that are faster, essentially.
iRunFar:Have you picked any up in the last year or two?
Walmsley:I stuck with the same system that I’ve done. Two bottles, lots of ice everywhere. I know some places I need to adjust and carry things a bit more efficiently. The patient taking-care-of-myself strategy has proved to be a closer race in not-as-hot of years but it tends to work year to year.
iRunFar:You’ve won this race four times. You have the course record. You have a lot of the fastest times on the course.
Walmsley:A lot of my times got bumped back.
iRunFar:Yeah. Aside from this year. And now finally hit your goal of winning UTMB. You’ve accomplished a lot. There’s not a lot of boxes left to check. What motivates you? What’s next?
Walmsley:At this level it becomes more and more almost zeroing in on the Western States. Zeroing in on the UTMBs, and those really, as a career, set you apart and now you get compared to theKilians [Jornet],François [D’Haene],Courtneys[Dauwalter]and essentially, that’s the category I guess I shoot for at this point. I mean, I feel like I lost that race several times. I felt like I broke away several times. And the ups and downs of this race was really wild.
iRunFar:So you could keep seeing yourself continuing to come back here?
Walmsley:Yeah, I think I told just before this race, if I can win either one again, perhaps the idea is to just try to defend titles as long as I can. And when that ends and ends, but I don’t know. But then also I think next year in 2025, UTMB and theTrail World Championshipskind of conflict. The Trail World Championships isn’t a race I’ve been able to participate in, and it’s going to be in the Pyrenees, which I think is really cool mountain range. And really steep, really like something almost similar to UTMB. So that one’s really attracting, but we’ll have to see what goes on with UTMB this year.
iRunFar:You’re constantly thinking of legacy, and legacy in the terms of being one of those real dominant people in a particular race or two.
Walmsley:Yeah. And then whether I go back to road ultras, I don’t know. I’ve always said those kind of suck my energy a lot. Like marathon. It’s just really, really hard to concentrate on speed, fluidness with your stride, efficiency, asphalt surfaces. Road shoes now. I don’t know. But I definitely enjoy the trails. I think that’s where my heart is, and probably where I’ll stay.
iRunFar:Right on. Well, congratulations on your great run.
Walmsley:Thanks so much.
iRunFar:Take care.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Meghan Hicks of iRunFar. I’m withKatie Schide.It’s the day after the 2024Western States 100, and you’re the women’s champion. Congratulations, Katie.
Katie Schide:Thank you.
iRunFar:How does that feel?
Schide:It feels really good. This has been a long time in the making, and really happy it all came together yesterday.
iRunFar:Yeah, the Western States Endurance Run has been a dedication for you for now two seasons. What’s it like to have crossed the finish? Achieved, I mean, far surpassed your performance from last year. And I have to say, you must have achieved all the goals you wanted yesterday.
Schide:Yeah, definitely. I mean, afterUTMBin 2022 when I received the Golden Ticket, I think it’s just been everything focused on this race. And I’m not sure I actually, from the start, ever thought I could win this race. It was always a big challenge to try to take on such a fast and hot and different kind of race course than in Europe. And I think last year gave me a glimpse of what could be possible. And I was super happy with how everything went last year, and then just tried to bring it up a little notch this year. And yeah, things don’t always come together on the right day, but I’m really happy they did yesterday.
iRunFar:Now the public gets to be privy, or got to be privy, to a bit of your training block building up to this. We saw your incredible performance at theCanyons 100k. I would love to know just a few of the details beyond you know, what went into this really spectacular training block.
Schide:I mean, just about everything is out there. I did pretty similar build-up from last year. A little bit different early season race. I did Canyons this year, which just gave me a chance to get out on the course and build some confidence running on these trails again. Kind of get it in my head again before heading to Flagstaff for two months. Spent a lot of time this spring at my partner’s parents’ house. Close to Nice [France] where I could run on dry, dry trails while we were still getting three meters of snow at home. But yeah, there’s a lot of pieces behind it. Not just the training but the support from my family here from my partnerGermain [Grangier]and his parents, and everyone kind of letting me do my thing and just being there whenever I needed them. So yeah, of course the training is a big part of it, but I think it’s all the support I have around it that really makes a difference.
iRunFar:I mean, I really think that’s what we are seeing as trail running continues to professionalize. And you’re just an absolute demonstration of that, that yes, there’s the training, but then there’s the full support system. There’s what you’re doing when you’re not training. There’s the people around you. There’s the psychology you keep. And yeah, it just seemed like bam, bam, bam, everything was there for you this training block.
Schide:Yeah, I mean, it wasn’t all easy, but I think when things got difficult, I had the right people and the right tools to problem solve and make it work. And it’s not just the last two months. I mean, at this point, it’s been two years for this race in particular. And one of the bigger things is just that I’ve been gone from home for two months each year. I think having support networks on both continents that totally understand that. And it’s not easy being away from Germain when I’m here for two months and we’re both training for different races, but just the fact that we never had to really discuss that. It was just understood. We support each other in whatever we want to do, and that’s what makes us happiest. So I’m really looking forward to getting back home.
iRunFar:I think that’s the only thing that would have made yesterday sweeter was if there had been a Germain at the track cheering you in.
Schide:Yeah, definitely. If he had been here, I would have maybe taken a pacer.
iRunFar:So let’s talk a little bit about yesterday. One of the things that was unique about this race for everybody but you was that it was a race against human beings all the way to the finish line. But for you, you were far ahead in the women’s race, almost from the get go, and your lead kept extending, extending, extending. You are running with men of course, but the women’s field was behind you. What was it like to run so much of yesterday with splits with numbers with yourself? I guess you’ve said before you like to train alone, so there’s that, but…
Schide:Yeah, the start was really great because I got to share, I think until after Devil’s Thumb, withSimon Gosselin,who’s French, so I was actually speaking in French for the first half of the race.
iRunFar:Amazing.
Schide:Which was just kind of fun to have something else to think about. And yeah, we had a really good time, and I think we set a good pace for each other. And at that point in the race, I was just focused on being consistent. Picking my own pace, not pushing, where I thought it might do any damage. Mostly trying to play on the safe but efficient side. And then when I was learning more about my gap on the other women, of course it gives me a little bit of calmness, that there’s not someone right on my heels. But when you know that the pack behind you is all racing each other, you know the chance of them making up time on you as much greater. So I wasn’t super comfortable. I was still trying to kind of just stay in control and be smart and not lose any time anywhere. But also take the time to not mess up. Just trying to maintain that gap. Because the primary goal at that point was to win. I didn’t need to prove any specific time goal to myself. When I started doing all the math, I could see that I could probably go under 16 hours. So then that became a new goal toward the end, which gave me just a little bit extra motivation in those final 30k where it’s super hard between Green Gate and Quarry Road.
iRunFar:You said that you were just trying to stay calm but maybe you’re having an inner dialogue of like,Don’t mess up. Stay calm. Don’t mess up. Stay calm.But you gave off this vibe continuously yesterday of being in control, being calm. Whatever emotions were going on inside of you, you weren’t wearing them on your face. Just share a little bit about how did you pass the time in your mind?
Schide:I have no idea. I would say the vast majority of my training is alone and without headphones. So that’s what I do every day.
iRunFar:That’s amazing.
Schide:So I’m just doing my normal thing. Yeah, it was just kind of telling myself like just as usual. Just do what you normally do. Like, no stress. There’s no need to change anything. I think that was also part of my decision to not take a pacer was just to be able to fully be in my own head and not be thinking about anything else. And I think that lets me save a bit of energy. Personally, I’m someone who, yeah, in everyday life I’m an introvert, so it just lets me not feel like I’m losing energy to anyone else.
iRunFar:What were the hardest parts yesterday? Was there a singular moment that you’ll remember that you just really had to apply a little bit more grit than usual? Or was there a period of time that you would like to like leave behind in this experience?
Schide:That last 30k from Green Gate to Quarry Road.
iRunFar:The whole thing.
Schide:It’s just so hard. It all looks the same. It’s really not that interesting. It’s pretty flat. You have to run. It’s when everything is starting to hurt. I had a lot of trouble there last year. And so this year was, I was really thinking about that section the whole time. Like I want to get through that without losing a ton of time like last year. And that was actually the only section where I was really looking at my splits. And that was great because I could see that I was a lot faster than last year. And that was just reassuring like, hey, I’m doing better than last year. Things are going to be okay.
iRunFar:Now for those of us following your race, we were looking split to split, section by section, your progress this year compared to last year, and your run this year compared to the course record. Were you doing the same thing or were you running, and you said a little bit by splits at the end, but how aware were you of the numbers on the ultimate clock?
Schide:Well, the first thing is that I missed the first seven minutes on my watch.
iRunFar:So you didn’t actually know the time.
Schide:So all of my math in my head, I was trying to add the seven minutes. I didn’t really know. I kind of knew the first splits until Robinson because it’s more or less one hour, but I didn’t know them at all. I was asking people in Michigan Bluff where I was compared to last year because I just didn’t know. And I think going into this race, because everyone played up last year as being slow at the start with the snow, and then not super hot, so maybe faster after. I wasn’t trying to get too caught up in times. It’s only my second time during the race. So I don’t have like,Jim [Walmsley], a whole Encyclopedia of my times here likeScott [Jurek]orAnn Trasonor someone like that. So yeah, it was just focused on just doing what I felt good with. And when I started getting my splits compared to last year, I was like oh, okay. But I didn’t know that. I think I did the first part to Robinson 20 minutes faster. So I don’t know. I was just going by feel mostly.
iRunFar:Yeah. You are now and have been the champion of some big 100 milers. You have been champion ofDiagonale des Fous, UTMB, now Western States. What could possibly be next?
Schide:Hardrock 100. [laughs]
iRunFar:Okay. Hardrock. Just putting that out there. Is there is there a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment right now being like, I’ve been working toward this Western States goal now for a couple of years and now I get to have this on my CV?
Schide:Yeah. I mean, my journey with UTMB was quite long, but I think this one was a bit more, I don’t know the right word. Maybe like intense, more focused.
iRunFar:Committed.
Schide:Yeah, more committed. That’s a good word. Yeah, so this felt really good. Just the commitment to leave home, come here twice, and kind of change up what I would normally do in my running. UTMB fit more in my normal lifestyle, so it feels really good and really, yeah. I’m really happy with this one.
iRunFar:It’s really offensive to ask a person the day after they run 100 miles if they would like to come back and run it again. However, this is one of those unique races that when you finish in the top 10 you get an automatic return then if you’d like it. Have you started thinking about 2025 and this year’s track?
Schide:I am not sure. I would say I think I would like to do a little bit more skiing next year.
iRunFar:A little bit less winter running, a little more snow play.
Schide:Yes.
iRunFar:Okay. Congratulations to you on your win of the 2024 Western States 100, for running the second fastest time ever, and for accomplishing a very committed goal.
Schide:Thank you.

2024 Western States 100 Results: Walmsley Wins a Fourth Time While Schide Rocks the Women’s Field,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-western-states-100-results,"For hours,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) chased ghosts. For hours,Jim Walmsley(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) andRodFarvard(post-race interview) chased each other. And in the end, after 100 courageous, gutsy miles at one of the world’s most iconic ultramarathons, it was Schide and Walmsley who won a fast, dramatic 2024Western States 100.
Schide, an American who lives in France, was on pace to break the course record until late in the race, while Americans Walmsley and Farvard battled throughout most of the second half of the race, alternating the lead as late as mile 85.
Schide’s winning time was 15:46:57, just over 17 minutes behindCourtney Dauwalter’s2023 course record, almost an hour faster than her own time last year, and the second fastest women’s time ever. Walmsley, meanwhile, won his fourth Western States in 14:13:45, the second fastest time ever — only behind his own record of 14:09:28 that heset in 2019.
Second and third in the men’s race came down to an epic sprint finish on the track between Farvard andHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), who finished in 14:24:15 and 14:24:31, respectively.
In the women’s race for the podium,Fu-Zhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) finished second in 16:20:03, andEszter Csillag(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) took third for the second time in a row, in 16:42:17.
Both races featured one of the deepest and most competitive fields in race history, with the men’s top five all coming in faster than last year’s winning time, and the women’s top 10 finishing just under 40 minutes faster than last year’s incredibly competitive top 10.
At 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 29, they were all among the 375 runners who began the historic route from Olympic Valley to Auburn, California, traversing 100.2 miles of trail with 18,000 feet of elevation gain and 22,000 feet of loss. After last year’s cool temperatures, the weather at this year’s race was a bit warmer, albeit with a notable lack of snow in the high country. The high temperature in Auburn was in the low 90s Fahrenheit.

In his return to the race that propelled him to the heights of global trail running and his first ultra on American soil in three years,Jim Walmsley(pre-race interview) demonstrated why he is, once again, the king of Western States. Before the race, Walmsley exuded a calmness that perhaps eluded him during his first attempts, when he attacked it with an obsessive intensity that led him to famously take a wrong turn and then dropping out in back-to-back years.
“We’ll just roll with what plays out and just kind of see what happens in the race,” he said in hispre-race interview. There’s a marked difference when compared to his remarks from hisinterviewbefore the 2016 race.
What happened in the race was this: In his fourth Western States,Rod Farvard(post-race interview) had the race of his life to push Walmsley like he’d never been pushed before in his long history with the event.
Farvard — a 28-year-old from Mammoth Lakes, California, who has improved his finish each year at the race, from a DNF in 2021 to 41st place in 2022 to 11th place last year — put himself in a strong position from the start, leading a large pack of runners that included Walmsley at the top of the Escarpment, the 2,500-foot climb in the first four miles of the race. For the next 45-plus miles, Farvard remained in the top 10, part of a chase pack of AmericanHayden Hawks(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), KiwiDan Jones(pre-race interview), and Chinese runnerGuo-Min Deng, among others.

At the Robinson Flat aid station at mile 30 — the symbolic end of the runners’ time in the high country, which features an average elevation of around 7,000 feet — Walmsley, who started the race conspicuously wearing all black, came through in 4:24 looking fast and smooth, now wearing an ice-soaked white shirt. Jones,the 2024 Tarawera 102k championand fifth-place finisher in his Western States debut last year, and Hawks,who set the course record at February’s Black Canyons 100kafter dropping out of last year’s Western States, followed about 90 seconds later. The two runners, frequent training partners, ran together frequently throughout the day, with Hawks often foregoing ice at aid stations.
After the trio of Walmsley, Hawks, and Jones went through Last Chance at mile 43 together, Walmsley put nearly two minutes on them up the climb to Devil’s Thumb. “I was with everybody at the bottom,” he said, according to the race’s official livestream.
About halfway through, at mile 49.5, the order remained the same: Walmsley in the lead with an elapsed time of 6:58, followed by Jones one minute back, Hawks two minutes back, and Farvard just over two and a half minutes back. The rest of the top 10 were last year’s 17th-place finisherDakota Jones;2024 Transvulcania UltramarathonchampionJon Albon(pre-race interview), who is from the U.K. but lives in Norway; 2023 fourth-place finisherJia-Sheng Shen(China) (pre-race interview);2023 Canyons 100kchampionCole Watson; Western States specialistTyler Green(pre-race interview); andJupiter Carera(Mexico).

Then began a thrilling, chaotic second half of the race — featuring a gripping back-and-forth between Walmsley and Farvard, a wildfire near the course, a two-man river crossing, and a sprint finish on the track.
It all started when Walmsley entered Michigan Bluff at mile 55, again looking calm and in control, changing shirts and getting doused with ice. Farvard came in just behind him and left the aid station first, leading the race for the first time since the first climb up the Escarpment. The same routine took place seven miles later at Foresthill: Walmsley entering first, Farvard leaving first.

For the next 18 miles, the two runners alternated in the lead. By mile 78, they were so close that they were crossing the American River at the same time. Their battle underscored the overall depth of the field at this year’s race: At mile 80, the top five men were within 16 minutes of one another.

Around then, the 15-acre Creek Fire, which started not long before, was visible from the final quarter of the course and crews were temporarily not permitted to travel to the Green Gate aid station at mile 80 because the route to it passed close to the fire. Eventually, a reroute was established for crews to get to Green Gate and, later, after the wildfire was controlled, the regular route was reopened.
At Green Gate, Farvard came through in the lead, with Walmsley four minutes back and looking like he was hurting. It was then, perhaps, that the thought entered people’s minds: Could Farvard really take down the champ?
But Jim Walmsley is Jim Walmsley for a reason, and he again proved why he is among the world’s best. Against the ropes, facing one of his first real challenges in the race that shaped him, he delivered, entering the next aid station, Auburn Lake Trails at mile 85, more than a minute earlier than Farvard. He had made up five minutes in five miles.
Walmsley never trailed again, increasing his lead to 11 minutes by the Pointed Rocks aid station at mile 94 and then picking up his crew, including his wife,Jess Brazeau, at Robie Point to run the final mile with him. He entered the track at Placer High School to loud cheers, his loping stride still looking smooth, stopping a few steps short of the tape to wave to the crowd and raise his arms in triumph. He had done it again.

Behind him, Farvard was fading but determined to cap an extraordinary race with a second-place finish. Hawks, who had made up five minutes on Farvard in the couple miles between Pointed Rocks and Robie Point, was on the hunt, and by the time he stepped on the track, Farvard was within sight.
It was then that fans were treated to one of the most unique sights in all of ultrarunning: After 100 miles of racing, two men were sprinting against each other on a track. In the end, Farvard’s lead held, and he finished 16 seconds ahead of Hawks. He collapsed at the finish line — a fitting end to an epic performance.
Dan Jones ended a strong race with a fourth-place finish in 14:32:29, withCaleb Olsoncapping an impressive second half of the race — from 11th at mile 53 to fifth in 14:40:12 at the finish. All five men ran a time that would have won the race last year.

Behind Olson came Jon Albon, running 14:57:01 in his 100-mile running-race debut, followed by the surgical Tyler Green, who finished in seventh for his fourth straight top 10 finish at the race. Green’s time of 15:05:39 also marked a new men’s masters course record, breaking the 2013Mike Mortonrecord of 15:45:21.
Rounding out the top 10 were Jia-Sheng Shen in eighth with a time of 15:09:49,Jonathan Reain ninth who methodically moved his way up during the last 60 miles to finish in 15:13:10; andChris Myersin 10th in 15:18:25.

Through the high country, into and out of the canyons, and along the river of the world’s oldest 100-mile trail race,Katie Schide(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews) raced only the ghosts of the clock and history. Smiling throughout, she seemed unaffected by the solitude and the enormity of the possibility that lay before her: to attempt to break the course record of one of the world’s most iconic trail races.
Schide, an American who lives in France, came into the race as the clear favorite, and for good reason: She finished second last year, breakingEllie Greenwood’spreviously untouchable 2012 course record by more than three minutes and losing to onlyCourtney Dauwalter, who broke Greenwood’s record by an astounding 78 minutes on her way to a historic Western States-Hardrock 100-UTMB triple win. Schide, winner of the 2022 UTMB and 2023 Diagonale des Fous 100 Mile, spent the last two-and-a-half months in Flagstaff, Arizona, training for Western States, winning this year’s Canyons 100k in an impressive tune-up and putting ina monster training block.
In her pre-race interview, Schide said that she had thought about ways to improve her race from last year, which perhaps should have been the first warning to her competition. The second, then, was her immediate separation from the women’s chase pack: She summited the Escarpment, a 2,500-foot climb during the first four miles, in first place and never looked back. By the first aid station — Lyon Ridge at 10 miles — she was already 12 minutes under course record pace, and by Robinson Flat at mile 30, she was 21 minutes ahead of second-placeEmily Hawgood(pre-race interview), from Zimbabwe but living in the U.S.

The lead only ballooned from there. By Dusty Corners at mile 38, Schide was an incredible 26 minutes under course record pace, and though she lost a few minutes from that pace by the time she climbed up to Michigan Bluff at mile 55, her smile had not waned even slightly. She smoothly entered the iconic aid station, doused herself with ice, changed shirts, and was soon on her way. She never sat down.
Twenty-seven minutes behind her was Hawgood, looking to build on back-to-back fifth-place finishes.Eszter Csillag(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), a Hungarian who lives in Hong Kong, followed soon after, in the same third spot she finished in last year.

After them ran a dense pack of women: Only 16 minutes separated Hawgood in second fromLotti Brinksin 11th.

At the halfway point, the top 10 were Schide, 33 minutes up in an elapsed time of 7:26; Csillag; Hawgood; Chinese runnerFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-raceandpost-raceinterviews), the fourth-place finisher at last year’s UTMB;Lin Chen(China); AmericanHeather Jackson, a versatile former triathlete who recently finished fifth at a competitive 200-mile gravel bike race; ultrarunning veteranIda Nilsson(pre-race interview), a Swede living in Norway;Becca Windell, second in this year’s Black Canyon 100k;2023 CCCwinnerYngvild Kaspersen(Norway); andRachel Drake, running her 100-mile debut.
Schide, easily identifiable in her pink shirt, maintained her large lead throughout the second half of the race, remaining calm, controlled, and upbeat throughout the tough canyon miles. By Foresthill at mile 62, she was 19 minutes ahead of course record pace and 48 minutes ahead of the second-place Xiang. Schide’s stride still looked smooth as she waved to fans and even high-fived a cameraman.
Schide’s aggressive pace eventually slowed — by Green Gate at mile 80, her lead on the course record had dissipated — but her spirits did not. After a quick sponge bath at Auburn Lake Trails aid station at mile 85, she fell behind course-record pace for the first time all day, only 15 miles remained until the finish.
Schide entered the track a couple of hours later, running with her crew and no headlamp. She would finish before dark. She stopped for a hug on the final straightaway and lifted the tape with, of course, a smile.

Xiang had methodically pulled away from Hawgood and Csillag during an incredibly strong second half to win the battle for second. Fu-Zhao Xiang finished in 16:20:03 for the third fastest time in race history. Chen, who dropped out at mile 78, was one of the few elite runners who had a DNF on this day, which was categorized by a lack of attrition in both the women’s and men’s elite races.
Eszter Csillag came in about 22 minutes behind Xiang in 16:42:17 for her second consecutive third-place finish, a 30-minute improvement from last year — a statistic that perhaps exemplifies the speed of this year’s race better than any other.

The battle for fourth and fifth was nearly as close as Farvard and Hawks’s race for second in the men’s race a couple of hours earlier.
At Pointed Rocks at mile 94, Hawgood led by barely two minutes, running hard and straight through the aid station. Kaspersen, meanwhile, was drinking Coke and made up almost a minute by Robie Point.

Emily Hawgood’s lead ultimately held, and she finished fourth in 16:48:43 to improve her finish from prior years by one spot. Yngvild Kaspersen was less than two minutes back in 16:50:39. Ida Nilsson capped a strong day to finish sixth in 16:56:52 and breakRagna Debats’smasters course record by almost 45 minutes. That means the top six women all finished in under 17 hours in a race that had only ever had three women finish under that mark — and two of them, Dauwalter and Schide, were last year.
The rest of the top 10 were Heather Jackson in seventh in 17:16:43, and, in close succession, Rachel Drake in 17:28:35,Priscilla Forgie(Canada) in 17:30:24, andLeah Yinglingin 17:33:54.
The top 10 women were all faster than the 12th-fastest time in race history going into the day.

﻿﻿
iRunFar:Bryon Powell of iRunFar here withFu-Zhao Xiangbefore the 2024Western States 100. Welcome, Fu-Zhao.
Fu-Zhao Xiang:Thank you.
iRunFar:You had a very good 2023 season, including finishing fourth atUTMB. How do you feel about your run at UTMB last year?
Xiang:I think it was amazing.
iRunFar:Yeah?
Xiang:Because the first attempt is 20th place and the second is 11th and the third is 7th place, and the last time is first place. I feel very amazing.
iRunFar:Yeah. What was the best thing about the race? Besides the finish, what were you most happy with your performance?
Xiang:[through a translator] The happiest thing is not only the proposal, but also last year I didn’t sleep during the race. The first three years, I sleep every time.
iRunFar:During the race.
Xiang:During the race. Last year I finally didn’t sleep.
iRunFar:That’s the secret. No sleep.
Xiang:Yes.
iRunFar:So no sleeping during Western States?
Xiang:Yes, not. Because it’s more shorter finish.
iRunFar:Than UTMB, yes. So last year, you also came to California for theBroken Arrowraces.
Xiang:Yes.
iRunFar:While you were here did you run some of the Western States course?
Xiang:Last year, actually, I’m a pacer for the third placeEszter [Csillag]Yes.
iRunFar:Yeah? So you’ve seen some of the course then. How long were you here in 2023?
Xiang:Just about one week last year.
iRunFar:Okay. So running the Broken Arrow, pacing Western States, and then home.
Xiang:Yes. Yes.
iRunFar:And this year, you’ve spent five weeks in the United States, in California.
Xiang:Yes.
iRunFar:How have you enjoyed it?
Xiang:Yes. Very enjoyed because I went to a different place for a race. I try walking around. Yes.
iRunFar:So have you managed to do some training while you’re traveling?
Xiang:Yes, of course. Most of the time I train here on the course. Yeah.
iRunFar:What is your favorite part on the course?
Xiang:I think the first 50.
iRunFar:The first 50k?
Xiang:Yes. More comfortable because the weather is better. After, the weather is more hotter and have different grasses. You will, poison grasses.
iRunFar:Yes, poison oak. So you have had great success at big 100 mile races with big mountains, like UTMB, and other races with lots of mountains. This race is both faster and hotter.
Xiang:Yes.
iRunFar:How do you feel about that?
Xiang:Because the UTMB has two miles on the up and the down, so sometimes we can walk or hike, but Western States is too flat [and you have to do] more running, so maybe more tired.
iRunFar:Yeah. So have you trained more for that this year?
Xiang:Yes. When I’m in China I’ll train more flat.
iRunFar:Yes. And you also maybe I think I saw in results, you’ve run some shorter races this season?
Xiang:Yes. Because in China it’s too many races, so every week will have a different race. I will choose some shorter races to train for me.
iRunFar:Especially this course where you have to run fast, yes?
Xiang:I’m not sure, because I go too hard last months, so I will try my best to do too long.
iRunFar:And how are you thinking about the hot weather?
Xiang:Because my hometown is Chongqing, so Chongqing is very hot. Hot, hot, hot.
iRunFar:Very hot.
Xiang:Yes, but it’s different hot. Chongqing is the humid hot. Here is dry hot. No problem. I think hot is no problem. I just don’t like the cold weather.
iRunFar:You don’t like the cold weather.
Xiang:Yeah, yeah.
iRunFar:Well, this is a perfect race for you then.
Xiang:Yes. It’s perfect.
iRunFar:It’s more comfortable.
Xiang:Yes, yes.
iRunFar:What are you most excited about? Why do you want to run Western States?
Xiang:Because the Western States Endurance Run has almost 50 years history.
iRunFar:This year, yes.
Xiang:Yeah. Fifty years of history, and it’s very, the most famous 100-mile race and very limited runners, I guess 400 runners. So it’s very limited, so I want to run it. You must be very lucky to get into the Western States.
iRunFar:Yes. And you are.
Xiang:Yes.
iRunFar:Well I hope you enjoy the race.
Xiang:And I think this is my first time, maybe I will do second time and third time like UTMB. First time, even run not very good, but with another chance, I will do my best.
iRunFar:So you know, to be in next year’s race automatic, if you’re in the top 10 women, you get to come back. Yes?
Xiang:Yes. The goal is to make the top 10.
iRunFar:Good luck.
Xiang:Thank you.

2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k Results: Njeru and Kipngeno Lead From Start To Finish,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-broken-arrow-skyrace-23k-results,"With start-to-finish dominance, Kenyan athletesJoyce Muthoni NjeruandPatrick Kipngenotook first place at the 2024Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k.
The 2024 Broken Arrow Skyrace 23k took place on Sunday, June 23, and was part of the weekend of the Broken Arrow Skyrace festival, including a Vertical Kilometer, 11k, 18k, the Ironface Challenge, and 46k races. After last year’s route was cut short due to poor weather conditions, this year, there was much less snow and a cloudless, warm morning — the stage was set for an exciting race.

The race is 21.75 kilometers (13.5 miles) long and has 1,433 meters (4,700 feet) of vertical gain. It takes place in the Palisades Tahoe ski area, where the legendary Western States 100 begins next Saturday, and routes itself on the resort’s more technical paths.
This race was the season opener for the 2024World Mountain Running Association World Cup, as was the Vertical Kilometer race, which took place two days prior.
Last year’s winners of the women’s and men’s races,Allie McLaughlinandEli Hemming, took part in this year’s event, so the pressure may have been on them to retain their titles. In the end, the Kenyan athletes reigned supreme. Plus, the drama and close racing continued to the finish lines, especially in the women’s race.
Read on for the full story.
The first three miles of the race are the fastest and most runnable part of the course, making it a quick start.Joyce Muthoni Njeru(Kenya) was first to the Snow King checkpoint at 4.6 miles in 40:23. She held a just-under-two-minute lead onTabor Hemming, who passed the checkpoint in 42:03. Less than one minute behind second place was last year’s winnerAllie McLaughlin(43:11) in third followed shortly byJade Belzbergin fourth andDani Morenoin fifth. There may have been a small gap at the front of the race between the leader and the rest of the field, but the competition remained fierce between second through fifth places and beyond.

On a well-deserved descent from Washeau Peak, runners drop 1,200 feet in 2.5 miles to Shirley Basin, passing Siberia (the second checkpoint) on their way at mile 7.8. The women’s race remained steady as the runners held their positions. Njeru increased her lead by another minute (1:21:12) against Hemming (1:24:08), setting her up well for the race’s second half. McLaughlin closed the gap in third place (1:24:59) while the race remained tight, with Belzberg only 30 seconds back in fourth. Moreno (1:28:15) ran in fifth.
After descending into Shirley Basin, the runners next climbed 550 feet back up to checkpoint three at the High Camp aid station at 10.5 miles. It was during the ascent that Belzberg started to make her attack. Njeru (1:44:50) and Hemming (1:47:22) remained in first and second as they passed the checkpoint, but Belzberg overtook McLaughlin, taking over the third-place position in 1:48:15. However, the gap remained tight with McLaughlin reaching High Camp at 1:48:53 and Moreno three minutes behind at 1:52:00.

It was Joyce Muthoni Njeru who crossed the finish line first at 2:11:52. But it was tight.
Jade Belzberg made up a lot of time on the steep descent to finish in second place, just over 30 seconds behind Njeru in 2:12:29. It was an incredible race for the athlete who managed to take a podium spot in the last few miles of the route.
Tabor Hemming came through the finish in third in 2:13:31, while last year’s winner, Allie McLaughlin, finished in 2:14:53 for fourth place. Dani Moreno maintained fifth place in 2:17:04. It was an exciting end for the women’s top positions.

The favorite for the 23k race was last year’s winner and 2023 Mont Blanc Marathon runner-up,Eli Hemming— also the husband of women’s third-place finisher Tabor Hemming. However, it was Kenyan athletePatrick Kipngenowho took the lead into checkpoint one, setting a tone for the day. Kipngeno came in at 32:49, one minute faster than Hemming. He was followed shortly after by Kenyan athletePhilemon Ombogo Kiriago(34:15) andTaylor Stack,who remained close behind in third and fourth. Just 30 seconds later,Meikael Beaudoin-Rousseauentered the first checkpoint at 35:24, a spread of about 2.5 minutes for the top five men.

Meanwhile, Kipngeno continued to increase the gap between himself (1:04:36) and Hemming (1:06:25) some 7.8 miles in at Siberia, the second checkpoint. Situated just after the race’s highest peak, athletes face a challenging climb, scrambling at the top, followed by a steep descent. Next to the checkpoint were Kiriago, Stack, and Beaudoin-Rousseau.
There was less drama in the men’s race, with no significant changes as Kipngeno managed to hold onto his lead on the last incline to the High Camp aid station, passing the checkpoint at 1:23:24 and Hemming at 1:25:21, still taking a two-minute lead on last year’s champion, the same gap as at the prior checkpoint. Another two minutes later, Kiriago crossed through at 1:27:13, followed by Stack (1:28:30) and Beaudoin-Rousseau (1:29:59).
It was no surprise that Patrick Kipngeno took first place, crossing the finish line in 1:45:37, followed by Eli Hemming in 1:47:00 for second place.

It was a great day for Kenyan athletes, as Philemon Ombogo Kiriago came third at 1:50:23 to go along with the women’s and men’s win. Taylor Stack finished fourth at 1:51:12, and Meikael Beaudoin-Rousseau fifth at 1:52:16.

2024 Western States 100 Men’s Preview,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-western-states-100-mens-preview,"It’s another year, and once again, the 2024Western States 100is likely to be one of the most competitive men’s ultrarunning fields on U.S. soil this year.
The point-to-point course from Olympic Valley to Auburn, California, will see runners cover just over 100 miles with 18,000 feet of climbing and a bit more descending on this net downhill course.
Relatively fast conditions and a super strong field saw the 2023 race equal the 2019 race’s mark for the most runners under 16 hours, with 10 such runners. Despite another strong field that sees seven of last year’s top-10 men, as well as course record holderJim Walmsley(2024 pre-race interview) returning, there’s no guarantee that the strong field will produce equally fast times. As always, the potential of a “hot year” looms, with the possibility of turning a track meet into a march of attrition for those at the front of the pack.

Headlining this year’s edition, along with Walmsley, will be two-time runner-upTyler Green(2024 pre-race interview) and reigning CCC, Les Templiers, and Transvulcania championJon Albon(2024 pre-race interview). We also expectHayden Hawks(2024 pre-race interview), who took second in 2022, to feature prominently.
Read on to see who else should be up at the front of this year’s field. We’ll also be updating this article until race day with any last-minute changes.
iRunFar will be there to report firsthand on all the action as it unfolds starting at 5 a.m. U.S. PDT on Saturday, June 29. Stay tuned!

Seven of last year’s top 10 men remain on the entrant list at the moment. Both last year’s champion,Tom Evans,and sixth-place manMathieu Blancharddeclined their invitations to return ahead of last December’s race lottery. Third manAnthony Costalesinitially accepted his spot but has since withdrawn from the race.
Tyler Green– 2nd, 15:04:09 (2023 post-race interview;2024 pre-race interview)
Tyler Green
The top returning runner at this year’s Western States isTyler Green, who took second last year. Tyler also took second at the race in 2021, while finishing fourth in 2022. No other man has seen consistent success at Western States in the 2020s like Green has. And that success isn’t limited to Western States, as last year he also took third at Transgrancanaria and sixth at UTMB. Green ran well in early May, winning the Tillamook Burn 50 Mile, running 16 minutes faster than his time there in 2021, and taking fourth in the accompanying 50k the following day.
Jia-Sheng Shen(China) – 4th, 15:19:42 (2024 pre-race interview)
While Chinese ultrarunners have seen increasing success globally over recent years,Jia-Sheng Shen’s15:19 in taking fourth at last year’s Western States may be the best performance by a Chinese ultrarunner on U.S. soil to date. Less known in the U.S., Shen has been winning ultras since at least 2017. In just the past few years, he’s been third at the 2022 Lavaredo Ultra Trail, first at the 2022 Eiger Ultra-Trail 101k, as well as taking fourth, and then second, at the past two CCCs. So far this year, Shen has been fifth at Transgrancanaria and third at Mount Yun 100k.
Daniel Jones(New Zealand) – 5th, 15:22:15 (2024 pre-race interview)
Daniel Jones
New Zealand’sDaniel Jonesreturns to Western States after finishing fifth in his debut last year. He followed that effort up with a 12th-place finish at UTMB later in the summer. This past February, Jones won the Tarawera 100k, repeating his win from 2023. It appears as though Jones is spending significant time in the U.S. ahead of Western States, as he was second at the Canyons 50k in late April and won the Bryce Canyon 50k in mid May.
Ryan Montgomery– 7th, 15:38:35
While having run a wide variety of events prior to last year,Ryan Montgomerysaw the most success in flat and fast races, such as running 12:59 at the Brazos Bend 100 Mile in 2019, taking fourth at the 2020 Bandera 100k, and running 13:33 at the 2021 Javelina 100 Mile. Then, he finished seventh with a 15:38 at last year’s fast, but decidedly not flat, Western States. Since then, Montgomery took third at the 2023 Javelina 100 Mile in 12:59 and second at the Quad Rock 50 Mile last month. Montgomery identifies as non-binary, and competes in the men’s category.
Jeff Colt– 8th, 15:42:09
Jeff Colt
In 2022,Jeff Coltran 16:51 to finish 11th at Western States. Last year, he cut more than an hour off his time by running 15:42 and gaining an entry into this year’s event by finishing eighth. That improvement wasn’t all that surprising given that between those two races, Colt took 14th at the 2022 Trail World Championships — Long Trail in Thailand and won the 2023 Bandera 100k. While he had a relatively rough go at UTMB last summer, he won the Sean O’Brien 50k this January.
Cole Watson– 9th, 15:54:36
Cole Watsonwas another runner who upped his game between the past two Western States, improving from 14th man in 17:56 to ninth man in 15:54 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In between, he was fourth at the 2023 Black Canyon 100k and first at the 2023 Canyons 100k. Later last year, he took 14th at the 53-kilometer OCC. So far this year, Watson finished well back in the field at February’s Black Canyon 100k before winning the Rattlesnake Dick 50k in late March and taking third at the Canyons 50k in late April, about five minutes behind second-place Daniel Jones.
Janosch Kowalczyk(Germany) – 10th, 16:09:19
Janosch Kowalczyk
In February 2023,Janosch Kowalczykran his way into last year’s Western States by taking third at the Black Canyon 100k. Then, in late June, he ran his way back into the event for 2024 by finishing as the 10th man. That success was no surprise, as in recent years, the German has taken sixth at the 2021 CCC and won the 2022 Mozart 100k. Earlier this year, Kowalczyk showed he should once again be in the mix, having won the Istria 100k in April.

Jim Walmsley
Barring some shocking news,Jim Walmsley(2024 pre-race interview) should return to the Western States starting line as the favorite to take home his fourth win at Western States after taking the past two years off from the race to focus on UTMB. That shift in focus led to him taking fourth at UTMB in 2022 beforewinning in course record time in 2023. Walmsley’s history at Western States is well known. After a few stumbles in his first two aggressive attempts at the race in 2016 and 2017, hewon in a then-course record time of 14:30 in 2018before setting the standard again with hisbonkers 14:09 win in 2019. He came back again in 2021 towin comfortably in 14:46. That gives Walmsley three of the five fastest times ever run at Western States in his three most recent runs. No one else in this year’s race has broken 15 hours on the course. Walmsley’s been quiet on the racing front since winning the Nice Côte d’Azur 100k late last September.
Jon Albon(U.K., living in Norway) (2024 pre-race interview) has been crushing ultras for at least a decade now and is showing no signs of slowing down. Whether it’s a super technical course or a burner, Albon has a chance to win any race he enters. Over just the past two years, he’s been second at CCC in 2022 and won it last year, won Les Templiers last year, not for the first time, and won Transvulcania this year. That said, this will be a step into the unknown for Albon, as I don’t see any evidence of him having attempted a 100 miler, and it doesn’t look like he’s been in a pure running race longer than 11 hours. Still, that lack of experience at the distance needn’t keep him off the podium.
Hayden Hawks
After moving up from eighth in 2021 to takesecond at Western States in 2022,Hayden Hawks(2024 pre-race interview) dropped out of last year’s race with an injury. That was no barrier to Hawks returning to this year’s Western States as he set a course record at February’s Black Canyon 100k. Other than that, Hawks has been quietly strong the past few years, also taking second at the 2023 Tarawera 100k and first at the 2023 Canyons 50k.
Dakota Joneshas had an up-and-down past two years, with a win at Transvulcania and a third at CCC last year, along with a 17th-place finish at Western States last June and another 17th-place finish at Transvulcania this May. But looking back just a hair further suggests there’s no reason Jones shouldn’t be in the mix at the front of the field at any 100 miler, as he wasthird at the 2022 Hardrock 100and won the 2022 Javelina 100 Mile in less than 13 hours.
Petter Engdahl
A Swede living in Norway,Petter Engdahlran his way into Western States with a third-place finish at the Canyons 100k in April. He likely had his best season so far in 2022 when he won the Innsbruck Alpine Marathon, Zermatt Marathon, CCC, and Transvulcania. Interestingly, Engdahl has DNFed his two longest races to date, failing to finish both Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 115k and UTMB last year. Maybe this will be the race in which he finds success beyond 100k.
Rod Farvardis on a definite uptrend at Western States. He DNFed in 2021, was 41st man in 2022, and was 11th man in 2023, missing the coveted tenth place and an automatic entry back into this year’s Western States by all of seven minutes. Fortunately for him, he ran arguably his best ultramarathon to date in April, when he won the Canyons 100k, besting third-place Petter Engdahl by 11 minutes.
China’sJi Duohas primarily raced within Asia and, indeed, mostly in China. That means less direct competition amongst those he’ll face at Western States or even the means of comparing times on shared courses. That said, he did finish 14th at last year’s UTMB in his European debut. Since early last year, he’s also won the Ultra-Trail Ninghai 105k, been third at the 2023 TransJeju 100k, won the 2023 Doi Inthanon 100 Mile ahead of third-place Robert Hajnal, and won the 2024 Mount Yun 100k ahead of third-place Jia-Sheng Shen.
It’s a bit hard to placeJonathan Reain this preview as he’s not run up to his potential in two goes at Western States, finishing 16th and then 14th among the men the past two years. One could then look at his Javelina 100 Mile results, a second to Dakota Jones in 13:05 in 2022 and a win in 2023 in 12:43 and think maybe he’s a flat and fast specialist. But that’s not the case, as evidenced by his fourth place at last year’s CCC behind three men he’ll see again at this race, Jon Albon, Jia-Sheng Shen, and Dakota Jones. Looking further back in 2022, he won races as disparate as the Bandera 100k and Quad Rock 50 Mile. Maybe the third time’s the charm for Rea at Western States!
I’ll admit I’m just learning aboutBlake Slattengrenas I write this preview … and, dang, what an ascendance! Since jumping into ultras just three years ago, he was sixth at the 2022 Chuckanut 50k, second at the 2023 Gorge Waterfalls 100k, and second at the 2023 Javelina 100 Mile, running a 12:58 in his 100-mile debut. Hot damn!
Robert Hajnal
For me, it’s easy to think of Romania’sRobert Hajnalas standing out during the heyday of the Ultra-Trail World Tour in the late 2010s, a time which included him takingsecond at UTMB in 2018and fourth at Madeira Island Ultra-Trail in 2019, but he’s still running strong. In just the past two years, he was seventh and then second at Lavaredo Ultra Trail, as well as ninth at UTMB in 2022.
Mexico’sJupiter Carerahasn’t raced much abroad, but he did take second behind Hayden Hawks at this February’s Black Canyon 100k. Carera looks to have only taken up ultrarunning a few years ago and only has one other 100k on his resume, a win of the small Ultramaratón de los Cañones in 2022. Timewise, his longest race to date appears to have been an 11:18 40th-place at last year’s Trail World Championships — Long Trail in Austria.
Chris Myershas been speedy since jumping into ultras in his early twenties around five years ago, running a 3:31 at Way Too Cool 50k in 2020 and dropping that to 3:21 in 2022. However, it was just last year that he made the leap up to 100ks, finishing fourth at the Bandera 100k in 8:37. He continued rolling along last year, taking third at the Way Too Cool 50k, fifth at the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile, 11th at the Broken Arrow Skyrace 46k, and third at the Mammoth Trailfest 50k. He kicked things off this year by running his way into Western States by taking third at the Black Canyon 100k in February before winning the Gorge Waterfalls 50k in April.
Caleb Olsonran his way into this year’s Western States by winning last autumn’s Grindstone 100k. Since then, he was second at Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k in November and second at the Madeira Island Ultra-Trail 85k this April. Looking a bit further back to 2022, he was ninth at both the Canyons 100k and Speedgoat 50k, while finishing 13th at CCC.

2024 Western States 100 Women’s Preview,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-western-states-100-womens-preview,"With the 2024Western States 100upon us, it’s time to take a look at the women who we think will challenge for the front end of the field!
This point-to-point 100.2-mile race, with 18,000 feet of climbing and 22,000 feet of descending, is always hotly contested, and because heat nearly always plays a factor on race day, we mean this both figuratively and literally.
Unlike last year, where a big winter left snow lingering on the first 25 miles of the course, runners will most likely face more normal conditions this year. The landscape changes caused by the wildfires of 2022 will still be present, and runners will again have to contend with far less tree cover over the middle miles of the course. If the heat turns up for race day, we can expect this lack of shade to factor into the outcome, as runners will undoubtedly struggle to stay cool.
Last year’s women’s race was one for the ages, with bothCourtney DauwalterandKatie Schide(2024 pre-race interview) coming in underEllie Greenwood’s2012 course record of 16:47. Dauwalter came away with the win in a time of 15:29:33 while Schide finished in 16:43:45. While Dauwalter is staying home this year, and Schide’s running has only gotten better, so she’s our odds-on favorite for the win.
It wasn’t just the top two that went fast last year.Eszter Csillag(2024 pre-race interview) ran a time of 17:07, which is the fourth fastest time ever, to take third.Katie Asmuthplaced fourth in 17:21, and fifth-placeEmily Hawgood(2024 pre-race interview) finished in 17:26, which would have won the women’s race most other years. With three of these top five from 2023 returning, we can expect fireworks at the front of the race. And this trio is joined by many other race veterans and rookies looking to go fast.
Read on to learn about more of the top runners. We’ll also be updating this article through race day with any last-minute changes.
You can trust the iRunFar team to be there reporting on the race and how it all plays out starting at 5 a.m. U.S. PDT on Saturday, June 29. Stay tuned!

Six women from last year’s top 10 are slated to return in 2024. Notably missing is last year’s winner and course-record holder,Courtney Dauwalter. Also absent are fourth placeKatie Asmuth, sixth placeTaylor Nowlin, and 10th placeMeghan Morgan.
Katie Schide(U.S., living in France) – 2nd, 16:43:45 (2023 post-race interview;2024 pre-race interview)
Katie Schide
There are very few instances where breaking a course record won’t net you the win in an event, but that’s exactly what happened to Katie Schide last year when both she and Dauwalter went under Greenwood’s record time. One can only imagine the motivation Schide has coming into this year. Winner of the 2022 UTMB and the 2023 Diagonale des Fous 100 Mile, she’s off to a fast start in 2024 with a win at the Canyons 100k.
Eszter Csillag(Hungary, living in Hong Kong) – 3rd, 17:07:55 (2023 post-race interview;2024 pre-race interview)
Eszter Csillag
Finishing third in her first attempt at Western States in 2023, Eszter Csillag brings back her course knowledge in an attempt to challenge for the top spot. The Hungarian living in Hong Kong made her presence known to the ultrarunning world after a standout year in 2022, finishingfifth at UTMB, fourth at the Trail World Championships – Long Trail, and fifth at Transgrancanaria. In 2023, she also won the Translantau 100k.
Emily Hawgood(Zimbabwe, living in U.S.) – 5th, 17:26:22 (2024 pre-race interview)
Emily Hawgood
After two fifth-place finishes in 2022 and 2023, Emily Hawgood is undoubtedly looking to climb her way higher in the finishing order. Originally from Zimbabwe, Hawgood has been living in the U.S. and consistently placing near the front of highly competitive ultras, including taking sixth and 10th at UTMB in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and second at the CCC in 2023. She started off this year fast with a win at the Chianti Ultra Trail 45 Mile.
Ida Nilsson(Sweden, living in Norway) – 7th, 17:43:34 (2024 pre-race interview)
Ida Nilsson
A presence in the ultrarunning world since 2015, Ida Nilsson returned to the ultrarunning scene with force in 2022 withher second place at the Trail World Championships – Long Trail. In 2023, she was fifth at the Black Canyon 100k and won the Canyons 100k before finishing seventh at Western States and later winning the Ultravasan 90k. It was an impressive year, to be sure. She’s seemingly taken a different approach to 2024 by racing less, starting the year off with a second-place finish at Transvulcania.
Priscilla Forgie(Canada) – 8th, 17:46:34
Priscilla Forgie comes back this year looking to improve on her eighth place from 2023. The Canadian had a big 2023, as she also finished second at the Canyons 100k and 12th at CCC. Previously, Forgie won the 2021 Canadian Death Race, the 2022 Squamish 50 Mile, and the 2022 Ultra-Trail Harricana 122k all north of the border.
Leah Yingling– 9th, 17:49:00
Leah Yingling
Running inside the top 10 at Western States in 2023, Leah Yingling continues to show her ability to run at the front of ultrarunning fields. She had a breakthrough year in 2022, including taking sixth at Western States, third at the Bandera 100k, third at the Transgrancanaria Advanced 65k,second at the Canyons 100k, and 19th at the Trail World Championships – Long Trail. In 2023, she also placed eighth at UTMB. Last month, she won the Quad Rock 50 Mile and before that in March 2024, she ran some 400 miles at the lululemon Further six-day event.

Fu-Zhao Xiang
On paper, it seems thatFu-Zhao Xiang(pre-race interview) from China will most likely feature at the front of the race at some point. She is a four-time finisher of UTMB, where she placed fourth in 2023. She also won the Translantau 140k in 2023. Xiang excels in long mountainous ultras, and only time will tell how the heat and runability of the Western States course treat her. It seems that since her win at Translantau last year, she’s focused on speed at shorter events and came away with wins at three 50k or shorter events over the course of two weekends in mid-April. It’s worth noting that Xiang has raced in the area before, as she took fourth at the Broken Arrow Skyrace 46k last June.
Norway’sYngvild Kaspersenearned her entry into Western States by winning the 2023 CCC. Since winning the Zegama Marathon and finishing second at Les Templiers in 2016, she’s consistently run at the front of the field of medium-to-long ultras. She’s shown her talent in everything from vertical kilometers to 100k distances. More recently, she placed second at Transvulcania in 2022 and seventh in the 2023 Black Canyon 100k. Again, it’s unknown how this mountain specialist will cope with the heat, the relatively flatter terrain, and the 100-mile distance.
Ragna Debats
Ragna Debats(pre-race interview), from The Netherlands and living in Spain, has an ultra-racing resume dating back a decade, and she’s never been far from the front of any field. She earned her Golden Ticket entry with a second-place finish at the Javelina 100 Mile in 2023. In 2021, she placed third at Western States and set a new women’s masters course record with a time of 17:41:13. In 2019, she won the Marathon des Sables, so she knows how to cope with the heat, and in 2022, she won both the Istria 100 Mile and Transgrancanaria.
An American living in France, who has based most of her top-level running outside of the U.S.,Emily Schmitzis someone we’re really looking forward to seeing race Western States. Her credentials in mountain ultrarunning surely make her a heavy favorite for a top-10 finish, but she remains a wild card in that we think this is her first 100 miler. Among her top performances over the years have been a fifth place at the 2023 CCC and seventh at the 2023 Trail World Championships – Long Trail. In 2022, she took fourth at the Ultra Pirineu 100k. Some of these races have ranged to 14 hours long, so she’s got all the time-on-feet experience needed for a first 100 miler.
Coming from a triathlon background, gravel bike racer and ultrarunnerHeather Jacksoncould be a force to contend with. While she DNFed her first attempt at Western States last year, she had won the Canyons 50k and placed second at Black Canyon 100k earlier that year. She also won the Javelina 100 Mile in October of 2023. With seven Ironman triathlon wins to her name before retiring from the sport in 2022, she now splits her time between racing her gravel bike and ultrarunning. We’ll have to see how she implements any lessons she learned from her 2023 attempt to improve her performance this year.
Lin Chen
As far as we can tell,Lin Chenfrom China has only raced outside of her home country twice, once when she placed second at the 2023 Trans Jeju 100k in South Korea and then again when she won the 2023 Doi Inthanon 100 Mile in Thailand, earning her Golden Ticket entry to Western States. Her results in China are impressive — rarely does she place outside of the top five in events ranging from 20k to over 100 miles. She won the Anta Hong Kong 100k this January.
Rachel Drakeis on a steep ascendency in the sport, but this will be her debut 100 miler, so only time will tell how she’ll fare with the longer distance. Earlier in 2024, she won the Black Canyon 100k, earning her Golden Ticket, and the Tillamook Burn 50 Mile. Last year, she placed sixth at OCC and fourth at the Kodiak 50k. In 2021, she won the Black Canyon 60k.
Kaci Lickteig
One should never count outKaci Lickteig, a nine-time Western States finisher and winner in 2016. After finishing third in 2019, she’s struggled to refind the form that had her at the very top of the race, finishing 10th, 18th, and 12th in 2021, 2022, and 2023 respectively. But that doesn’t mean her form is gone, a fact demonstrated by her win at the 2023 IMTUF 100 Mile.

2024 Comrades Marathon Results: Gerda Steyn Sets Course Record; Piet Wiersma Wins Men’s Race,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-comrades-marathon-results,"At 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, June 9, in the raucous darkness of Durban, South Africa, more than 20,000 runners, powered by nerves, adrenaline, and the “Chariots of Fire” theme song, crossed the start line of the 2024Comrades Marathonto take part in the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world: nearly 86 kilometers of road running throughout the hills of South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province. It was the 97th running of the event, which has only missed four editions since World War I veteranVic Claphamstarted it in 1921 to commemorate the lives of South African soldiers.

Two of the runners —Gerda Steyn, of South Africa but who lives in the United Arab Emirates, on the women’s side andPietWiersmaof The Netherlands on the men’s — cemented their names in race lore by taking home wins, and sizable paydays, in their respective races. The race has a massive prize purse, with a total 4,092,000 Rand ($217,000) on the line.
Steyn, the defending champion, broke her own course record for the Up run direction by more than nine minutes for her third win at Comrades. She also holds the women’s course record for the Down run when the race is held in the opposite direction, which she set in 2023.
Wiersma, meanwhile, backed up his impressive Comrades debut last year — where he finished second only three seconds behind the winner — with his first win at the race.
The Comrades Marathon famously alternates the direction each year, and this year’s race, which was run in relatively ideal conditions with temperatures ranging from the mid-50s to low-70s Fahrenheit, was the 49th Up race, meaning runners began in the lower-altitude Durban and ended in the higher-altitude Pietermaritzburg. The race featured around 1,750 meters of elevation gain, with most of it during the first half of the race, when the course runs through three of its “Big Five” hills. The Up run, therefore, demands a smart, measured racing strategy.
Read on for full race details.

For the race’s first half,PietWiersma(The Netherlands) seemed content to stay conservative and save his energy for the back half. A two-man pack ofJobo Khatoane(Lesotho), looking for his first Comrades finish, andAleksei Beresnev(Russia), back for a second time after debuting inside the top 10 last year, were within a minute of each other at Drummond, around the halfway mark, with the next runner more than five minutes back and Wiersma sitting in 10th, almost nine-and-a-half minutes off the lead.
But then Wiersma dropped the hammer, increasing his pace to 3:37 per kilometer from 3:58 per kilometer to jump into the top five by the Cato Ridge checkpoint at 56.6 kilometers into the race. That seemingly set the tone for big moves for the race’s second half, where Beresnev was still holding the lead and followed byDegefa Yohannese Lafebo(Ethiopia). With this race, Lafebo was moving up in distance following two top-10 finishes at the Two Oceans Marathon, a 50k race.
South AfricansTete Dijana, the two-time defending champion, andDan Moselakwe, a prior Comrades podium finisher, sat in third and fourth, respectively.
Wiersma continued to run strong and moved into the lead by Umlaas Road, 67.5k, passing Lafebo, and by Mkondeni at 79.1k, he had increased to nearly a minute. Behind him, Beresnev dropped off the pace, while Dijana couldn’t hang on, either. The pair would finish, but outside the top 10 this year.
Moselakwe took advantage of fading runners to move himself into second.Joseph Manyedi(South Africa), meanwhile, methodically moved his way up to finish in fourth, his eighth and best Comrades finish, whileAndrew Davies(U.K.) jumped from 12th to fifth over the course of the second half of the race. This was Davies’ first Comrades finish.
At the finish line, Wiersma would stay clear of Moselakwe by 45 seconds and third-place finisher Lafebo by nearly three minutes.

Full results.
Gerda Steyn(South Africa, lives in the United Arab Emirates), who won the Comrades Marathon in 2023 and 2019 and is also set to run the Olympic Marathon in Paris, France, later this summer, was at or near the front of the race from the beginning. At the 5.5k and Pinetown (18.5k) checkpoints, she sat in a group withCarla Molinaro(U.K.) andLoveness Madziva(Zimbabwe).
Molinaro was a six-time Comrades finisher with her best performance last year in third place, and Madziva was looking for her first Comrades finish after lots of strong performances around the 50k distance. Those three women led a tight pack of runners through Winston Park (29.6k), with the top 10 women all within six minutes of the lead.
But then Steyn picked up her pace by four seconds per kilometer to gap Madziva by almost a minute by Drummond (42.6k), about halfway into the race. By then, the 10th-place runner was more than 10 minutes back of Steyn.
Steyn’s lead only increased over the latter half of the race, but behind her, there was significant movement within the field.Alexandra Morozova(Russia), the 2022 champion and a many-time Comrades podium finisher, made a big move between the Umlaas Road (67.5k) and Mkondeni (79.1k) checkpoints, dropping her pace by nearly 10 seconds per kilometer to pass Molinaro andNobukhosi Tshuma(Zimbabwe) and jump from fourth to second, a position she wouldn’t relinquish. Tshuma was another runner looking to move up in distance after successful shorter-distance ultrarunning.
Perhaps the most dramatic move, though, came from AmericanCourtney Olsen, who methodically made her way into the lead pack throughout the race. By Drummond, she was in ninth place before jumping three spots at Umlaas Road. As Pietermaritzburg approached, Olsen jumped three more spots to finish third. Olsen’s incredible debut Comrades follows up on prior top-five finishes at the IAU 50k and 100k World Championships.
No one, though, could get close to Steyn, who raised her arms in triumph as she broke the tape under a cloudless blue sky and took a small bow, setting a new women’s Up run record and finishing more than 15 minutes ahead of second-place Morozova.

The Cross Country and Ultrarunning Connection,https://www.irunfar.com/the-cross-country-and-ultrarunning-connection,"[Editor’s Note:This article was written by guest contributor — and cross-country running fan —Lydia Thomsonof the U.K.]
“Who’s the guy in the white headband?”
The 2024British Athletics Cross Challenge Londonsenior men’s cross-country race at Parliament Hill in London, England, starts as many would predict. Top British cross-country runnersMahamed Mahamed,Hugo Milner,Jamie Crowe, andJack Millarare all in the lead pack. Also, there is a face perhaps unknown to many of the staunch followers of British cross country, that of British ultrarunnerTom Evans.
From the gun, Evans tucks in neatly amongst the front runners and actually leads for a time. That confident stride is all too familiar to the followers of the ultra scene, but to the average spectator at Parliament Hill on Saturday, January 20, he is a wild card in a white headband bearing the logo of one of his sponsors, Red Bull.
Spectators this day may not know of Evans’win at the 2023Western States 100orthird place at the 2022UTMB, not to mention his wins at the 2020Tarawera 100kand the 2018CCC.

And similarly, followers of ultrarunning may have yet to learn of his involvement in cross country. But Evans is not new to the cross-country circuit. An idle browse of hisPower of 10 profile, a results and ranking website run by British Athletics, shows that he’s been in podium positions in cross-country races since his pre-ultra days.
In his latest cross-country season, he started with a win at the 2024Leicestershire and Rutland County Championshipsmen’s race in early January. His wife, triathleteSophie Caldwell, won the women’s race. His Power of 10 profile shows five cross-country races for the season, including two wins and two second places. His cross-country season culminated at the 2024World Athletics Cross Country Championshipsin Serbia, where he represented Great Britain and got inside the top 50.
But back to the British Athletics Cross Challenge London race. Indeed, commentators on the race’s livestream speculate about how long he would remain in the lead pack, referring to him as an ultrarunner who is “very familiar with the ultra distance.” In the race’s final stages, they concede that he is a silent assassin “biding his time” on the heels of triathlete Milner.
Ultimately, Evans finishes in second place, just three seconds behind Milner, with Mahamed in third. Revealingly, Mahemed went on to place fourth at theTCS London Marathonon April 21, 2024.
In a post-race interview byAndy Hobdell, who coincidentally was Evans’ previous coach, Evans shares that he was doing cross country to get really fit and strong ahead of UTMB later this year. He says he’ll be going for the win at UTMB.
But why cross country? Ultrarunning and cross-country running are not common or natural bedfellows, particularly at the elite level.
We know many elite middle- and long-distance athletes use cross country to build strength for road and track races—but ultras? Surely cross country is too short and spicy for an ultrarunner to excel at.
Not so, say Evans and several other elite runners who mix ultrarunning and cross country quite well. For Evans, the benefits include improving “speed and ability to run fast over changing terrain (mud, hills, and more), as well as practicing the race craft and tactics. You can’t afford to make one mistake in a 30-minute race.”
If you can extrapolate that mentality to a 100-mile race, suddenly, those ultra tactics are exponentially fine-tuned. Evans also used this season to stay fresh while he prepared for the summer on the trails. “Cross country was the main goal,” he says, “but with the bigger goal of getting fast and shifting thresholds to better prep for the mountains without doing crazy volume and vertical over the winter.”
American multi-sport athleteMax King, who is dizzying in his athletic diversity and competes in everything from steeplechase to skiing to ultramarathons, is also no stranger to a cross-country season. He’s done everything from placing second at the 2021Canyons 100kto winning the 2018Broken Arrow Skyrace 26k. He’s also triedpack burro racing.
“Do you need to race cross country to help your ultrarunning? Probably not,” King says. “Do you need to work on that speed and faster endurance to succeed in ultrarunning events? Absolutely. You may not need to race cross-country events, but you do need to work on the same physiology systems at some point in the training cycle. Ultrarunning is getting fast, and you need to run fast to keep up with the pack.”
British ultrarunner and coachRobbie Brittonwill typically compete in both as long as they fit together well. He says it “feels like it makes me strong and fast for the year ahead.”
Likewise, British ultrarunnerRichard McDowellsays, “I pretty much always race a full season of cross country for my club during the winter.” However, in a more recognisably ultrarunner fashion, he would “frequently run to and from races if viable to get some decent miles in on top of the race.”
Richard McDowell (wearing bib 334) is one of several ultrarunners who’ve also found success in much shorter cross-country races. Photo courtesy of Richard McDowell.
Adaptation, flexibility, incorporation. The approach of integrating a cross-country race into a training plan may be familiar to the wider trail running and ultrarunning community. The slightly crowbar commitment might also be quite specific to the British club cross-country scene, where the opportunities to race are frequent, and participating as a way of representing and giving back to your club is a huge part.
So when Evans puts on his Lewes Athletic Club vest to compete in Britain’s top cross-country races, it’s kind of a big deal.
Cross country originated in Britain in the early 1800s as what was called “hare and hounds” racing. The hare runners would set off a few minutes before the hounds, sometimes leaving a literal trail of papers for the hound runners to follow.
The sport developed over the coming years into the iteration we now recognise—running a marked route across country fields—and the firstEnglish National Cross Country Championshipswere held in 1876. USA Track and Field hosted their firstUSATF Cross Country Championshipsin 1883. By 1973, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) established theWorld Athletics Cross Country Championships.
The sport has come a long way, but in Britain and elsewhere, the scruffy, scrappy roots of the sport still ring true. Whereas advances in technology and science have led ultrarunning toward something more precise and engineered, the biggest gear decision you make that will impact your performance on cross-country race day is the length of your spikes. Nuance can actually be applied even here: former women’s marathon world record holder and avid cross-country runnerPaula Radcliffereportedly sometimes runs with longer spikes in the front and shorter spikes in the back.
“Cross country is the main stepping stone for endurance in the U.K.,” says Evans. “County, regional, and national championships always draw a really strong field. Having the European cross-country champs is a huge driver, as it’s the perfect winter race for track, road, and trail athletes.” This has historically been the case and shows no signs of slowing down.
Fast forward to mid-March, and here we are at the 2024UK CAU Inter Counties Cross Country Championships. The first-place finisher is guaranteed a spot at the 2024 World Athletics Cross Country Championships. The next two finishers are eligible to be considered for selection. Runners are aiming for the win and settling for the podium.
Conditions at Wollaston Park in Nottingham, England, are favourable. After a damp winter, there has finally been some drier weather. There’s even a bit of sunshine. It’s going to be zesty.
The lead pack goes out hot and the race quickly strings out. Evans puts himself in the front right from the start. The wall of runners surges uphill and tapers into a natural order. Jack Millar and Jamie Crowe are in the mix again, along withScott Stirling, another top British cross-country runner.
It’s a 10-kilometer course with two short laps and two long laps. By the last lap, Crowe has fallen off the front and Millar seems to have run out of steam. From the back of this lead pack,Calum Johnson, who’s been successfully in British cross country since he was a youth, creeps to the fore.
Evans has a new sparring buddy, but in the final stretches, the elastic between them extends uncomfortably. I can’t watch. There’s a hill, and I expect ultrarunner Evans to make his move here, but Johnson flies ahead, leaving Evans grimacing.
“It’s not over yet,” declare the commentators. It’s a long downhill to the finish, there’s time yet for things to change. Indeed, there is—from behind, where Stirling is gaining on Evans.
It’s no longer just a battle for first but for the whole men’s podium. Ultimately, it’s Johnson’s grin that breaks the tape. Evans seems to be losing second place as Stirling strides up alongside him, but mere metres from the finish, Evans digs again and holds his second-place position by milliseconds.
It’s all just so close. It is exhilarating.
For some, it’s this neck-to-neck racing of cross country that appeals.
Max King has been competing in cross country since high school and says, “I’ve always gravitated toward it and its simplicity. I’m also a competitive person, so I’ve always liked the aspect of cross country where you’re directly racing other people.”
He points out that this is where ultrarunning and cross country can really differ. In an ultra, hours can go by out on the course where you don’t see anybody. Indeed, your nearest competitors are imaginary demons, entities only in time splits if you’re fortunate enough to get them. Yes, many faster ultras can give us nail-bitingly close competition for miles at a time, but it’s not the mass huddle of spikes and elbows that cross country inspires.

In the middle of the following week, it is announced that Evans has been selected to represent Team Great Britain a few weeks later at the 2024 World Athletics Cross Country Championships in Serbia. This is where it all starts to feel a bit bonkers, having a highly successful ultrarunner make a cross-country national team.
No doubt, this means more to Evans than the professional achievement alone. Shortly before the cross-country season began, Evans was due to compete at the 2023Ultra-Trail Cape Town 100k, but while on a training run in South Africa, he was attacked and mugged at knife point. He returned home and did not compete in the race. He says, “I wanted something to focus on after what happened in Cape Town, and qualifying for world cross felt like a great goal. My wife is a pro triathlete training for Olympic selection, so it was nice to stay at home with her and help with her training over winter, too.” Nothing can make up for experiencing a trauma like that which occurred in South Africa, but what a comeback.
Attempting to compile a list of ultrarunners who have competed at the World Athletics Cross Country Championships is not a particularly easy task. It appears that each year’s roster includes perhaps one or a couple of ultrarunners, however.
For a couple of recent examples, in 2023, Chinese athleteMiao Yaowas among the selection and finished 66th. She went on to have phenomenal success the rest of the year, winning theUltra Trail Ninghai100kand placing third at theOCC. So there’s a method in the madness. The pursuit bears fruit.
A few other trail runners were at the World Athletics Cross Country Championships this year.Christian Allen, winner of the 2023Speedgoat 50k, came 37th.Allie Ostrander, who won the 2023Three Corner Rock PCT 50k, was 30th and second American. Evans finished 49th, third British runner.

With the cross-country season over, the focus has moved on to warm, dry trails instead of chilly quagmires of mud. But all that work, slipping and clipping alongside competitors while heaving frosty breaths into lungs to push just a little closer to the line, is all in the system now.
As Tom Evans rolls into the first mile of his 2024 UTMB lap around Mont Blanc, I wonder if his mud-splattered club vest will cross his mind.

2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon Results: Jon Albon and Ruth Croft Win,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-transvulcania-ultramarathon-results,"The 2024 Transvulcania Ultramarathon getting underway. All photos courtesy of race.
TheTransvulcania Ultramarathonis well-known for bringing in talented runners worldwide and being a highly competitive race. The 2024 edition was no different.
Early on the morning of Saturday, May 11, racers set off on their 72-kilometer (44.7 miles) journey, starting at the southern tip of La Palma island, one of the Canary Islands, at the lighthouse of El Faro de Fuencaliente. The race’s finish line is set on the island’s west side in the city of Los Llanos de Aridane. Racers had to use their strength as they accumulated around 14,000 feet (4,350 meters) of gain.
The course is as beautiful as it is challenging. Aside from the seemingly non-stop climbs to the course’s high point just after 50k and a 1,000-foot (320-meter) climb from the ocean to the finish, racers must somehow manage the nearly 8,000-foot (2,400 meters) descent from the high point to the ocean over the course of less than 11 miles (18k). Dominated by singletrack, the course tackles challenging terrain, including loose volcanic pumice and sharp lava rock.
Five years after attempting the Transvulcania Ultramarathon and coming in fourth place,Jon Albonfinally found his way back to the island of La Palma. He claimed his crown, winning the 2024 edition. On the women’s side,Ruth Croftalso found her way back to the island, in her case eight years had passed. She made up for the lost years and not only came away with the victory but also the women’s course record.
Read on for more of how the race played out.
There were no fewer than 9 previous Transvulcania wins represented on the start line, including Dakota Jones (left, 2 wins) and Luis Alberto Hernando (right, 3 wins).
The men’s race was one that wouldn’t be lost early, as at least 10 men rolled into the second aid station at Deseadas (17k) within 73 seconds of the lead. There was a distinct lead pack withJeshurun SmallandDakota Jonesof the U.S.,Tom EvansandJon Albonof the U.K, andThibaut Baronianof France.Ben Stout(U.S.),Dimtry Mityaev(Andorra),Davide Cheraz(Italy), andAntoine Thiriat(France) were all within a minute of the lead.
Fourteen kilometers later, at El Reventón (31k), four of the five essentially remained in the lead pack, with only Jones dropping back to sixth while Stout moved up into fifth at 2.5 and 2 minutes off the lead, respectively. Technically, Baronian was 19 seconds off the lead trio of Albon, Small, and Evans. Cheraz,Ionel Manole(Romania, living in Spain), Mityaev, andTobias Geiser(Italy) rounded out the top 10.
Fast forward to the high point at El Roque de los Muchachos (51k), and we finally started to see some gaps between the top men, even if that was mostly Albon pulling away from the rest of the leaders. Indeed, Albon hit el Roque with a 4.5-minute lead on Small and a 5.5-minute lead on Mityaev, while Baronian and Evans sat 6 minutes back.
Jon Albon in the lead in La Palma’s high country.
From there, gaps quickly grew with Stout at 8.5 minutes, Manole at 18 minutes, andManuel Anguita(Spain) at 19.5 minutes back in sixth through eighth as the only other runners within 20 minutes of the lead. Not long after El Reventón, Jones quickly fell behind the lead pack to eventually finish in 17th.
The colossal 8,000-foot, 11-mile descent down to the seaside town of Tazacorte saw two of the previous top five runners fall back, while three held their position or moved up. Albon hit the ocean with the same 4.5-minute lead he had an hour and a half earlier high atop the island. Ah, but Evans made up 90 seconds to move into second along with teammate Mityaev over the descent.

At the same time, Small fell into fourth at 8.5 minutes off the lead. From there, there was a substantial gap back to the next runners with Manole, Stout,Pere Aurell(Spain), and Anguita all under 20 minutes off the lead. Baronian deployed his parachute on the descent and ended it in ninth, more than 30 minutes off the front.
As the men made their way into the city center of Los Llanos de Aridane, Jon Albon held on to win in 7:03:10.
Making up 2 minutes on Albon over the final 5k climb, teammates Dmitry Mityaev and Tom Evans finished hand in hand, tying in 7:05:16.
Although he lost some time on the descent, Jeshurun Small ran strong over the final kilometers to take fourth in 7:10:54. Ionel Manole threw down a furious final sprint to beat out Ben Stout and hold onto fifth by 11 seconds, with the pair finishing in 7:19:21 and 7:19:32, respectively.

Despite having a stacked field, the women’s race was dominated already in its early kilometers. By Deseadas (17k), Ruth Croft (New Zealand) had a 2.5-minute lead on Ida Nilsson (Sweden, lives in Norway), but Nilsson was, in turn, nearly 5 minutes in front of the rest of the women’s field.
Here,Azara García(Spain) andEkaterina Mityaeva(Andorra) ran in third and fourth at 7 minutes off the lead withMarianne Hogan(Canada) andHannah Allgood(U.S.) less than a minute back.Keely Henninger(U.S.),Sunmaya Budha(Nepal),Emilie Collomb(Italy), andHillary Allen(U.S.) were the rest of the top 10 women at 9, 9.5, 10.5, and 13 minutes off the lead.

Croft continued to pull away from the field en route to El Reventón (31k), where she built a 4.5-minute lead on Nilsson. Budha held strong to move into third place at 12 minutes off the lead while the rest of the women’s field continued to fall off Croft’s furious pace. Hogan and García ran 13 and 14 minutes off the lead in fourth and fifth, respectively. While we don’t have a split for Mityaeva at El Reventón, she was sixth at the aid stations before and after that location.
And then Nilsson dropped the hammer with a tremendous surge to catch Croft before El Roque de los Muchachos at 51k. At the same time, the lead duo continued to build time on the rest of the women’s field. Budha continued to run in third at the high point at 15 minutes off the front. At the same time, Allgood had run her way up into fourth roughly 24 minutes off the front with Hogan holding onto fifth at 28 minutes off the lead.

For perspective on just how well Croft and Nilsson were running up front through 51k, the sixth through ninth women at 50k were Mityaeva,Katharina Hartmuth(Germany), García, and Henninger, all of whom have world-class ultrarunning resumes and yet ran from 32 to 47 minutes off the leaders.
Wow! Of Croft and Nilsson, it was Croft who had the downhill legs on the day. The Kiwi put 8 minutes on the Swede over the 8,000 feet and just over 90 minutes of descending to the ocean. Budha held her own on the descent, actually gaining a minute on Croft, but still sitting in third 14 minutes off the lead. At that point, the women’s podium seemed set with just 5k to go.
Still, only 6 minutes separated the women in fourth through sixth. Mityaeva had made up ground on the descent to move into fourth at 34 minutes off the front. Allgood and Hogan raced in fifth and sixth, at 2 and 6 minutes behind Mityaeva.
Ruth Croft continued her phenomenal run to the finish, coming across the line in a women’s course record time of 8:02:49, lowering Ida Nilsson’s time of 8:04:16 from 2017.
Ida Nilsson rolled into the finish to take second in 8:16:32.
Sunmaya Budha continued to close in on Nilsson, but ultimately finished in third in 8:20:31.
Ekaterina Mityaeva held onto fourth in 8:40:59, while Hannah Allgood finished in fifth in 8:43:23.

2024 Cocodona 250 Mile Results: Entrekin and Subertas Prevail in Dramatic Race Finishes,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-cocodona-250-mile-results-entrekin-and-subertas-prevail-in-dramatic-race-finishes,"With the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile frontrunners having crossed the finish line in Flagstaff, Arizona,Rachel EntrekinandHarry Subertasare winners of the women’s and men’s races. Both prevailed through truly dramatic and fascinating race stories.
The race began at 5 a.m. local time on Monday, May 6, and concludes on Saturday, May 11. This edition marked the race’s fourth running.
The point-to-point route begins in Black Canyon City and finishes in Flagstaff. The course changes from year to year, but this year’s course is said to be 249.4 miles long with roughly 40,000 feet of climbing and 35,000 feet of descending.
On the course, runners experience the diversity of Arizona’s terrain and climate. In the low desert, runnable singletrack and doubletrack give runners terrain simplicity, but that’s complicated by heat and lack of shade from the sun. The course also visits a couple of mountain ranges, which provide shade and cool temperatures but can bring the challenges of altitude, significant elevation gain and loss, and more technical terrain.

A 250-mile-long race offers nearly infinite logistical challenges, with runners needing to stay on point with hydration and fueling, sleep and other forms of rest, gear management, foot care, and so much more.
While the course has changed significantly in most previous years, the records for the current course areSarah Ostaszewskifor the women at 72 hours, 50 minutes, and 27 seconds, and 69:41:31 for the men byMichael McKnight, both run in 2023, the only time a substantially similar course was used.
With all these variables, the Cocodona 250 Mile was sure to deliver surprises for all runners, including those at the front of the race.
Rachel Entrekin, an ultrarunner since at least 2013, championed the women’s race. After running for most of the distance in second place, Entrekin took over the women’s race leadership late to secure the win. This followed longtime women’s race leaderMika Thewes’sudden — lengthy, but temporary — stop around mile 233.
The men’s race came down to the wire betweenHarry SubertasandJeff Browning. Browning, a veteran of at least 150 ultras, led for most of the race. Subertas, winner of the 2022 Tahoe 200 Mile, started the race more conservatively. Subertas’ smart pacing allowed him to pass Browning to take over the lead with just a few miles to go — in a 250-mile race — to win and set a new course record.
Runners continued to trickle over the finish line at the time of this article’s publishing, ahead of the 125-hour time limit. Read on for more of the race story.
Phew, what a women’s race.Rachel Entrekintook over the race leadership late to win after longtime race leaderMika Thewessuddenly stopped during the third night of racing, around mile 233. Entrekin has won several 48-hour races, including most recently the 2023 Across the Years 48 Hour, where she finished with 212 miles. She’s also a 100-mile specialist, as UltraSignup shows she’s won at least eight 100 milers.
But let’s back up to the race start.
When the women settled into the early miles of racing on Monday morning, Mika Thewes, who has no less than twelve 200-plus-mile race finishes, including two Cocodona finishes, with a third place in 2023 and a fourth in 2021, ran as the race leader. Over the course of that first day, other top women’s runners, Entrekin,Aliza Lapierre, andLiz Canty, closely chased.
During night 1, however, Entrekin passed Thewes to assume the women’s lead. As of mid-morning on Tuesday, around 26 hours into the race, Thewes trailed in second place by about two miles, and Lapierre was the third woman.

Around 32 hours into the race, on the afternoon of day 2, Thewes retook the women’s lead, which she would hold for over 100 miles. The pass happened at the Jerome aid station, mile 126 — the race’s halfway point mileage-wise — when Entrekin arrived first, and Thewes arrived second, but Thewes left first while Entrekin stayed in the aid station for a couple of hours, likely to take a nap.
At this midway point mileage-wise, Lapierre maintained third position, despite sharing with the race organization that she was having a rough race thus far. The Brazilian living in Spain,Manu Vilasecaran a couple of miles behind Lapierre in fourth place, looking like she had the potential to move up in the rankings.
As night 2 arrived, Thewes opened her lead on the women’s field to seven miles, while Entrekin and Lapierre continued to occupy positions two and three.
By daybreak on Wednesday morning, the race’s 48-hour mark, Thewes passed mile 175 and had increased her lead to about 9.5 miles. Entrekin ran in second, while, overnight, Vilaseca assumed the women’s third-place position and was now running right behind Entrekin.
During the day on Wednesday, Thewes increased her lead by a lot. When the race hit 60 hours elapsed on Wednesday evening, Thewes was just under 220 miles into the race with a nearly 20-mile lead.
Behind Thewes, Vilaseca and Entrekin were locked in a close duel all day Wednesday, vying for second and third places. Coming up on Wednesday night and 60 hours elapsed, Vilaseca put some distance between her and Entrekin, running 2.5 miles ahead of her.

But this trio still had a fair bit of real estate to cover, and anything can — and did — happen. Overnight on night 3, the landscape of the women’s race totally changed. Entrekin passed Vilaseca to take over second place once again. Then, around mile 233, Thewes suddenly stopped, and it was thought that she’d dropped from the race. Entrekin assumed the women’s race lead, which put Vilaseca in second place.Kylee Drugan-Eppichmoved up into third position.
In the soft light after dawn on Thursday morning, Rachel Entrekin smoothly ran into downtown Flagstaff, to win the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile in 73:31:25. At the finish, she took a seat, shook her head, and said, “So easy.”
Manu Vilaseca took second in 78:04:35. Vilaseca has a big ultra resume dating back to before 2011. Her top races in recent years have included a win at the 2022 Bryce Canyon 100 Mile and 5th place at the 2019 TDS. It looks like this is her first finish of a 200-plus-mile race.
Against all odds, at around the 77-hour mark, mid-morning on Thursday, the race organization shared on the event livestream that Thewes had stopped in the night due to an injury from a fall, sought medical attention, and was cleared by both medical and the race organization to restart the race where she’d stopped. So, roughly 12 hours after stopping, she rejoined the race, assuming third place, with Drugan-Eppich moving back to fourth position.
Mika Thewes finished third, for a second year in a row, in 79:30:12, with some super-fast final miles.
Kylee Drugan-Eppich was the fourth woman in80:04:55, looking fresh and strong during her run to the finish line through the streets of Flagstaff. This looks to be Drugan-Eppich’s first 200-plus-mile race, and it also looks like she has just one 100-mile finish to her name, a win of the 2022 Zion 100 Mile.
Carrie Hendersonwas the fifth woman to finish in 83:37:40. This looks to be Henderson’s second Cocodona finish; she was sixth place in 2022.

Talk about a closing effort:Harry Subertaswon the 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile men’s race by taking over the lead in the race’s final miles to set a new course record. Here are the dynamics of how this played out.
From the starting line on Monday in Black Canyon City,Joe McConaughytook the men’s race out, leading for much of the first day and night. McConaughy was the 2022 Cocodona champion, and he holds the current men’s supported fastest known time on the 817-mile Arizona Trail.
Trailing McConaughy throughout the first day of running were top menJeff Browning,Arlen Glick,Michael Versteeg,Jeff Garmire,Michael McKnight, and others.
Overnight Monday night, on the first night of the race, Browning overtook first-day leader McConaughy to assume the lead of the men’s race. And as night turned to sunrise on Tuesday, and the race clock ticked past 24 hours, Browning had built an approximately five-mile lead.
Browning maintained the same approximate gap on second place during day 2, passing the 150-mile mark with roughly a four-mile lead. Around midafternoon on day 2, some 33 hours in, McConaughy ran as second man, and Glick in third place, only a few miles apart from each other. However, very close to Glick were Versteeg andHarry Subertas, the latter looking super fresh and like he could move up after a more conservative first day and a half of racing.

When the sun set on day 2, Browning’s gap on second place McConaughy was roughly three miles. By now Subertas had moved up to third position.
At sunrise on Wednesday, as the race clock ticked past 48 hours, Browning passed the race’s 200-mile mark. Overnight, he maintained his lead by about four miles. Subertas, meanwhile, continued to move up, assuming second place, with McConaughy now in third at around nine miles back of second. Glick was now in fourth, just behind McConaughy.
During the third day of racing, on Wednesday, Browning’s lead shrunk rapidly as Subertas in second inched closer. At the final aid station, at mile 242, Subertas was only about 17 minutes in arrears. Then, less than an hour later, when the duo came off the final descent for the final three-mile run from the outskirts of Flagstaff to its downtown finish, Subertas led by roughly five minutes, running at a solid clip, while Browning looked to be walking it in.

Harry Subertas arrived to the finish line in Flagstaff, Arizona, the men’s 2024 Cocodona 250 Mile champion, setting a new course record in 59 hours, 50 minutes, and 55 seconds.
Jeff Browning took a super solid second, finishing in 60:19:57, just under 30 minutes behind the winner.
Glick made fast work of day 3, moving solidly into third position. At mile 235, he was four miles behind second place, and seven miles ahead of fourth place. Steady forward movement would ensure him the final men’s podium spot, and that’s exactly what he did. When all was said and done, Arlen Glick took third, in his first 200-plus-mile race, in61:46:57.
In the evening hours of night 3, Joe McConaughy, the 2022 Cocodona champion, finished in fourth place in 64:03:02. Inaugural 2021 Cocodona champion, Michael Versteeg, took fifth in 65:45:20.

"2024 Canyons by UTMB 100k Results: Farvard Has Breakout Win, Schide Storms",https://www.irunfar.com/2024-canyons-by-utmb-100k-results,"At the 2024Canyons by UTMB 100k,Rod Farvardhad a breakout performance to win the men’s race andKatie Schide(U.S., lives in France) ran an absolute stormer to win for the women.
While this year marked the event’s 10th edition, if there’s anything we’ve grown to understand, change is constant at this race. With significant course changes in many editions, this year was no different. Starting at China Wall, a trailhead located in the mid-foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the race traveled roughly east to west — with some deviations — to finish in downtown Auburn, California. Runners traveled an overall downhill trending course, still with over 12,000 feet of climbing over the course of 63 miles.
A chunk of the middle of the course traversed the famous Western States Trail, and included some of its iconic parts, such as the Devil’s Thumb climb, a stiff climb that finishes passing a thumb-looking rock; the Deadwood Cemetary, a historic cemetery; and Cal Street, an almost-20-mile, mostly downhill, and mostly a gloriously runnable piece of real estate.

The race started at 5 a.m. local time on Saturday, April 27, under clear skies, with mild temperatures and relatively dry air predicted all day. This was perhaps a welcome reprieve for runners, as the region had seen significant rainfall in the prior days.
This race held lots of competitive appeal in that it was the last Western States 100 Golden Ticket race ahead of the 2024 event, where the two women and men would earn entry into the race.
The event was also a UTMB World Series Major, meaning the top 10 men and women secured entry into the CCC at the UTMB World Series Finals, which will be held this August in Chamonix, France.
The men’s race went out en masse, with around 20 men within 2 minutes of each other at the first aid station at Deadwood 1 (16k). Leading this loose pack werePetter Engdahl(Sweden, lives in Norway),Rod Farvard, andAdam Peterman. By Deadwood 2 (29k), the second aid station, Engdahl and Farvard still led together, again with a long line of men trailing tightly, at least 10 of them within 2 minutes, including Peterman.
Engdahl and Peterman were running on strong comeback stories, with Engdahl having suffered broken bones with surgery last fall in a bike crash, and Peterman returning after at least a year off due to serious injury. Each would avenge these career complications with finishes today, Engdahl on the podium and Peterman in 13th.
And Farvard, like so many men, was hunting one of those Western States 100 Golden Tickets; with 3 prior attempts at that race, he’d only topped out as high as 11th place, clearly less than his potential.
Among the early near leaders through the first 30k also includedStephen Kersh,Tracen Knopp,Preston Cates, andDrew Holmen.
Michigan Bluff (38k) saw some more of the same, with Engdahl and Kersh leading the train and most of the same men following very closely. Though there were some 6 men right there, Farvard technically beeped into the checkpoint in third place.
The village of Foresthill, 48k into the race, marked something of a transition point in the race where the runners head out of the race’s higher country, and down to the lowest terrain of the Sierra Nevada. The competition was also transitional in Foresthill as it was here where eventual men’s champ Farvard arrived in the lead in 4:13:43, with Kersh about 20 seconds back. Another 2 minutes brought men’s second and third place, Holmen and Engdahl.
From there on, Farvard would not yield the lead. At 61k, the Cal 2 aid station, he passed at 5:16:19 elapsed. This time Kersh checked in a little over a minute back. Here, Holmen was holding in third, 2 minutes off second, andMakai Clemonshad now moved into fourth position, another 2 minutes back from third place. But it was still any man’s race, with a spread of less than 13 minutes between first and ninth places.
At Driver’s Flat (76k), Farvard held tight to his small but solid lead, passing through in 6:33:33. This time, Holmen had moved into second place, 3 minutes behind the lead. Kersh was right there, though, 30 seconds off Holmen.
For the race’s final quarter, Farvard added bits of distance between he and second place, passing through the final two aid stations, Mammoth Bar (88k) and Confluence (94k), with respective 5- and 7-minute leads. Rod Farvard looked totally elated to cross the finish line, winning the men’s race in 8:44:30. He gladly accepted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket.

Behind him, Holmen ran a super steady last 25k, and built a meaningful enough gap on the rest of the field, passing through the 88k and 94k aid stations some 6 and 4 minutes ahead of third place, respectively. When Drew Holmen crossed the line to take second in 8:51:09, he tossed his pack and collapsed to the ground, clearly using most of what he had in him for that performance. After some finish-line contemplation, Holmen declined the Golden Ticket, which meant it would roll down to third place.
But who would be the third-place finisher? As we know, ultimately, Engdahl. After sitting in fifth place as late as 88k, he surged to move up two spots when he passed the 94k aid station. Petter Engdahl’s excellent ultra pacing led him to take third in 8:55:31. He was eager to claim the second men’s Western States Golden Ticket.
Having run a hugely consistent race, Makai Clemens finished fourth in 8:57:38. Stephen Kersh, after pushing the men’s race pace earlier, found himself in fifth at 9:05:56.

The start of the women’s race couldn’t have played out more differently from the men’s.Katie Schide(U.S., lives in France) took the women’s race out, created a gap early, and ran on. By the first aid station at Deadwood 1 (16k), Schide had already built a gap on the field, some 2.5 minutes. She grew that gap by the second aid point at Deadwood 2 (29k) to nearly 9.5 minutes.
Schide, with too many accolades to mention, wassecond at last year’s Western States 100and has her eyes on the prize of that race this year. Undoubtedly, this race was a critical step in her preparations for this year’s edition.
EmKay Sullivanwas a women’s pace pusher over the first 30k, running around Schide early on, assuming the second position after that, and never looking back. Sullivan has loads of strong trail race performances to her name, with all of them at shorter distances than this one.
Mary Denholmfeatured prominently in podium position over the first 30k, having passed through the 16k and 29k aid stations in podium position. Denholm is a 2-time Olympic Marathon Trials qualifier with a 2:36:28 marathon PR, who was basically debuting in trail racing.
Also among the mix for the women over the first 30k wereAddie Bracyas well as AustraliansAnna McKennaandStephanie Auston.
By Michigan Bluff (39k), Schide led by about 11 minutes. Sullivan remained Schide’s closest chaser, with Denholm in third place, just under 13 minutes off the lead.
Ten kilometers later, at Foresthill (49k), the Schide Show was officially in full force, with her arriving at 4:25:14 and with more than 21 minutes of real estate to the next woman. Sullivan and Denholm maintained their second- and third-place positions, around 2 minutes apart from each other. Behind Denholm was also some decent daylight, with fourth-place Bracy coming through about 10.5 minutes after third place.
Schide was truly ablaze at Cal 2, the 61k, some two-thirds of the way down Cal Street, running through in 5:31:21. There, she’d also cracked the overall top 10. Due to a lack of women’s coverage in the live stream as well as issues with Sullivan’s tracking devices, we don’t have her split at Cal 2, but she was in second place here. Denholm was the next woman through in third, 65 minutes off the lead.
At Driver’s Flat (76k), Schide was now picking her way through the men’s top 10, passing in sixth overall in 6:50:38. For the record, that’s 17 minutes back from the men’s leader three-quarters of the way through a trail 100k — some insane running. Schide’s lead in the women’s race would only grow over the race’s final quarter, and she remained in sixth place overall at the finish line. At Mammoth Bar (88k) and Confluence (94k), she led by 44 and 46 minutes respectively.
Ultimately, Katie Schide was the runaway women’s victor in 9:10:10. It’s safe to say that things are looking really good for Schide’s second attempt at the Western States 100 this summer. With her automatic entry based on her top-10 finish last year, the two Western States 100 Golden Tickets would roll down to other women.

Sullivan’s race for second place never wavered. At 88k and 94k, she held a respective 7- and 9-minute gap over third place. EmKay Sullivan cruised over the finish line to take second in 10:01:26. While she cautiously accepted the Western States 100 Golden Ticket at the finish line, she later decided to not officially accept it, which meant it would roll down to another woman.
Behind Schide and Sullivan, the race for the women’s top 10 was anything but set in the race’s final 25k. Denholm, the debut trail racer, ran into problems en route to Driver’s Flat (76k), relinquishing her podium position. At the time of this article’s publishing, she’s not showing an official DNF, but she certainly has.
As the women’s positions fluctuated, it would beAnna Louden (née Kascius)who emerged into the third position by 88k and who would hold it until she finished in 10:24:37. Kacius has about 3 years of ultrarunning under her belt, with top finishes including seventh at the 2022 IAU 100k World Championships, and fourth at the 2023 Black Canyon 100k. She narrowly missed a Golden Ticket by one position at that latter event. This time, she was golden, graciously accepting that Western States 100 entry.
Careth Arnoldfinished fourth in 10:38:42, after moving up into that spot before the 94k aid station. When the second Western States 100 Golden Ticket rolled down to her post-race, she accepted it. Anna McKenna rounded out the women’s top 5, crossing the line in 10:43:31.

2024 Madeira Island Ultra-Trail Results: New Winners with Valmassoi and Dhiman,https://www.irunfar.com/2024-madeira-island-ultra-trail-results-new-winners-with-valmassoi-and-dhiman,"Leaving the seaside village of Porto Moniz at midnight on Saturday, April 27, runners in the 2024Madeira Island Ultra-Trail(MIUT) set off from northwest Madeira on their 115-kilometer (72 miles) run across the small Portuguese island in the Atlantic Ocean. When all was said and done,Martina Valmassoi(Italy) andBen Dhiman(U.S., lives in France) took home the women’s and men’s victories.
But there was a lot of landscape and racing in between.
With 7,200 meters (23,600 feet) of climbing, the route is technical, steep, and demanding. Starting at sea level and finishing on the far eastern end of the island at Machico, back at sea level again, runners travel over countless mountains, including the route’s high point, Pico Ruivo at 1,800 meters (5,900 feet). Thousands of stairs are also infamous on this race course, which adds a unique element to the racing experience. The route treats runners to stunning views of big mountains, the ocean, and everything in between.

While last year’s race was less competitive than other editions, this year promised to serve up fast racing on the women’s side with a list of starters includingAnne-Lise Rousset Séguret(France),Martina Valmassoi(Italy),Claire Bannwarth(France), andMaite Maiora(Spain), who all had the potential to mix it up at the front of the race.
On the men’s side, the likes ofMiguel Arsénio(Portugal),Ben Dhiman(U.S., lives in France),Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon(France), andSebastian Krogvig(Norway) promised a show.
Last year’s French sweep of the event was not to be repeated with new faces dominating the podium this edition. On the men’s side, Dhiman, who placed third at the 2023 Les Templiers, ran near the front of the race for its entirety and pulled away from the rest of the field after the high point, 75 kilometers into the race, to reach the finish line first.
The top 2 of the women’s race stayed tight, and the gap between Valmassoi and Rousset did not open up until well into the second half. Valmassoi, the 2022 TDS winner, ultimately broke the tape at Machico first in a time of 16:14:10.
Read on for the in-depth race story.
While on paper, a number of names were vying for the top spot in the women’s race, it ended as a duel between Italy’sMartina Valmassoiand France’sAnne-Lise Rousset Séguret. After running within minutes of each other for the majority of the race and opening up a seemingly insurmountable gap on the rest of the field, it was Valmassoi who reached the oceanside at Machico first in a time of 16:14:10. Rousset was second with a time of 16:28:27, andMaite Maioraof Spain rounded out the podium with a time of 17:12:22.
Rousset was the first to make her intentions for the race known as she went straight to the front and created a nearly 2-minute gap on the rest of the field just 22 kilometers into the race. Valmassoi along withFiona Porte(France),Sandra Sevillano(Spain), Maiora, andAroa Sío(Spain) followed to make up the top 5 in the early hours of racing. As the racers traversed the rugged mountains of Madeira, it became clear that it was shaping up to be a 2-woman race between Rousset and Valmassoi. Just 30k in, they’d stretched the gap to third-place Maiora to more than 15 minutes.

By the time the women reached the course high point at Pico Ruivo, nearly 75k into the race, the gap between the top 2, Valmassoi and Rousset, who were still close to each other, and third-place Maiora was up to 30 minutes.Claire Bannwarthof France was another 30 minutes back in fourth, with Sío in fifth just 30 seconds behind her.
From Pico Ruivo, at an elevation of 1,800 meters, it’s a long 40k downhill run to the ocean, with plenty of climbs included to keep things interesting. As the women headed toward the ocean, Valmassoi increased the 3-minute lead she held on Rousset as the 2 had crossed over the course high point. By Chão da Lagoa at the 84k mark, the gap was up to about 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, Maiora kept pace with the lead duo and maintained the 30-minute gap up to second. Behind her, Bannwarth and Sío continued to run near each other an additional 35 minutes in arrears.
Valmassoi was first to Machico, holding on to a 14-minute gap over second-place Rousset. Maiora rounded out the podium in a time of 17:12:22.
Claire Bannwarth and Aroa Sio finished fourth and fifth respectively, with times of 17:50:24 and 18:14:53.

While there was plenty of strong racing at the front end of the race in the early hours of the event, it was ultimatelyBen Dhiman, from the U.S. but who lives in France, who reached the ocean at Machico first in a time of 13:52:46. He was followed by Norway’sSebastian Krogvigand France’sMartin Kernwho finished in 14:12:54 and 14:15:23, respectively. Fourth placeAnthony Costaof France was just 17 seconds behind. The top four men established themselves at the front at Pico de Ruivo, the high point of the race at about 75k, and never looked back.
Early on in the event, all of the expected top names featured at the pointy end of the race, includingMiguel Arsénio(Portugal),Arthur Joyeux-Bouillon(France),Luís Fernandes(Portugal), Dhiman,Jeff Mogavero(U.S.), Krogvig, and Kern. This lead group was within minutes of each other for the first 20k of rugged Madeira mountains.
Dhiman and Arsenio seemed to be on a mission to push the pace early on in the race and ran in close proximity to each other until Estanquinhos, 33k into the race. From there, it seemed like the racing was properly on, with the two of them changing leads over the next 30k.

Their pace opened up a large gap on the rest of the field. After 48k of racing, the trio of Krogvig, Kern, and Mogavero were close together coming into the Encumeada checkpoint, with the time gap between them under a minute as they battled for third place on the ground. Their gap to the front 2 leaders was nearly 10 minutes just under halfway into the race.Brian Culmo(U.S.),Francesco Cucco(Italy), and Costa followed the top 5, another 20 minutes back.
As the kilometers ticked by and runners reached the course high point 75 kilometers into the race, Dhiman established a clear lead on the field as Arsénio faded back and eventually dropped from the event. Krogvig, Kern, and Costa made up the rest of the top 5 at the checkpoint, with second through fourth all within 20 minutes of one another. With Arsénio dropping out, there were now 2 podium places to fight for on the back half of the course.
With all the big climbs over, runners simply had to make it back to the ocean. But it was far from all downhill with several significant inclines to negotiate in the final 40k. Still, very little changed at the front of the race from the high point to the finish, with Dhiman continuing to run steady at the front of the field and Krogvig, Kern, Costa, and Mogavero behind, making up the top 5. Portuguese runnersNelson Santosand Fernandez did their best to maintain contact with the lead.
In the final kilometers of the race, first place seemed secured, but the battle between second and fourth stayed tight. Krogvig was able to hold on to second and Kern just edged out Costa by just 17 seconds to capture the final podium place. Santos was able to close the gap to Mogavero to round out the top 5.
Update:Sebastian Krogvig(Norway) was originally reported to have finished second in 14:12, but he received an hour time penalty due to following an incorrect route near Chão da Lagoa at the 84k mark, and, now, he sits in seventh place in 15:12. That moves Kern into third, Costa into fourth, and Mogavero into fifth in 15:01:01.
